# Getting Started
The quickest way to familiarize yourself with the Snorkel library is to walk through the [Get Started](http://snorkel.org/get-started/) page on the Snorkel website, followed by the full-length tutorials in the [Snorkel tutorials](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials) repository.
These tutorials demonstrate a variety of tasks, domains, labeling techniques, and integrations that can serve as templates as you apply Snorkel to your own applications.


# Installation

To install Snorkel, we recommend using `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel#egg=snorkel
```

Or to install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel
cd snorkel
pip3 install -U .
```

We're updating our PyPi and Conda Forge packages, so those will be available soon.


# Discussion

## Issues
We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel/issues) for posting bugs and feature requests — anything code-related.
Just make sure you search for related issues first and use our Issues templates.
We may ask for contributions if a prompt fix doesn't fit into the immediate roadmap of the core development team.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from the Snorkel community! 
This is likely the fastest way to get a change you'd like to see into the library.

Small contributions can be made directly in a pull request (PR).
If you would like to contribute a larger feature, we recommend first creating an issue with a proposed design for discussion. 

To set up a development environment for contributing back to Snorkel, see our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
All PRs must pass the continuous integration tests and receive approval from a member of the Snorkel development team before they will be merged.

## Community Forum
For broader Q&A, discussions about using Snorkel, tutorial requests, etc., use the [Snorkel community forum](https://spectrum.chat/snorkel) hosted on Spectrum.
We hope this will be a venue for you to interact with other Snorkel users — please don't be shy about posting!

## Announcements
To stay up-to-date on Snorkel-related announcements (e.g. version releases, upcoming workshops), subscribe to the [Snorkel mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/snorkel-ml). We promise to respect your inboxes — communication will be sparse!
