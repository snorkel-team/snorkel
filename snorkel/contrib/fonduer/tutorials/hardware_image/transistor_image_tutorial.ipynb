    "We will walk through the process of using `Fonduer` to extract images from [**richly formatted** data](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/fonduer.html), where information is conveyed via combinations of textual, structural, tabular, and visual expressions, as seen in webpages, business reports, product specifications, and scientific literature.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we use `Fonduer` to identify mentions of the image of transistors in a corpus of transistor datasheets from [Digikey.com](https://www.digikey.com/products/en/discrete-semiconductor-products/transistors-bipolar-bjt-single/276).\n",

Furthermore, `Fonduer` iterates over its input _corpus_ and transforms each document into a unified data model, which captures the variability and multimodality of richly formatted data. This unified data model then servers as an intermediate representation used in the rest of the phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessed data is saved to a database. Connection strings can be specified by setting the `SNORKELDB` environment variable. If no database is specified, then SQLite at `./snorkel.db` is created by default. However, to enabled parallel execution, we use PostgreSQL throughout this tutorial.\n",
