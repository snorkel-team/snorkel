    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using `Fonduer` to identify mentions of the maximum storage temperature of transistors (e.g. `150°C`) in a corpus of transistor datasheets from [Digikey.com](https://www.digikey.com/products/en/discrete-semiconductor-products/transistors-bipolar-bjt-single/276).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is broken into several parts, each covering a Phase of the `Fonduer` pipeline (as outlined in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05028)), and the iterative KBC process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. KBC Initialization\n",
    "2. Candidate Generation and Multimodal Featurization\n",
    "3. Probabilistic Relation Classification\n",
    "4. Error Analysis and Iterative KBC\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we show how users can iteratively improve labeling functions to improve relation extraction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 1: KBC Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first phase of `Fonduer`'s pipeline, `Fonduer` uses a user specified _schema_ to initialize a relational database where the output KB will be stored. Furthermore, `Fonduer` iterates over its input _corpus_ and transforms each document into a unified data model, which captures the variability and multimodality of richly formatted data. This unified data model then servers as an intermediate representation used in the rest of the phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessed data is saved to a database. Connection strings can be specified by setting the `SNORKELDB` environment variable. If no database is specified, then SQLite at `./snorkel.db` is created by default. However, to enabled parallel execution, we use PostgreSQL throughout this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize several variables for convenience that define what the database should be called and what level of parallelization the `Fonduer` pipeline will be run with. In the code below, we use PostgreSQL as our database backend."

    "A labeling function isn't anything special. It's just a Python function that accepts a `Candidate` as the input argument and returns `1` if it says the Candidate should be marked as true, `-1` if it says the `Candidate` should be marked as false, and `0` if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are unipolar: it labels only 1s and 0s, or it labels only -1s and 0s.\n",

    "At this point, we should be getting an F1 score of around 0.6 to 0.7 on the development set, which is pretty good! However, we should be very careful in interpreting this. Since we developed our labeling functions using this development set as a guide, and our generative model is composed of these labeling functions, we expect it to score very well here!\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it is probably somewhat overfit to this set. However this is fine, since in the next tutorial, we'll train a more powerful end extraction model which will generalize beyond the development set, and which we will evaluate on a blind test set (i.e. one we never looked at during development).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the Discriminative Model\n",
    "Now, we'll use the noisy training labels we generated in the last part to train our end extraction model. For this tutorial, we will be training a simple - but fairly effective - logistic regression model. More generally, however, Snorkel plugs in with many ML libraries including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), making it easy to use almost any state-of-the-art model as the end extractor!\n",
