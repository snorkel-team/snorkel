    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through the process of using `Fonduer` to extract relations from [**richly formatted** data](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/fonduer.html), where information is conveyed via combinations of textual, structural, tabular, and visual expressions, as seen in webpages, business reports, product specifications, and scientific literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use `Fonduer` to extract relations between paleontological formations and their corresponding physical measurements from paleontology journal articles on fossils and ancient organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is broken into several parts, each covering a Phase of the `Fonduer` pipeline (as outlined in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05028)):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. KBC Initialization\n",
    "2. Candidate Generation and Multimodal Featurization\n",
    "3. Probabilistic Relation Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 1: KBC Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first phase of `Fonduer`'s pipeline, `Fonduer` uses a user specified _schema_ to initialize a relational database where the output KB will be stored. Furthermore, `Fonduer` iterates over its input _corpus_ and transforms each document into a unified data model, which captures the variability and multimodality of richly formatted data. This unified data model then servers as an intermediate representation used in the rest of the phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessed data is saved to a database. Connection strings can be specified by setting the `SNORKELDB` environment variable. If no database is specified, then SQLite at `./snorkel.db` is created by default. However, to enabled parallel execution, we use PostgreSQL throughout this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize several variables for convenience that define what the database should be called and what level of parallelization the `Fonduer` pipeline will be run with. In the code below, we use PostgreSQL as our database backend. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue, please make sure that you have PostgreSQL installed and have created a new database named `formation_measurement`."

    "* We may have access to an external knowledge base that lists some pairs of formations and measurements, and can use these to noisily label some of our mention pairs.\n",
    "Our labeling functions will capture these types of strategies. We know that these labeling functions will not be perfect, and some may be quite low-quality, so we will model their accuracies with a generative model, which `Fonduer` will help us easily apply.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A labeling function isn't anything special. It's just a Python function that accepts a `Candidate` as the input argument and returns TRUE (`1`) if it says the Candidate should be marked as true, FALSE (`-1`) if it says the `Candidate` should be marked as false, and ABSTAIN (`0`) if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are unipolar: they only label TRUEs and ABSTAINs, or only FALSEs and ABSTAINs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to ultimately train a high-performance classification model that predicts which of our Candidates are true mentions of formation measurement relations. It turns out that we can do this by writing potentially low-quality labeling functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "With `Fonduer`, labeling functions can be written using intuitive patterns discovered by inspecting the target corpus. A library of labeling function helpers can be found in `snorke.contrib.fonduer.lf_helpers`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, inspecting several document may reveal that measurement values are typically listed inside a table where the row header contains the measurement keywords. This intuitive pattern can be directly expressed as a labeling function. Similarly, the measurement keywords is an obvious positive signal."

Also note that we are using `Fonduer`'s optimized batch label annotator, which runs in parallel and depends on having Postgres as the backend database. \n",

    "- `clear` can be `True` or `False`, and is `True` by default. When set to `False`, the labeling function table is not dropped, and the behavior of `labeler.apply` is defined by the following two parameters.\n",
    "- `update_keys` can be `True` or `False`. When `True`, the keys (which are each labeling function) are updated according to the set of labeling functions provided to the function. This should be set to `True` if new labeling functions are added. When `False`, no new LFs are evaluated and the keys of existing LFs remain the same.\n",
    "- `update_values` can be `True` or `False`. This defines how to resolve conflicts. When `True`, the values assigned to each candiate is updated to the new values when in conflict. This should be set to `True` if labeling function logic is edited, even though the name of the labeling function remains the same. When `False`, the existing labels assigned to each candidate are used, and newly computed labels are ignored.\n",
