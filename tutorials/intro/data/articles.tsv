Source: News Limited  \n        \n A BRINSMEAD man who dissolved his wife in acid is considering taking his bid for freedom to the highest court in Australia.  \n   \nIt has been almost two years since Klaus Andres, 71, was handed a life sentence for the 2011 killing of wife Li Ping Cao. \n\nThroughout his December 2013 trial he admitted to dissolving her body in acid, but said her death beforehand had been an accident. \n\nHe launched an appeal against his sentence, but earlier this month that was dismissed by the Queensland Supreme Court. \n\nAndres is still facing a further six minor charges including interference with a corpse and fraud related to the use of his wife’s credit card. \n\nThose charges were mentioned in the Cairns Magistrates Court yesterday where defence solicitor Stephen O’Reilly said they had virtually been stalled as they were reliant on the outcome of a possible High Court appeal. \n \n“We remain essentially in a holding pattern,” he said. \n\n“He is awaiting advice on leave to appeal to the High Court. \n\n“(The summary charges) formed part of the factual matrix of the murder.” \n\nSpeaking outside court, Mr O’Reilly said he was unsure if Andres would lodge the appeal and he was no longer his legal representative. \n\n“I’ve written to him to explain to him his options, but I’m not acting for him (at the moment),” he said. \n\n“I’m awaiting further instructions.” \n\nThere is no guarantee the case will be heard by the High Court and those wishing to appeal their sentence must attend a preliminary hearing to persuade the court there are special reasons for it to be heard. \n\nIf Andres’ case is heard, that court’s decision will be final with no other avenue of appeal available. \n\nHe argued in his Queensland Supreme Court appeal that a letter from Centrelink tendered by the prosecution during the trial would “infer intent or premeditation”. \n\nThe letter, typed after his wife’s death, requested that her carer payments be transferred to his account. \n\nBut the appeal was dismissed with the three presiding judges agreeing there was no way Andres had not intended to kill his wife. \n\nAndres is currently serving his sentence in Lotus Glen Correctional Centre. The six minor charges have been adjourned until December 14.
0004_4233a2bb-4611-4993-9fe4-da863fe62488	Mobsters and the movies have been pulling jobs together for nearly a century now, and audiences have been all too happy to aid and abet since the days of "Little Caesar" and "The Public Enemy" in 1931. We sure love a gangster tale. On some level, we admire the moxie it takes to exploit the American Dream with such ruthlessly single-minded purpose -- and hey, what's a few casually cruel murders along the way? For all his eclecticism, Johnny Depp clearly has the gangster bug, returning to the criminal milieu every few years, in "Donnie Brasco" (1997), "Blow" (2001), "Public Enemies" (2009), and now "Black Mass," which opens in theaters Friday, September 18. "Crazy Heart" writer-director Scott Cooper helmed the drama, based on the 2000 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, which tells the sordid tale of Whitey Bulger, a merciless South Boston mobster who collaborated with the Feds to bring down his Italian rivals. Following are nine more captivating criminal characterizations of America's Most Wanted and the books and other source material that inspired them. \n \n"American Gangster" (2007) \nOscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List") turned Mark Jacobson's 2000 New York magazine article " The Return of Superfly ," about 1970s-era New York City heroin kingpin Frank Lucas, into a very successful crime drama directed by Ridley Scott. The most impressive thing about Lucas (played by Denzel Washington) and his hundred-million-dollar empire is how ingenious and shrewd his business strategies were, with the "American" in the title nodding appropriately to a guy who embraced and embodied the capitalist spirit as well as any legit entrepreneur. \n \n"White Heat" (1949) \nThis classic noir starring James Cagney was inspired by any number of real hoods and crimes that took place in the 1920s and '30s, including Francis "Two Gun" Crowley, a New York City criminal who was captured and executed at age nineteen. Cagney's unhinged Cody Jarrett has to orchestrate a prison escape, manage treachery inside his gang and his marriage, outrun the Feds, and avenge the murder of his beloved Ma, before going out in one of the greatest film finales ever devised. \n \n"Public Enemies" (2009) \nMichael Mann ("The Insider") co-wrote and directed this three-fer based on Bryan Burrough's 2004 book , Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 , which details the war J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men waged on John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson in 1930s Chicago. As usual, Mann brings a confident, meticulous authenticity to the tone and locations, and the all-star cast -- Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard -- mount grounded depictions of the real people that defined a dark, exciting chapter of American gangsterism, an era that fed Hollywood crime films and was informed by them in return. \n \n"Scarface" (1932) / "The Untouchables" (1987) \nPaul Muni is brutal mob boss Tony Camonte in the classic Howard Hawks-directed adaptation of Armitage Trail's 1929 novel, inspired by the rise and fall of real-life Chicago mob boss Al Capone. Oscar winner Ben Hecht ("Notorious") wrote the script. Half a century later, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet based his Brian De Palma-directed screenplay on the autobiographical book by Oscar Fraley and federal agent Eliot Ness, who waged a bloody crusade to bring down Capone during Prohibition (this time played by Robert De Niro). \n \n"Boardwalk Empire" (2010-14) \nSteve Buscemi won a Golden Globe for his nuanced portrayal of real-life politician-turned-racketeer Enoch "Nucky" Johnson, the central figure in HBO's popular Prohibition Era crime saga, which was based on the 2002 book Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City by New Jersey Superior Court judge Nelson Johnson. Created by award-winning "Sopranos" writer Terence Winter and launching with a pilot directed by Martin Scorsese, the man who's most defined the post-modern cinema gangster, this series was in artful creative hands from the start. Its five seasons provided plenty of gritty graft-filled drama that showed just how the criminal element can become an essential part of a fledgling city's DNA. \n \n"GoodFellas" (1990) / "Casino" (1995) \nScorsese and author Nicholas Pileggi crafted two instant-classic late-era mob sagas, the former based on Pileggi's 1985 book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family , the latter on his 1995 work Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas -- both fully describing the gangster culture with precise detail, the vicious logic of violence, and witty pitch-black humor. Both are inspired by real people and real events of certain renown in the annals of crime, and whether it all actually happened like that or not, the actors and filmmakers have us completely convinced that it did. \n \n"Gangs of New York" (2002) \nHerbert Asbury's 1927 book, The Gangs of New York, details the violent, squalid history of the mid-nineteenth-century New York underbelly, which screenwriters Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan, and Jay Cocks reworked into a brutal birth-of-America story, also directed by Scorsese. Nominated for ten Oscars, the expansive epic nails the squalor and cynicism of the time, and provides Daniel Day-Lewis the opportunity to create one of the greatest villains ever in knife-wielding gang leader Bill "The Butcher" Cutting. \n \n\n \nThe post Mobsters With Moxie: 'Black Mass' & 9 More Great Gangster Flicks appeared first on Word and Film .

That long-term outcome is more durable than one a military strike would bring about,” Carter wrote. \n \n“While I am responsible for that alternative and know that it would be effective at setting back Iran’s nuclear programme, it would do so with potentially serious second- and third-order repercussions, and the likely need to repeat attacks once Iran sought to rebuild its capability.” \n \nBut Carter argued the deal also made the option of military action by the US against Iran stronger going forward. \n \nRead: Israeli action against Iran would be ‘huge mistake’: Kerry \n \n“The military option is real today and, as secretary of defense, I will be sure that remains true well into the future,” he wrote. \n \n“Indeed, the reality is that any prospective military option, if called for, will be more effective under this deal — not less. Iran will have a smaller and more concentrated civil nuclear programme, and the deal’s verification provisions will give us more information with which to plan.” \n \nUS President Barack Obama earned enough backing in Congress this week to make sure the deal is not blocked by lawmakers. The agreement will ease Western sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran curtailing its nuclear programme. \n \nRead: Iran, big powers clinch landmark nuclear deal \n \nMany Republicans, however, believe the Islamic republic will still seek to cheat its way to developing an atomic bomb. \n \nA public relations battle was launched over the agreement, which is to be put to a vote in Congress next week. \n \nTehran has steadfastly denied the claims it is developing a nuclear bomb and argued that its nuclear capabilities were for civilian use. \n \nThe post Pentagon chief says Iran deal strengthens US military option appeared first on The Express Tribune .

(Reuters) - A Connecticut man named as a person of interest in the disappearance of his parents last month was arrested on Tuesday on a federal firearms charge, authorities said. \n \nKyle Navin, 27, of Bridgeport, was charged with possessing a firearm while being a user of illegal drugs, according to Deirdre Daly, U.S. attorney for Connecticut. \n \nHis parents, Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin, were last seen on Aug. 4. A search of the younger Navin's home turned up plastic bags containing heroin residue, hypodermic needles and a receipt from a shooting range dated Aug. 5, prosecutors said in a statement. \n \nJeffrey Navin, 56, the president of waste disposal company J&J Refuse, and his wife, Jeanette, 55, a school paraprofessional, had accumulated more than $2.2 million in debts before they were reported missing by relatives on Aug. 7, police said. \n \nTwo days later, the couple's 2003 Dodge pickup was found in a commuter lot in Westport, Connecticut, off a parkway near Jeffrey Navin's business. Police said a bullet hole and blood were found in the truck. They are investigating whether foul play was involved. \n \nKyle Navin, an operations manager at his father's company, was also missing for about a week after being interviewed by detectives. He was later found staying with friends in Westport. \n \nThe case had initially been treated as a missing persons probe, as friends reported the couple liked to take impromptu vacations. But their lengthy absence led a special state police crime squad to take over the investigation. \n \nIt was not immediately clear if the younger Navin, who was taken into custody, had retained an attorney. \n \nIf convicted of possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in federal prison. \n \n(Editing by Scott Malone and Peter Cooney)
0010_38a3df1a-126f-4c4f-ba68-154174d0c067	A roundup of the world's top nightclubs generally reads like a roll call of Europe's ritziest cities, with an obligatory nod to U.S. cities like New York and Los Angeles. Yet nestled in an unassuming strip mall in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico is Hardpop, an electronic dance music oasis with one of the most enthusiastic club-going audiences anywhere - and an equally impressive sound system. After completely re-engineering its sound system with Powersoft power amplifiers earlier this year, Hardpop has emerged from a local favorite to an internationally recognized hotspot for the EDM genre. \n\nBig Dreams \nSince founding the club in 2005, owner Ricardo Tejada grew Hardpop into a lynchpin of the community, but his aspirations did not end there. He wanted Hardpop to bring the world's top DJs to the people of Ciudad Juárez. "When he started contacting big names about coming to Juárez, a common response was, 'Look, you're going to have to do something really special with your sound system to get us to make the trip." That's when he reached out to installed sound expert Bill Weir, who knew it would take the unrivaled performance and quality of Powersoft power amplifiers to make Ciudad Juárez a true dance epicenter in the western hemisphere. \n   \nWeir knew that Hardpop's new sound system would have to meet the frequency range demands of contemporary electronica. "Modern dance music has bottom end that simply did not exist a decade ago," Weir says. "We're being asked to make well-controlled trips into that sub-bass frequency range while maintaining 18 dB of headroom on top of that." According to Weir, Powersoft was the only manufacturer that could deliver the needed headroom with sufficient clarity and intelligibility across all frequencies. \n\nTejada, who considers himself an audiophile, was immediately onboard for an all-Powersoft overhaul. "He had just returned from Europe and had heard Powersoft in clubs over there. He realized there was a certain harshness with Hardpop's old system that simply didn't exist in the Powersoft-driven systems," Weir recalls. "Because of its challenging location, Hardpop needed more than just acceptable sound quality. We have to try harder and do more than your average European club. On the amplification side, we needed Powersoft to achieve this." \n\nA Fully Re-imagined Sound System \nQuality audio performance aside, there was another compelling reason why a Powersoft solution fit like a glove: power upgrades for the building were not an option. Therefore the installation team had to ascertain more output from their sound system with the same current draw. "Powersoft allowed us to go from 47% efficient to 96% efficient, so we were able to shoehorn another 20 kW without any power system upgrades, which is unbelievable," Weir explains. \n\nThe fully re-imagined sound system includes a K8 amplifier for the front subwoofers, a pair of M30D amplifiers for rear subwoofers and four K2 amplifiers for the main speaker cabinets. Additionally an M28Q amplifier powers the stage monitors, with an M50Q amplifier powering the monitor subs. There is also a Powersoft M28Q amplifier, which drives zone fills. Once the installation was complete, Weir made ample use of Powersoft's Armonía software to balance the room with equalization. "There's no one with better EQ algorithms than Powersoft, and having outboard EQ feels almost unnecessary now," he says. \n\nPower to the People -- and the Artists \nThe crowds responded immediately to the Powersoft overhaul, and Weir is proud that the system not only pushes high sound levels, yet respects its listeners' ears. "This isn't like a bar where people are going to be there for two hours, drink, and then hop to the next place to see the next act," Weir explains. "People get there at 9:00 p.m. and they stay there for 6 to 8 hours sometimes. For that length of time, you've got to be careful of peoples' hearing, and I can achieve a level of subtlety and finesse with Powersoft that I can't get with any other brand." The Powersoft gear's minuscule physical footprint also leaves plenty of space for the dance floor. "We've got almost 70 kW RMS in that system and it's all in an 18-space rack with some blanks to spare," Weir adds. \n\nThe word is out to artists. Hardpop has hosted renowned DJs such as James Lavelle, Magda, Damian Lazarus, and Deadmau5. "We have Sasha coming through in a few weeks," Weir notes. "A lot of artists now know about the place because of the level of the sound system." But Weir says the attention Hardpop's sound system is getting from artists is about more than simple brand-name recognition. "They know that by having Powersoft behind them, they will be able to make the crowd. Some of the DJs have told us the monitors sound so good they can get a little distracted up there just listening!" says Weir, laughing. \n\nHope, Sounding Off \nDancing to the pounding rhythms of EDM has proven to be the perfect release for a city that has had more than its share of troubles in recent years. "When people come out to party on a Saturday night in Ciudad Juárez, it's different than you and I might experience stateside. The energy is escalated to a whole new level." Weir believes that the venue has encouraged the local population feel more hopeful about the future. "Hardpop has really helped unify and heal Juárez," he concludes. And the DJs who make the trip cannot help but feed off of the positive vibes. "The combination of the sound system, the venue and the crowd is a totally unique experience," says Weir. "And Powersoft is literally at the center of it." \n\nAbout Powersoft: \nPowersoft is the world leader in lightweight, high power, single rack space, energy efficient amplifiers for the professional audio market. Founded in Italy in 1995, headquartered in Florence, Italy, with offices in Ventura, CA, Powersoft couples the experience and precision of its production department with exceptional components to deliver products with perfect audio response and high performance reliability. Its state-of-the-art amplifiers can be found in an array of markets, ranging from stadiums, sporting arenas, theme parks, performance venues and airports to convention centers, churches and clubs, and are used by the world's leading tour sound companies.

0012_51c954ea-d874-4b6c-8aee-8c16a06487dc	Julio Medem ’s filmography includes some of the most distinctive titles of 90s Spanish cinema, but his two features since 2000’s Sex and Lucia -- Chaotic Ana and Room in Rome -- were at best uneven. Ma Ma  maintains the focus on women, but does little to quell the doubts about Medem’s career trajectory. Looking rather like the unveiling of a new, audience-friendly, non-provocative Medem who’s hesitant about whether to follow the market or his muse, Ma Ma features a melodramatically weepie story line; elegant, fashion catalog design; dreams of soccer glory; and Penelope Cruz as a young mother battling breast cancer. \n \nWhat could possibly go wrong? Well, Cruz’s aces performance apart, very little about this extremely disappointing film feels real, and some of it is risible. But presales have been strong, driven presumably by the presence of Cruz, and it’s facile message, expressed more concisely by Eric Idle at the end of Life of Brian , might mean that Ma Ma ’s world of fake emotion could indeed work well for the younger, more impressionable demographic. \n \nIn the opening scenes, unemployed Magda (Cruz, doing her considerable best in a film she co-produced) is diagnosed as having breast cancer, for which she’s being treated by gynecologist Julian ( Asier Etxeandia ), a dreamy, soft-spoken chap with unlimited time available to deal with his patients. In the stands at a soccer game, watching her talented son Dani ( Teo Planell ), she meets soccer scout Arturo ( Luis Tosar ), who receives the news that there’s been a car crash involving his wife and son. \n \nA friendship develops between Magda and Arturo, based on mutual emotional support: Dani’s Raul ( Alex Brendemuhl ) is an implausibly callous philosophy teacher who’s scarcely to be seen. Soon it will fall to Julian to reveal that her cancer is terminal: she starts having mysterious dreams of a pale girl in snow, walking dreamily towards camera. \n \nJulian, meanwhile, is that rare beast, a doctor who sings 70s Spanish pop songs to his patients -- to say the least, an extremely dodgy directorial decision. After the gyno starts warbling over Magda’s bed, Ma Ma never really recovers. It’s a thin line between directorial fearlessness and directorial foolhardiness. \n \nMedem’s early work created distinctive worlds, poetic, eerie and strange. They were driven by their own logic, and bizarre though it sometimes was, they were working in the service of a vision. But here, there is an absence of any comprehensible world or vision, and very little logic. Magda, an unemployed teacher, lives in a great apartment. How come Julian has so much free time? What happens to Dani’s soccer dreams, so crucial at the start? And yes, the continual suggestions that Magda’s illness have isolated her from the world come over loud and clear, but why does she not have even a single female friend? Indeed, a nurse (Silvia Abascal) apart, where are all the women the final credits tell us the film is dedicated to? \n \nWatching Ma Ma is thus an unsettling experience in all sorts of unintended ways. It’s as though Medem, having realized that he’d accidentally written a conventional melodrama, suddenly decided at the shooting stage that he’d have to use style to make it all more interesting. This is clearest when a kiss cuts to medical images of a pulsating heart: and it’s here when the viewer realizes that the director is somewhat questionably using breast cancer as a platform for his art, rather than tackling it with the human sensitivity its subject surely demands. \n \nPerformances are good, but characterization is sketchy. Tosar, one of Spain’s finest and highest-profile character actors, here mostly hangs around weeping or looking glum. If meeting Magda has been some kind of redemption for Arturo, then he’s mostly keeping it to himself: and strangely, these two friends whose lives have been blighted barely openly discuss the elephant in the room. Dani is an off-the-peg son, happy to score winning goals as his proud Mom cheers from the sidelines and ask winning, puzzled questions. \n \nCruz’s best work, as in Pedro Almodovar ’s  Volver and Sergio Castellitto ’s  Don’t Move , has been done in the role of a suffering woman driven by inner dignity. Ma Ma, which offers her something similar, is one of her finest performances, and by some distance she is the strongest thing about it: scatty, forgetful, moody, with a winsome, trusting innocence about her, Magda is a real, rounded woman in an unreal, monodimensional world. It’s the sort of faux philosophical, faux poetic world in which someone muses “We need the sea in summer”, and someone else replies “Yes, if we didn’t, it wouldn’t be summer”. \n \nMa Ma unfolds in varying locations of chilly extraterrestrial paleness, as though it was a melodrama beamed in from Mars. If cancer is a dirty, messy business, physically and emotionally, then very little of it comes over. Beautiful to watch and elegantly designed but remote, there’s the sense that the actors are struggling to give it their gritty, realistic best despite the hyper-stylized setting in which they’ve been placed. Perhaps Medem opted for this stripped-back look to allow the viewers to focus exclusively on the intense emotions at hand, but all it does is distract from them. \n \nThrow in regular, alienating jump-cuts, lovingly-lensed technology, and an occasional close-up of a puzzling symbol -- Magda’s nipple, beautifully preserved on ice as a souvenir, a crab in the sand -- and the viewer's alienation is complete. \n \nProduction companies: Morena Films, Ma Ma Peliculas, Mare Nostrum Productions \nCast: Penelope Cruz, Luis Tosar, Asier Etxeandia, Teo Planell, Silvia Abascal \nDirector, screenwriter: Julio Medem \nProducers: Penelope Cruz, Julio Medem, Alvaro Longoria \nDirector of photography: Kiko de la Rica \nProduction designer: Montse Sanz \nEditors: Julio Medem, Ivan Aledo \nComposer: Alberto Iglesias \nSales: Seville International (Int’l), Creative Artists Agency (US) \n \nPG, 111 minutes

There’s lots of data that NBC looks at when deciding whether to renew or cancel a TV series but the ratings are typically the biggest piece. Here’s how the network’s shows are doing. Note: If you’re not seeing the updated charts, please try reloading the page. You can also see them here and here. A couple of notes about these charts:\nThese figures are updated automatically as new ratings are released. The averages are based on the final national numbers (live plus same day viewing), unless marked with an asterisk (*). For technical reasons, I have to resort them manually so feel free to let me know if I missed something. Keep in mind that the demo numbers are typically what’s most important to advertisers. Therefore, that’s how the networks measure success. Advertisers pay more for ad time on a show that has a higher demo rating. Because older viewers don’t count? No, it’s because younger viewers watch less traditional TV and are harder to reach. Demo numbers are typically reported using the 10ths decimal place (2.4, for example). In the averages, I’m using an extra decimal for easier ranking. The networks take into account when shows air on Fridays and Saturdays, nights when TV viewership is lower. How are your shows doing? Check the other current rankings:\nABC | CBS | The CW | FOX\nABC Family | AMC | FX | HBO | MTV | Showtime | Syfy | TNT | USA What do you think? Which shows are you rooting for? Which one isn’t as big a hit as you thought? Are you hoping any series will get cancelled to make way for something else?
0015_d94ec214-e9d1-45ea-9dad-ad28271eec3e	West Ham have announced the signing of striker Nikica Jelavic from Hull as the Premier League club take their number of deadline day signings to three. \n \nThe 30-year-old has signed an initial two-year deal at Upton Park, where he will link up again with manager Slaven Bilic after playing for the West Ham boss during his time in charge of Croatia. \n \nHe follows Alex Song and Victor Moses, both on season-long loan deals, into West Ham on a busy day for the club having scored one Championship goal for the Tigers this season. \n \nThe former Rangers forward will now be looking to get back into top-flight action having scored eight goals in Hull's relegation from the Premier League last season. \n \nJelavic, who underwent surgery on a long-term knee problem earlier this year, admits the lure of playing under Bilic was part of the attraction in moving to east London. \n \n"I've played for Slaven before for the Croatia national team and he is a great manager and a great man," he told West Ham TV. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"I am really happy and delighted to be working with him and all his staff again.

0017_0a00fbad-9764-4894-ac95-fd53ced8c453	Their relationship isn’t going to the dogs, but Cambridge residents Liz Allen and Jonathan Donaldson hope their wedding reception will. The couple, scheduled to tie the knot Sept. 26 at the Yarmouth New Church on Route 6A, posted an ad on Craigslist asking local owners of bulldogs, pugs or Boston terriers to bring their pets to the outdoor reception immediately after the ceremony. “I didn’t know if anyone would respond,” said Allen. “There’s got to be quite a few people in the area who have—we joke about it—any dog with chops.” The family fascination with jowly breeds began with Donaldson’s son Gus, and quickly spread to daughter Anouk, Donaldson himself, and Allen. “He always liked dogs, but the bulldog obsession started when he was about nine years old,” said Allen. “We just sort of developed this family joke. We have songs we sing about bulldogs.” The couple is hoping to have a lawn filled with dogs to surprise the kids after the wedding. “It’s a little silly, but the wedding is going to be just very casual and fun, with family from all over the country,” said Allen. “I think they’d just love the surprise of, they come out of the church, and there’s just all these bulldogs around.” “It’s the kind of place where any kind of wedding can happen,” said Humberto Cordero, a member of the Yarmouth New Church Preservation Foundation. “It’s a kind of all-takers venue for events of all sorts, because it’s not a church. But it is a church. That’s the wonderful thing about it.” Cordero, a friend of the couple who will also officiate the wedding, suggested the unique building, formerly the home of Yarmouth’s Swedenborgian congregation, now a secular venue for art exhibits, musical performances, and all manner of other events. He said ideas like the couple’s bulldog reception fit well with the New Church’s openness to ceremonies of all kinds. “We take the weird or the very straight,” Cordero said. “It’s a very flexible space. For the people who are looking for a storybook wedding, it’s sort of a storybook part of the Cape. It’s a very unique spot. I don’t think there’s anything like it on the Cape.” Cordero said he hopes people respond to the couple’s invitation. “It’ll be interesting as they come out of the church, as they come down the steps, whether we’re going to have a little doggy party. That would be an interesting way to end the day.” Page 2 of 2 - So far Allen and Donaldson have received one RSVP. Barnstable resident Callalilly Finglas will be in attendance, along with her pug Hugsley. “It sounded like a cute idea, and I always like to try and help out,” said Finglas. “It just seemed like a positive thing to do. I love meeting new people.” Hugsley, too, is gregarious. “She’s social,” said Finglas. “When she’s talking to someone and likes them, she’ll roll over on her back.” The family doesn’t have a dog of its own, but the possibility of receiving one as a wedding present in light of the reception’s theme has occurred to Allen. “We live in a really small place, and we thought about getting one,” she said. “If we got one, we would be thrilled. I don’t quite know how we’d manage it in this space, but we’d make it work.” RSVP The invitation for bulldogs, pugs, and Boston terriers to attend the wedding of Liz Allen and Jonathan Donaldson can be found under the pets section of Cape Cod Craigslist. The ceremony takes place Sept. 26 at the Yarmouth New Church , 266 Route 6A, Yarmouth Port.
0018_14325b24-abdf-4ede-8588-62158096afea	CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Browns took a leap of faith and put Terrelle Pryor on the 53 man roster. \n \nThe 4 p.m deadline for final cuts came and went, and Pryor, who's making the transition from quarterback to receiver, was still standing. \n \nPryor can also serve as the Browns' third quarterback now that they only have Josh McCown and Johnny Manziel on the roster. Backups Thad Lewis and Pat Devlin were among the final cuts. \n \nPryor played quarterback for three seasons in Oakland, including two when current Browns offensive coordinator John DeFilippo was his quarterbacks coach. \n \nTerrance West was not safe heading into the final cuts a source told Northeast Ohio Media Group, but he's still on the team. The Browns engaged in talks with the Cowboys according to Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle, but the Browns were asking to much. \n \nMeanwhile, rookie receiver Vince Mayle, the Browns fourth-round pick out of Washington State, was waived. The Browns will likely try to add him to the practice squad. Mayle struggled in preseason after undergoing thumb surgery in May. He was inconsistent catching the ball and needs time to develop. \n \nRunning back Shaun Draughn was also among the cuts. \n \nCoach Mike Pettine provided some clues that he was leaning toward keeping Pryor after the preseason finale Thursday night in Chicago. That night, Pryor played receiver, quarterback and personal punt protector. \n \n"Anytime you can have a guy that can run, that can throw, that can protect, I just think it changes the mindset defensively a little bit,'' said Pettine, who knows what gives a defense fits. \n \nOn Friday, however, Pettine acknowledged it would be 'a leap of faith' to keep the inexperienced wideout on the team. \n \n"It is a project to take a guy that has played quarterback for the vast majority of his football career,'' said Pettine. "Even if he had stayed completely healthy, I don't know if we would have all the results in or feel 100 percent comfortable. Even if he had gone the whole time and not gotten injured, it certainly it would be a leap of faith." \n \nPryor -- who missed most of camp with a strained hamstring -- didn't have a pass thrown his way that night, but he ran his routes with authority, he proved a tenacious blocker and ran the read-option twice, keeping the ball both times for runs of 5 and 4 yards. When his 15-18 snaps were up, his 4.5-yard rushing average was tops on the team, better than West's 3.9-yard average on his nine carries. \n \n"To be out there competing against different guys and getting my chance to put my hands on different guys -- guys who aren't our teammates -- I had a good time,'' said Pryor. \n \nLewis said of Pryor after the game, "the guy has a knack for football. He's physically gifted, so he has the opportunity to be great. He just has to keep working at it.'' \n \nBefore the game, Pryor stressed that he didn't want anything handed to him. He worked hard at his new craft in the month leading up to camp, training at the Randy Moss Academy in North Carolina with other top receivers. \n \n"I don't want to feel blessed,'' Pryor said. "Everything I've ever done for my life, sheesh, my mother, growing up I've been by myself, moving in and out of different places by myself since I was 12 years old. I really didn't have like a figure, people to show me the way. I've pretty much grown and anything I have I've worked for it by myself. \n \n"I don't like being given anything. I do want to help the Browns. If that's the opportunity I have, cool, but that doesn't excite me. That doesn't say I've worked for it. When I get on the field I'd say I'm a great teammate. I spend a long time in the facility, I always ask questions, I try to be the best teammate, player I can be. But that doesn't excite me because I want to earn everything I have or get.'' \n \nPryor also has no regrets about waiting so long to give up on his quarterback dreams and try receiver. He spent three years as a quarterback in Oakland from 2011-2012 and sat out of football in 2014. \n \n"You can't have regrets and you can't look back,'' he said. "I definitely don't look back in the past because I've been cut three times. This doesn't hurt me mentally. All I can do is look forward and enjoy this time I've been having, having great coaches coach me up every single day, having great teammates right now here in the present. Being a Cleveland Brown, I enjoy it, I love it.'' \n \nPryor was grateful he had earned the respect of cornerbacks Joe Haden and Tramon Williams before going down with the hamstring injury Aug. 4th. \n \n"It means a lot,'' he said. "The feeling for me to have a guy like Joe Haden, Dwayne Bowe and guys like that to speak up for me on my behalf. It doesn't get any better than that. You've got Joe Haden, guys you go against and he kind of sees your potential. I appreciate that from Joe, I really do appreciate him and appreciate all my teammates.'' \n \nHaden, for one,  was confident other teams would've given Pryor a chance at receiver if the Browns had given up on him.  Now, he'll get to go against him in practice every day and help him become an NFL receiver. \n \nOther Browns cut today include receiver Josh Lenz, defensive linemen Jacobbi McDaniel and Dylan Wynn, cornerback Joe Rankin, cornerback Robert Nelson Jr. and offense lineman Andrew McDonald.
0019_f0f25297-98b6-4bb7-9d67-966f64ab3e75	Fans are torn about the possibility of Gloucester Rugby being passed into overseas hands after an Australian consortium offered £20million for the club. \n \nA group of businessmen from Down Under are one of five possible new owners for the Cherry and Whites, who have been up for sale since April. \n \nSerious interest in the club is being shown within England, Europe and Japan. A deal could be concluded within a couple of weeks. \n \nMajor shareholders Ryan Walkinshaw and Martin St Quinton are understood to be looking for at least £25million for the club, which is one of the few professional rugby clubs to turn a profit. \n \nFans were split on whether the club should be foreign-owned. \n \nGary Teague, landlord of Teague’s Bar opposite Kingsholm, said new investment could take Gloucester Rugby to greater things on the field. \n \nHe said: “A cash injection is what the club needs to take it to the next level. A lot of clubs are spending big and the investment could secure our future in the Premiership. We don’t want to end up like Bristol. \n \n“The new owners need to take Gloucester to the Saracens level.” \n \nIvan Taylor, chairman of the Westgate Traders’ Association, earlier this year campaigned for fans to pull together and buy the club. \n \nHe said: “The new ownership needs to secure the ground for the future and not use it as a toy to make profit. \n \n“Hopefully the new owners will have a plan that improves the club and carries on the traditions of Kingsholm. \n \n“If we had 20,000 people wanting to get involved then buying the club could be achievable. We would have to raise £25million, which is no mean feat.” \n \nMr Walkinshaw and Mr St Quinton are not desperate to sell the club and maintain any agreement would be made in the best interests of the club. \n \nBut lifelong Gloucester Rugby fan Chris Collier said he was worried at the prospect of the club being foreign-owned. \n \nHe said: “I’m nervous about the ownership of the club being on the other side of the world. What would they know about the traditions of Gloucester? \n \n“I would prefer a local consortium of businesses to take over. The city is rugby mad and it’s unique.” \n\nGloucester Rugby and its owners will meet with agents of contenders in the next few weeks.
0020_ac9c985a-79d1-40a0-906a-ef4de1240765	Court of Appeal says jury acted "unreasonably" in defamation case against broadcaster Ray Hadley, and parts of the case should be re-tried. \n\nBroadcaster Ray Hadley has won a partial victory in a defamation case brought against him by a Sydney fish and chip shop owner, with the Court of Appeal ordering parts of the case be re-tried and suggesting the original damages payout was "excessive".\n\nAfter a lengthy trial in late 2013, a Supreme Court jury found the 2GB host defamed Kim Ahmed in two broadcasts and rejected his defence of honest opinion.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal - Justices Ruth McColl, John Basten and Anthony Meagher - ruled on Thursday that some of the jury's findings were "unreasonable" and ordered a retrial of part of the case.\n\nThe ruling leaves intact some of the jury's findings but may result in a reduced damages award once the retrial has been heard.\n\nHadley delivered two attacks against Ms Ahmed in 2008 and 2009 for supporting her husband after he was convicted of indecently assaulting a 17-year-old female staff member in the shop's cool room in January 2007.\n\nHe described Ms Ahmed as a "grub" and a "silly, silly woman" and called on listeners to put the couple's shop out of business.\n\nActing Supreme Court Justice Henric Nicholas . But the Court of Appeal said the jury had acted unreasonably in characterising Hadley's statements as fact rather than opinion, which was fatal to his defence of honest opinion.\n\nDuring one of the broadcasts, Hadley took aim at Ms Ahmed for taking out an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against the father of the teenage assault victim for allegedly stalking and intimidating her.\n\nThe broadcast was found to convey that the AVO application was false, vexatious and frivolous.\n\nThe court said the jury's finding that Hadley's remarks about the AVO were "statements of fact and not expressions of opinion was unreasonable and should be set aside".\n\nIt ordered a retrial so a new jury can consider whether Hadley's opinion was based on material that was substantially true, which is one of the requirements of the defence.\n\nThe court found the jury had also mischaracterised a suggestion Ms Ahmed was a "low, contemptible person" as a statement of fact, and it will be considered in the retrial.\n\nIt left the jury's findings about other meanings intact, including that Hadley had no defence to claims Ms Ahmed was "silly woman" and that she "condones and does not object to the criminal conduct of her husband".\n\nBut it noted the trial judge had awarded $40,000 solely in respect of the imputation Ms Ahmed was a "silly woman" and said it was "arguable" this was "excessive".\n\nDamages will be decided by the judge presiding over the retrial. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0021_5074029a-6682-4fc6-94e4-511e97c619a0	Inside his Goulbrun prison cell, convicted shoplifter Beau Wiles, stripped down to just underwear and a cap then somehow took two photos of himself and posted them to Facebook. \n\nInside his Goulburn prison cell, shoplifter Beau Wiles stripped down to his underwear and a cap then somehow took two photos of himself and posted them to Facebook.\n\n"Love u my my (sic) princess," the 25-year-old one-time aspiring rap artist captioned the pictures - a message to his girlfriend waiting on the outside.\n\nShe responded a short time later: "Love u too my prince can't wait to have my hand all ova that sexy body of urz."\n\nLess than 48 hours later, Wiles vanished from the prison grounds, having last been spotted in a work area of the jail at 10am on Wednesday.\n\nWiles' escape, the second from the Goulburn complex in six weeks, has again raised questions about security at the prison.\n\nMore questions are being raised about how Wiles was able to take photographs, make posts to Facebook and communicate with friends online, given internet access is banned for all inmates.\n\nWiles was serving 18 months in minimum security. But his girlfriend revealed on his Facebook page that they had been making wedding plans.\n\n"Thats my man lookin fresh as always ,,, babie i cant wait to marry you!!! As soon as ur out im gunna make u my husband,xxxx," she wrote.\n\nWiles, who recorded a rap song, Time To Rise, under the name BEAUJANGLZ in 2012, also kept his family and friends up to date with what he was doing, and eating, while in jail.\n\n"Just finished in the gym having a tuna and bake beans the good stuff u know it ... " he posted at the start of the month.\n\nOn Wednesday morning police began a search for Wiles, who was described as being 180 centimetres tall, 100 kilograms, with tattoos on his lower forearms.\n\nA Facebook friend urged him to hand himself in to police.\n\n"Brother please hand ur self in to police now its only jail the is bad beau they will kill u shoot u dead please bro go back to police now please I beg u beau," the poster wrote on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWiles' escape follows that last month of armed bandit Stephen Jamieson, 29, who became the first inmate to escape from Goulburn's maximum security section in 19 years.\n\nJamieson used bed sheets he had tied together to scale the prison walls, and, with a pillow strapped to his waist, manouevred over the razor wire to freedom.\n\nHe was on the run for 12 hours before he was recaptured by police following a pursuit in south-west Sydney.\n\nJamieson was already being held in segregation following suspicions he was behind a man-made hole found on prison grounds earlier in August.\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley said it was not good enough that there had been five prison breaks already in 2015-16\n\n"Corrective Services Minister David Elliott is single-handedly solving the overcrowding crisis in NSW prisons by letting inmates stroll out the front gate," Mr Foley said.\n\n"Under Elliott's watch, inmates even have the luxury of bragging about their escape plans on Facebook. It'd be laughable if it wasn't so serious."\n\nIn 2014-15, seven inmates escaped from NSW correctives facilities, the lowest number in at least two decades.\n\nIn 1995-96 there were 179 escapes. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0022_20c239b1-b016-42bd-bd92-a5f44727e878	\n\n \n \n\t \nThat's not how it's done in the NHL anymore. When the Penguins practice Sunday at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, there's more likely to be a lightning strike than a fight. \n\n"œNow they forbid you,"� said Francois Leroux, a giant 6-foot-6 enforcer for the Penguins from 1994-97 who retired from pro hockey in 2008. "œEven toward my last training camps, coaches said, "˜Guys, save it for the other teams.' "� \n\nBut that's how it was done in the NHL for decades. Those who made their living with their fists knew they had to make an impression. \n\n"œYou had to establish yourselves, and there's always someone new on the block who's trying to climb the rope,"� said Dave Hanson, who racked up 2,548 penalty minutes in a 10-year pro career in addition to starring in "œSlap Shot"� as one of the Hanson brothers. "œThey have to establish themselves and set a tone too."� \n\nLess squaring up \n\nThese days, fights are almost as rare in the regular season as they are in training camp scrimmages. \n\nTeams have averaged .38 and .32 fights per game over the past two seasons. That's the first time there have been back-to-back seasons with fewer than .40 fights per team per game since 1968-70. \n\nThe Penguins reflect those changes. \n\nThey had 33 fighting majors last season, tied for third most in the league, but most of the players responsible for those bouts have departed via trade or free agency. The 20 players projected to be in the starting lineup on opening night combined for just four fights in a Penguins jersey last season: one each for Crosby, Kris Letang, Ian Cole and Rob Scuderi. \n\nThere's a chance the Penguins could shake up those stats if agitating winger Bobby Farnham becomes a lineup regular or if heavyweight tryout Tom Sestito sticks, but it's not likely. The Penguins will deal with misbehaving opponents in other ways. \n\nEven assistant coach Rick Tocchet, who had 156 fighting majors in 18 NHL seasons, acknowledges that. \n\n"œWe have a team that's fast. We have a lot of guys that can score,"� Tocchet said. "œThat's a great detriment to people playing a little too aggressive or too chippy with each other."� \n\nMirroring the trend \n\nThere's a perception that it has always been that way in the Penguins organization, that the team has preferred to play a beautiful game and serve its revenge on a power-play platter. \n\nThat's not entirely true. \n\nWhen fighting became fashionable during the 1970s, with expansion diluting the talent pool and the Philadelphia Flyers having championship success with their Broad Street Bullies, the Penguins followed suit with the likes of Battleship Kelly, Steve Durbano and Bryan Watson. \n\nWhen the game took another turn for the rough and tumble in the 1980s, the Penguins again kept pace. Led by Paul Baxter, Gary Rissling and Marty McSorley, they exceeded the league average in fights per game for three straight seasons from 1981-84. \n\nFive years ago, aided by a pair of brawls with the New York Islanders, the Penguins had nearly double the league average of fights per game. \n\nIn other words, from Dave "œThe Hammer"� Schultz to Georges Laraque, Penguins history is littered with colorful characters who knew how to fight. \n\n"œEven when Mario (Lemieux) was there, there were some pretty tough cookies there,"� Hanson said. "œYou had (Kevin Stevens). You had Tocchet. They were a tough team."� \n\nThey still may be a tough team, but the definition of toughness has changed. Now it might be about taking a hit to make a play or persevering through bumps and bruises to stay in the lineup. \n\nThe days of players proving their toughness through fistfights "” whether against teammates in training camp scrimmages or opponents in games that count "” look to be numbered. \n\n"œThe game's changing. A lot of people like to say, "˜It would be better like this or it would be better like that,' but it's changing.

0023_3381e84b-3ba0-4283-81b7-93a39883af2e	Sergeant Amy Mills is busy. Not so busy that she can’t spare some time to talk about the job that she loves, but her brisk gait and purposeful demeanor are an instant giveaway that she’s a woman on a mission. And that mission—to resolve the backlog of rape kits in Dallas—is a job so monumental that most of us wouldn’t even know where to begin. But despite the obvious magnitude of the project, the Dallas Police Department Sex Assault Unit, under Mills’ leadership, has submitted 2,356 kits for laboratory testing since last August. This is a significant dent in a logjam that consists of 4,140 sets of evidence, all of which had been gathering dust in DPD’s property room until late last year. \n\nThose 4,140 kits represent much more than the evidence inside them: they represent lives in limbo. Assembling them requires re-traumatizing sexual assault victims, who have to undergo an intensive examination by a nurse certified in evidence retrieval. Once medically stabilized, victims spend somewhere in the neighborhood of an hour under harsh lights being probed and swabbed and plucked and photographed in a process that is demeaning and painful. Sergeant Mills is adamant that this process should never be in vain. “If you endure that invasive exam when all you want to do is take a shower, brush your teeth—take a drink of water, even…then we owe it to you to process that evidence, to be an advocate for you, and to let you have some sense of closure.” \n\nMills makes it clear that the backlogged kits didn’t stay untested due to negligence or lack of regard toward crime victims. In fact, DPD is one of the few departments that keeps evidence past the statute of limitations—the property room actually has rape kits that date back 30 years. But for a variety of reasons, too large a number remained untouched. Sometimes, the survivors weren’t willing or able to participate in investigations. Funding and personnel limitations were often a factor. And, Mills says, investigators have only recently begun to understand the full evidentiary value of the kits. Obviously, justice for the victim of the assault is a driving factor, but there’s an element of prevention to be pursued, also. Sexual assault perpetrators are rarely one-time offenders. Mills details burglary cases, domestic assaults, sex offenses, even murders that were solved by evidence obtained from a single rape kit. “We’re finding out how intertwined these crimes are,” she says, “It’s amazing how one victim’s evidence can link us to so many other investigative leads.” \n\nThe rape kit issue became a national one when an assistant prosecutor in Detroit, Kym Worthy, brought to light that over 11,000 kits had been untested in that jurisdiction; a number of advocacy organizations took notice and began to raise funds to end that backlog and others across the nation. As a result of the increased attention, a grant was made through the Texas Department of Public Safety to fund Dallas PD’s efforts to test the cases—at approximately $500 a piece. The money will allow testing back to 1996, and Mills is hopeful she can eventually go back further. \n\nWhen the 15-year DPD veteran is told that she’s being included in a list of Dallas’ most brilliant women, Mills demurs. “I just do the work,” she insists. “There’s nothing special about that.” It’s an understatement that she’s done the work—an impressive juggling act involving most nights and weekends between August of 2014 and April of this year. She still had her regular duties as supervisor of seven detectives in the sex assault unit to attend to, so she’d come in at 6 a.m. and tackle a case or two, then stay late and plow through as many as she could. Each case is painstaking to review: files are examined thoroughly to determine if the associated evidence is eligible for testing, and if so, they are flagged and categorized so that the lab knows what to look for. In an eight -month period, she determined that over 2,000 of the kits were eligible for submission, amassing untold hours of overtime (“No idea,” she says when asked how much time she logged), occupying her mind during her early morning runs, and waking her up at night. \n\nAt this point, her hard work is having a tangible effect. The tests are coming back from the lab; DNA profiles have been entered in CODIS, the FBI’s national database; and so far over 30 percent have resulted in a match. When those matches occur, Mills triages the cases: some are just confirmations of a case that’s already been adjudicated, so no action is required. Others identify a known suspect who is capable of committing further assaults: Mills puts one of her seven detectives on those cases immediately. She’s confident that retesting that mountain of cases results in prevention of further assaults, particularly when she’s able to affect an arrest. And she also loves being able to call a survivor and tell them that it’s over—that she or he can have peace of mind knowing their assailant can’t do this again. \n\nBeyond arrests and overtime, Mills offers something else to the citizens of Dallas, particularly the women and men victimized by a sexual assault: her efforts and her advocacy change the dialogue about rape. She—and her detectives, who she’s quick to credit for their hard work juggling this project alongside their current cases—make it clear that what has happened to these people matters, regardless of whether the victims are college students or prostitutes; drug addicts or professionals. “People understand that they are not forgotten; that they didn’t endure this for nothing. Ultimately, I think this means that more people will report these types of crimes because they know that we believe them. They know now that we want to give them peace of mind and to do everything we can. Hopefully that means they trust us to help them. I’m just sorry it took so long to get to this point.” \n\nMills’ ultimate goal is to zero out that backlog, though it’s a time-consuming and expensive process. It takes six months to process each kit, she says, adding that she’s got a couple she’d really like to expedite through the lab in order to get a particular offender off the streets. Expediting, she explains, costs extra. Her eyes gleam with a particular resolve, and she blazes out of the DPD media relations office on yet another mission: to send an email requesting those funds. You get the feeling that she’ll get them.  \n\n10 Brilliant Dallas Women:  \nDr. Rose Brock, Educator and Literary Advocate \nAnne Marie Weiss, International Community Builder \nKaleta Doolin Promotes Equality with Philanthropy and Art

"I know what my parents would be saying if they were alive now," he added.  "The problem is it's on a different scale, it was a few hundred people but what do you do when there's hundreds of thousands?" \n\nSir David was interviewed by Kirsty Young as part of the opening-night gala before he became the first inductee to the Radio Times's Hall of Fame. \n\nHe blasted the proposed BBC reforms and said the "character and kind of programmes it makes are dependant on the licence fees". \n\nWhen asked about his world-wide fame Sir David was modest and insisted he is part of a team and it is the content that makes his documentaries so popular. \n\n"I'm unbelievably lucky because I've spent my life looking at all these fabulous things," he added. \n\n"The reason the programmes are popular is because those things are fabulous and beautiful, they're what the programmes are about, not me. \n\n"I get a lot of reflected glory and I'm grateful for it but I know where the credit lies." \n\nHe said the main problem facing humanity is global warming and urged David Cameron to invest in green energy.  "It would be wonderful to think that those things I have seen will still be there for the next generation." \n\nThe event, a weekend-long celebration of TV and radio at Hampton Court Palace, will also feature Sir Bruce Forsyth, David Walliams, Doctor Who, The Great British Bake Off, The Archers, Call the Midwife, Poldark, Gogglebox and Shaun the Sheep. \n\nBen Preston, editor of the Radio Times, introduced Sir David to the stage as "the best person alive". \n\n"He is a man who epitomises quality television itself," he added.

0027_f7230353-a117-4537-b462-4302cc4323fc	(CNN) -  \nA solo Japanese climber is expected to start the arduous trek to Camp II on Mount Everest, which at 21,000 feet (6,400 meters) will present a massive challenge to a man whose fingers were amputated to the first joint during a previous attempt to scale the world's highest mountain. \n \nNobukazu Kuriki will be the first and only climber attempting to summit Everest this season, nearly five months after dozens died in an avalanche, the mountain's deadliest accident to date. \n\nWhile the fall climbing season is a tough enough time to attempt to scale the world's highest mountain, the 33-year old is climbing alone and without oxygen. \n\nMajor handicap \n\nKuriki's hands were seriously damaged by frostbite during his 2012 attempt on Everest's West Ridge. He can use his right thumb for grip but isn't able to fully use an ice ax -- a critical part of a mountaineer's safety equipment. \n\n"I was told by a doctor that my performance will drop by more than 20%," Kuriki told CNN earlier this month. \n\n"I feel that it takes more time to do detailed work such as getting change from a vending machine. I lost my fingers but at the same time I learned a lot about life and many people supported me." \n\nKuriki has been acclimatizing at Base Camp since September 7 -- a mere 17,700 feet (5,400 meters) up the mountain. \n\nHe was expected to set off for Camp II at 5 a.m. local time on Wednesday, reaching his destination before nightfall, according to Sachiko Kobayashi, Kuriki's secretary, based in Tokyo. \n\nBut the weather has been poor, with snowfall reported since Saturday -- though the conditions are expected to improve on Thursday, she said. However, Kuriki has not been in touch since 11 p.m. local time on Tuesday, she added. \n\nFifth attempt \n\nKuriki is no stranger to Everest's extreme conditions, from both the Chinese and Nepalese sides of the mountain. \n\nHis September solo quest will be the Hokkaido climber's fifth attempt to summit the mountain. \n\nIn 2009, Chinese officials ordered him off the mountain before he could complete his climbing schedule. \n\nBad weather and a fatal accident with his crew ended a 2010 attempt from the Nepalese side of the mountain. \n\nOn a subsequent try in 2011, his tent poles, supplies and cooking gas were dug up by Himalayan crows at his final camp, and in 2012, extreme cold and high winds ended his quest and left him with serious frostbite. \n\nOdds stacked against success \n\nAlthough he's successfully summited a number of 8,000-meter peaks in Nepal, including Cho Oyu, Manaslu, Dhaulagiri, and Mount Broad Peak, the odds of him successfully conquering Everest at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet), aren't great. \n\nMore than 10,000 climbers have tackled it since mountaineers began their assault on the massif in 1922, but it wasn't until 1953 that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay conquered the mountain. \n\nSince then, more and more climbers have challenged Everest. One in 10 people who attempt it die. \n\nThe risks don't lessen when climbers head for home either. Avalanches, falls, high winds, extreme cold, fatigue and altitude sickness are as much of an issue on the descent. \n\nAdded risk \n\nMost climbers use oxygen to combat the effects of the notorious death zone -- above 8,000 meters -- where the oxygen level in the air is so low, it can't sustain human life. \n\nKuriki, who likes the challenge of winter climbing, will climb without oxygen, increasing his risks significantly. Without supplementary oxygen, climbers battle fatigue and confusion which can lead to accidents. \n\nKuriki has also decided to climb without the support of fellow climbers. He'll climb alone above Everest Base Camp while a cameraman and a Sherpa will climb separately to Camp 2 to record his climb.

0029_da9aacf0-00be-4818-9e62-d2dc448e5919	(CNN) -  \nPope Francis will speak directly to Americans for the first time Wednesday as thousands of people gather in the shadow of the Washington Monument for a glimpse of the man whose humility and love for the poor has electrified the global Catholic Church. \n \nPresident Barack Obama will deploy the full pageantry of the White House to officially welcome Francis, who at the age of 78 is making his debut visit to a nation pulsing with the market capitalism and rampant consumerism he often decries. \n\nAfter speeches from the president and the pope, the two men will hold private talks, with only a translator present, in the Oval Office. Officials will not disclose what they will discuss, but issues such as the U.S. opening to Cuba that Francis helped broker, immigration, economic inequality and climate change could come up. \n\nThen, as an intense security operation swings into action, Francis will climb aboard his Popemobile and slowly navigate a route through the ceremonial plaza south of the White House known as the Ellipse and onto the National Mall. \n\nHuge crowds are expected to greet Francis, whose frequent shows of charity to the needy and Spartan Jesuit lifestyle have helped reinvigorate the image of the church after an era of abuse scandals thinned congregations. \n\nThe pope's speech will be closely watched for how far he strays onto perilous political ground on issues such as the treatment of undocumented migrants, abortion, global warming and the plight of those left destitute by capitalism's excesses. \n\nAmerican Catholics also are waiting to see whether the Spanish-speaking Pope goes off script -- as he sometimes does to speak candidly -- or whether his lack of fluency in English will mean he is less spontaneous than usual. \n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats, feuding in the early exchanges of the 2016 presidential race, will find plenty to chew over in his remarks. \n\nBut as he flew to the United States from Cuba on Tuesday, Francis told reporters he was not a politician and rejected the idea that he was a socialist, or a "lefty" following complaints by some conservatives he has embraced too many progressive causes. \n\nOn his plane on the way to Washington , the pope admitted he "may have given the impression of being a little more to the left, but it would not be a correct interpretation." \n\n"My doctrine ... this is the social doctrine of the Church. Nothing more, nothing less," he said. \n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest, meanwhile, said that Obama had no intention of using his talks with Francis to advance a political agenda, but did argue that the two leaders share common political and economic values. \n\n"This is a president who has been animated even before he started running for public office by the idea that we need to fight for social and economic justice both in this country and around the world," Earnest told CNN. "This has been a hallmark of Pope Francis even before he arrived in the Vatican." \n\nFrancis will later preside over the canonization of 18th-century Spanish priest Junipero Serra at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. \n\nOn Thursday, in the most political moment of his trip, the pope will address a joint meeting of Congress. Later in the week, he heads to New York where he will address the United Nations before ending his six-day stay in the United States in Philadelphia on Sunday.
0030_36b9a54c-8e3d-43bd-a175-d8a30093a625	There's the old saying that goes, "You can't know where you're going if you don't know where you've been." I think Jesus said that. There's also a slightly less older saying that goes, "Well, we know where we're goin', but we don't know where we've been." That was David Byrne of the Talking Heads. I'm not mentally equipped to tell you which proverb is correct, but there's something important to be reflected upon in each. If you are truly clueless about the past, get ready for some blunders upon your path. (U.S. foreign policy shout out!) However, if you spend too much time wondering about the past you may remove yourself too much from the present and miss out on now. Is there some sort of middle path? A way to honor and acknowledge the past, yet be committed and bound to the future? Let's hope so. \n \nThe North Coast Journal is celebrating 25 years in existence, and as someone who has been writing for them 25 years less than that, I find that previous fact rather interesting. No one would have guessed that 25 years later this alt-weekly would be publishing not only a print edition, but a digital online companion as well. The music industry was more or less the same 25 years ago as well. When Byrne released his first solo album after leaving the Heads a little more than 25 years ago, even he probably couldn't imagine the future of the music industry shifting away from one that was almost exclusively based on physical units. \n \nAs musicians nowadays are cruelly aware, putting out a (good) album won't cut it as it did in the past. With CD sales in freefall, musicians need to not only get their albums up online, but also need to spend inordinate amounts of time on Facebook, Twitter, ReverbNation, Flickr, Grindr, Instagram and other horribly named social media platforms just to make enough to buy new guitar strings. Want to write a new song? Well your time is probably better spent hashtaggin' some cat video on Facebook to increase "engagement" with your fans, or crafting a retro looking music video to put on YouTube. The public wants more from bands today and for way less. Is that good or bad? Maybe it's neither, and just the way it is. We can't get too hung up on how things used to be, but just hope we're in the mix when things start becoming what they will be. With that in mind, and barely understood, it's no surprise that many bands these days are incorporating echoes of their heroes and sonic influences, or just covering them outright. Know where you've been? No idea where you're going? Me too. \n Thursday  \nIn an ode to the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (released 44 years ago), Primus (formed 31 years ago) is touring to support its musical interpretation of said musical soundtrack. I've never thought about it before now, but if I had to imagine what Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka's inner monologue sounded like in 2015, it would probably sound a lot like Primus. Les Claypool probably would have made a damn good Wonka as well in the more recent release of the film (sorry, Johnny Depp). Anyway, catch Primus and the Chocolate Factory at the Eureka Muni tonight at 8 p.m. for $37.50. \n \nIf that's a little too rich for your taste, and going back one decade too far, head over to the Jam (what we have always called what used to be called the Jambalaya) for '80s Night with DJ Red . In terms of '80s dollars, adjusted for inflation, it's still free and starts at 9:30 p.m. \n Friday  \nSo-Cal retro rockers the Growlers will be performing for mostly HSU students tonight at the Van Duzer Theater on campus. With a kind of low-fi-psychedelic-'60s-surf-garage-rock sound, the Growlers are true to their So-Cal roots, sounding like a sunny L.A. band with choreographed, hip dance moves made for Top of the Pops , but with a bleaker lyrical content a la Laurel Canyon in the '70s post-cocaine-takeover. Their music video for "Chinese Fountain" — lamenting where technology has taken us — is all '70s mustaches and sideburns located somewhere around Grauman's Chinese Theater. The show's already sold out but maybe you'll find a way in around 10 p.m. Throw a quarter in the fountain kids, and make a wish. \n \nAt 9:30 p.m. you can catch the Sean Hayes Trio at Humboldt Brews. A 23 year native of San Francisco (I think), Mr. Hayes has a voice that sounds similar to Brett Dennen at points. To be fair, as Dennen is younger, it should be noted that Dennen's voice sounds a bit like Sean Hayes. $20 at the door for this show. \n \nHumboldt's premier Talking Heads tribute band, Naive Melodies , is at the Jam(balaya) at 10 p.m. My own kids were dancing it out pretty hard to "Once in a Lifetime" the other night, which would have made David Byrne proud. Bring your own lamp and dance the night away. Not sure what the price is, but it'll be worth it. \n Saturday  \nSpeaking of looking to the past for musical inspiration, Wake the Dead doesn't just go back to the Grateful Dead's catalogue for its sound, it goes all the way back to Celtic music. Always wanted to hear "Brokedown Palace" as if it were sung in a Cork County pub? This is your band. An 8 p.m. showtime at the Arcata Playhouse and $15 will get you in the door. \n \nHumboldt Brews has Soul Night tonight and for just $5 you can sweat and shake your booty at 9 p.m. \n \nThe Jam hosts hip-hop with Little Kidd Lost joined by recent album-releasers Object Heavy at 10 p.m. Price TBA. \n Sunday  \nThe Arcata Playhouse sees the return of Front Country which has one-sixth of its roots here in Humboldt County. A talented ensemble winning many awards for its ... well, talentedness. Catch 'em for $15 at 8 p.m. \n Monday  \nFor a sound hearkening back to gay Paris, when accordions were king and baguette makers didn't take the summers off, look no further than Musette Explosion . If you don't really know what that charming, lilting sound of French accordion music sounds like, but you want your friends to think you do, put Musette Explosion next to your Amelie soundtrack. They'll be at the Playhouse at 8 p.m. and $15 will put you in a great mood. \n \nFull show listings in the Journal 's Music and More grid, the Eight Days a Week calendar and online.

0031_fe8afe4b-e542-4f70-aeb3-91b03ba5c80a	GENEVA, Switzerland - Today, 3 September 2015, WHO declares Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission in the human population.\n\n\nread more \nGENEVA, Switzerland - Today, 3 September 2015, WHO declares Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission in the human population. Forty-two days have passed since the second negative test on 22 July 2015 of the last laboratory-confirmed case. Liberia now enters a 90-day period of heightened surveillance. \n\nLiberia's ability to effectively respond to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease is due to intensified vigilance and rapid response by the government and multiple partners. Transmission had been declared over previously on 9 May 2015, but the disease re-emerged on 29 June and 6 additional cases were identified. \n\nOn 29 June 2015, midway through the first 90-day period, a routine post-mortem swab taken from a 17-year old male, who died on 28 June, tested positive for Ebola virus disease. Upon confirmation of this positive case, a specialized team was immediately dispatched and undertook a detailed investigation. \n\nUnder the leadership of the Liberia Government authorities, an effective response was rapidly initiated to contain the new outbreak. Members of the community were engaged and effectively contributed to contact tracing and social mobilization. International partners supported the government in areas such as technical assistance, provision of personnel,…
0032_3b69b8c0-32ae-4a7b-9403-4346b8c9ad75	Versatility is a good thing at a lot of positions, especially when it can be used to find a matchup advantage or fill a key need. The offensive line really isn't one of them. At least, not game after game after game. Penn State likes the fact that it has a few players that can play center, guard, or tackle at any point in any given game. It trains its linemen to be able to do that, and it helps when injuries occur. But any program, the Lions included, would prefer to keep a set five at the same positions for a full game. Head coach James Franklin and his program, due to injuries and poor play, haven't been able to do that much over their first 15 games in State College. They made a adjustment for skill reasons at the start of Saturday's game versus Buffalo by moving Andrew Nelson from right to left tackle, Brendan Mahon from left guard to right tackle, and then inserted Derek Dowrey, who played as a reserve a week earlier against Temple, as the starting left guard. Then, when Nelson got hurt at halftime, the program brought Week 1 starter Paris Palmer back in to play left tackle, and kept everything else the same. It's not clear if Nelson will play this week, and it was interesting that the program didn't move starting center Angelo Mangiro, who played tackle in 2014, out to that spot. Franklin said Tuesday that part of the reason was because of Mangiro's calming presence in the middle, but if reserve interior lineman Wendy Laurent is more of a full-go this week, the Lions' senior center could seemingly be moved elsewhere. More: Penn State injury update, a look at the punting issues, and more : James Franklin news conference takeaway "We didn't have Wendy completely available the last couple of weeks," Franklin said. "That factored into it. I think the other thing is you could make the argument that your tackles are very important to what you're doing, but your center is the QB of the offensive line, and Angelo has a calming effect to the whole group. "He's able to lead and be a real vocal presence. I think that's the biggest thing, have the one senior be at center." Mahon has played tackle before, too, which was another reason the program felt comfortable making that switch. He's listed at right tackle again for Saturday's game with Rutgers, and Dowrey is listed at left guard with Nelson slotted at left tackle. If the Hershey High native doesn't play, though, shuffling will again have to take place. For his part, Mangiro embraces his role as the leader and calming presence along the Lions' line, no matter where he lines up. Flounders: Penn State's Jason Cabinda's 'a man' in the middle, Troy Reeder coming on strong, per James Franklin "I think that's part of my role on the team, being that senior that's kind of been through some things," he said Tuesday. "That's just my role, to keep guys positive and tell them to move on to the next play and things like that." Penn State's offensive line, which allowed quarterback Christian Hackenberg to be hit just twice on 67 snaps against Buffalo per Franklin, won't have to face talented Rutgers' tackle Darius Hamilton this week, as he's already been ruled out. The Scarlet Knights have five sacks in two game, and like last year, are expected to dial up plenty of pressure to get after the Lions' offense. It means the offensive line, no matter what combination it starts and subsequently uses throughout the game, must be ready. A healthy Nelson and a ready to play Laurent will help. Penn State's mission vs. Rutgers: Don't give dangerous Janarion Grant any room to roam Being able to use a consistent five would be of great benefit, too.

Unbeknownst to Plies (he says), the little girl featured in the video turned out to be Young Thug’s daughter. \n \nThug in turn made a post of his own urging fans to tell the Florida-based rapper to take the video down but not before also threatening Plies and insinuating that if he didn’t take the video down by the end of the day there would be a heavy price to pay. \n \nPlies then responded to Thug’s threat with another post of his own stating, “Ion Disrespect Nobody Children.” before reiterating that he merely posted the clip to emphasize exactly how tired he was. Later on in the post he responds directly to Thug’s threat to him by saying, “If you had a problem with it, f–k n—a, you ask me to take it down. You don’t threaten me to do nothing, p—y n—a.” \n \nIt appears Plies may be awaiting an apology or a more civilized request from Thug regarding the matter because the post in question currently remains on Plies’ account . \n \nCheck out a screenshot of the original post below.
0034_f69ff4d5-ebaf-4c85-a3c1-4f185887e57c	Pressing questions are always asked about my prime-time viewing: \nMy wife: “What network is ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ on?” I didn’t answer. Instead, I asked: “What\nbroadcast network did ‘The Mindy Project” air on?” She said: “NBC!”   \n\nIt’s a confusing media world for sure. \n\n“Mindy” was on Fox; now\nat Hulu; “Nine-Nine” is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what\nnetwork it’s on? Branding, schmanding! \n\nOn the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food\nand Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. \n\nOver the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the\nsports network-- but on CNBC, NBC’s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I’m “cycling” in and out of stock investments in my\nportfolio. \n\nSeeing content in places you don’t expect? Not a trend. \n\nStill, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover.\nTurner airs plenty of NCAA Men’s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV “Video Music Awards” this year on many more of its cable networks. \n\nMuch of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. \n\nSo with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV\nviewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like “Supergirl” and “The Muppets”? (“Supergirl” will be on CBS; “The Muppets,” ABC”). \n\nYes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. \n\nYet in the future, established TV network brands might want\nto be a lot of more than they are.
0035_c2ceda4a-eddb-4fbd-90f4-ec747c8f7b2f	The fireplace has been running a tad inefficiently, oh, ok, then it has started to smoke a bit recently. Getting a sweep in is always a bit problematic due to the shape of the roof and the fact that some of the locals are fraidy-cats when it comes to heights...\n\n\n\nDue to the H-cap on top, they really need to get up top and take this off. casting around for alternative ideas, I stumbled across this: the Gardus Inc RCH205 Sooteater Rotary Chimney Cleaning System.  Normally the cost of shipping large items from the is a major reason for not ordering something like this but I couldn't find anything even close anywhere closer and the shipped price wasn't much more that the price of conventional hand brushes bought locally. Because the flue is so long, I thought it was also a good idea to invest in a set of extension poles.\n\nDelivery down under only took five days, something of a record I think, especially since that involved rural delivery as well. Even though they arrived two weeks ago, I've had to wait for a nice day off to try them out.\n\n\n\nLess the drill this is what you get: six poles = two more in the extension set, the rorating head, comprehensive instructions in English and French; and a sheet of clear plastic to cover the mouth of the fireplace to keep the dislodged soot in.\n\n\n\nThere's also an adaptor that connects the poles to any common hand drill; and a hand tool for depressing the detent on each pole to release it from its mate and allow the assembled poles to be broken down. There are no Allen key-ed parts so the Allen key on the not-pointy end is a bonus.\nAssembly and preparation was easy, taking only a few minutes: the lines on the rotating head had to be trimmed to fit the diameter of the flue - a handy cutting guide is provided...\n\n....and the poles had to be assembled. This is a simple clip system but I had to make two sets as I didn't have room in front of the fire place to lay the whole length out.\n\nI didn't use the plastic sheet but placed drop cloths over the couches just in case things got messy. As it happened I needed have bothered. The whole process was pretty painless. I had the garage vac running in the fire box - while it didn't pick up a lot of the debris as it fell, it was great and sucking up the dust and keeping that bfrom floeing into the lounge.\n .   \n\nUse was easy - don't know why I was worried about this.\n\n\n\nHooked the drill up to the first length, guided the cleaning head into the chimney and away we went. After working the heading up and down a couple of times, I added in the next length of four poles and up we went, all the way to the top. As expected the greater amount oif debris came from above the roof line we I suspect the colder air and metal has been encouraging the smoke to scale against the insides of the flue - certainly the second half resulted a lot more debris coming down.\n\nThe shaft spun easily in my hands and runs up and down the flue with no problems or stoppages. Once the the flow of sooty debris ceased, I reversed the process and brought the shaft out by sections. It had cleaned out a lot of soot and scale, enough to fill a vacuum bag, maybe 2-3 kilograms. The only question is whether there are any obstructions in the H itself - hope not as otherwise we will be needing to get someone in as this is not a roof to be casually scaled - the test of that will be tonight. If the H is part of the problem, it'll be replaced with a conventional straight through cap so the shaft can push all the way out the top. The set all broken down -  took less than five minutes - and ready to go away. Clean up inside only took another five minutes or so.\n\nI don't know why a tool like this is not readily available here as it is a quick and simple way of performing a dirty task that also keeps homes safe by reducing the risk of chimney fire; and contributes to home health by enabling fires to burn warmer and more efficiently.

0037_97b8156a-4903-441c-a50d-1a2f75ec2831	It seems like only yesterday Made in Chelsea swapped the plush comforts of SW3 for the fast-paced streets of LA, yet we’ve finally had to wave goodbye to our favourite reality TV show as we watched the finale of Made in Chelsea: LA. \n  \nAs if it's the series finale already, why you gotta leave so soon #MiCLA !? \n \n— Simone (@SimoneLMartin) September 14, 2015 \n \nIt’s been a turbulent summer for the gang Stateside – Jamie’s managed to stir up romantic conflict (unsurprisingly), JP stamped all over Binky’s heart after leading her on for months, Louise shocked us all with the possibility of shacking up with Alik in New York and Mark-Francis is, well, as fabulous as ever. \n \nHere are eight very important things that happened in the final of Made in Chelsea: LA. \n \n1. Jamie now wants to be in a relationship. \n \nWhile at a sophisticated brunch with Lucy and Alex, Jamie reveals that he’s actually yearning for a relationship, now ready to commit, and wants to confess his love to Jess. \n \n“I think that’s really dumb,” Lucy said. \n \n“You both played so many games it’s so tiring.” \n  \nI'm pretty sure that Jamie is incapable of being in a relationship #MiCLA \n   Promoted stories   \n— Manda (@amandabeech) September 14, 2015 \n \nNevertheless the serial-dater hatched an elaborate plan to get Jess all by herself to declare his undying feelings to her, but somehow we don’t think Jamie will get the fairytale ending he’s hoping for. \n \n2. Ollie’s back! \n \nAfter enduring a brutal rejection from JP in last week’s episode, Binky jetted straight back to SW3 to seek comfort from a familiar face… Ollie Locke. \n  \nAhhh Ollie you've been missed ❤️ #MiCLA \n \n— Raj (@Rajjohal7) September 14, 2015 \n \nWhile confiding to an old friend, Binky revealed some rather shocking news – just two days before she received the boot from JP in LA, the two had had sex. \n \nBefore Ollie could shower Binks with consoling words, he just had to ask the question we were all wondering… \n  \nStandard question 'Was he good?' #MiCLA \n \n— Charlotte Cope (@cope_charlotte) September 14, 2015 \n \n3. Lucy and James are the cutest. \n \nThey’ve been our favourite from the moment they laid eyes on each other and, having proved there is at least one happy couple in Chelsea, we couldn’t love Lucy and James more. \n  \nJames and Lucy are easily my favourite couple ever. #MadeInChelsea  #MiCLA \n \n— Paula (@PaulaBrooksx) September 14, 2015 \n  \nLucy and James are my favourite couple #MiCLA \n \n— • (@Ollyowe) September 14, 2015 \n  \nOn a mission to find the James to my Lucy..  #MiCLA \n \n— Laura Baker (@lbakes) September 14, 2015 \n \n4. Jamie and Naz finally patched things up. \n \nAfter taking her on some pretty amazing dates and only to then, erm, get with Jess behind her back, Jamie finally took the time to explain his behaviour to Naz. \n \nSomewhere amidst admitting he had acted selfishly and that he had still have feelings for Jess, Jamie did what we would never have expected in a million years and apologised. \n  \nWas that Jamie… being mature? And… admitting that he was wrong? Christ. #MiCLA \n \n— Rebecca Taylor (@rjtaylor90) September 14, 2015 \n \nHas Jamie grown up once and for all?! \n \n5. Who knew Alex would be the voice of reason? \n \nWhen Alik let slip JP and Binky had been secretly hooking up, there was one person who wasn’t too happy to hear the news… Alex. \n  \nIf ALEX of all people thinks you're out of order JP, then you really are out of order! #MICLA \n \n— Carla Scudder (@CarlaScudder) September 14, 2015 \n \nAlex, the man who had himself cheated on Binky numerous times, bizarrely jumped to his ex’s defence, berating JP for his behaviour, and everyone seemed to love his new-found outlook on life. \n  \nIt's wrong that I actually like Alex now. #MiCLA \n \n— Lianne (@Lianne2024) September 14, 2015 \n  \nOhhhh Alex got a smidge of respect from me there  #MiCLA \n \n— Lindsay H Coombes (@Linlou1982) September 14, 2015 \n  \nCan I just say Alex has been amazing this series! Love him again. Calling JP out makes him doubly amazing #MiCLA \n \n— Seyi (@ruiningf0otball) September 14, 2015 \n \n6. We all need a friend like Louise in our lives. \n \nIf there’s one person who hasn’t taken too well to this Binky/JP fiasco (besides the couple themselves) it’s little Louise, and she sure didn’t hold back in the season’s finale. \n  \nYou may not like the way Louis's spoke to JP but she only said the truth! JP has been an arse #MiCLA \n \n— Roisin (@RoRoSuperRo) September 14, 2015 \n \n“You seem to be having a lot of fun,” Louise said to JP, while the gang were at a Malibu beach party. \n \n“I’ve heard you’ve been messaging a lot of girls and keeping your options open.” \n \nUh oh. \n \nJP, being the honest soul that he is, denied ever have messaging a single female while he was with Binky but Louise, being as relentless as she is, soon drove him into a corner… \n  \nLouise knows how to interrogate! I love it sticking up for her bestie! #MiCLA \n \n— Daria Morgendorffer (@ItsSho) September 14, 2015 \n \nThe rumours were found to be true as JP finally admitted he had been chatting to other ladies while with Binks – but swore he stopped once the two became “serious”. \n \n“I think the whole thing is so destructive, just leave her alone. And I never want to fucking speak to you about it again,” Louise shot back, storming off in true Made in Chelsea style. \n  \nI seriously need a friend like Louise in my life, her loyalty to Binky is amazing #MiCLA \n \n— charlotte (@chxrlotteprice) September 14, 2015 \n  \nI love Louise! Totally has her girls back ✋ #MiCLA \n \n— sophie spencer (@SophieSpencerx) September 14, 2015 \n  \nI love @LouiseAThompson so much ❤️❤️❤ you go girl #MiCLA \n \n— Erin (@eringarvie1) September 14, 2015 \n \n7. It’s about time Jamie got his heart broken – but our hearts are breaking too. \n \nThe whole episode was gearing up to the moment Jamie confessed all to an unsuspecting Jess, and while us at home knew Jess didn’t reciprocate his feelings of love, Jamie was none the wiser. \n \n“I want you, and know I could give you the world,” he told Jess, only to be interrupted mid-sentence. \n \n“Stop! I’m not ready, I don’t want to lose you as a friend, I don’t want to be in a relationship with you. I love you, but I’m not in love with you,” Jess said, teary-eyed. \n  \nJamie and Jess would have been such a cute couple #MiCLA \n \n— Amyealham (@amyealham_) September 14, 2015 \n \nWhile we have to admit, we did feel a slight sense of satisfaction seeing Jamie being played at his own game, we couldn’t help but feel for the dude who genuinely looked like his whole world had just fallen apart in front of his eyes. \n  \nCompletely broken-hearted after watching that Jess and Jamie chat  #MiCLA \n \n— Bella.  (@isabellaholly) September 14, 2015 \n  \nJess and Jamie break my heart in every way possible #MiCLA \n \n— georgia • (@GeorgiaSBrown) September 14, 2015 \n  \nI wish Jess would just give it a go with Jamie already, clearly perfect for each other! :( #MiCLA \n \n— Australopithecus (@HopeMurrayyy) September 14, 2015 \n \n8. There’s a hell lot more in store where that came from. \n \nAs the finale wrapped up we were treated to a sneak preview of what’s around the corner in the new season soon to hit our screens. \n  \nOMG IVE MISSED SPENCER MADE IN CHELSEA SEASON 10 PLEASE COME QUICK \n \n— NYASHA (@zagarinocity) September 14, 2015 \n \nThe gang is back in Chelsea and seemingly welcomes the return of Spenny, Ollie and Rosie (though no one is too enthused about that) as well as shock news of infidelity in Tiff and Sam’s relationship – and this time, it isn’t on Sam’s part… \n  \nTIFF CHEATS ON SAM WHAT #MadeInChelsea \n \n— Sophie Scott-James (@SophieScottJame) September 14, 2015 \n   \n Share article  \n    \n  \n 
0038_8ff9a4d1-a7b0-4e02-a55f-5df0f6031893	NEW YORK \n\n"As we talk to new parents worldwide, it's clear that children's happiness and feelings of being loved are of primary importance," said Jean McKenzie \n\n"EQ, or emotional intelligence, is the ability to understand emotions in oneself and others, and to use that understanding to achieve positive goals," said Sara Harkness \n\nThe Moms' Hopes & Wishes Study, conducted by Illuminas Global on behalf of Fisher-Price, measured parental attitudes and approaches to Early Childhood Development with 3,500 new and soon-to-be moms in seven countries. Though findings indicated more similarities in beliefs than differences, the study highlights cultural nuances, or 'parental ethnotheories,' apparent in specific countries. For example, one question asked, "What qualities are important for your child to achieve?" In response, Chinese moms in the survey valued grit/tenacity, Brazilian moms said environmental awareness, and Russian moms chose athleticism. Another question asked moms what level of agreement they had with the notion that development begins at birth. This resulted in a wide range of responses, with the highest level of agreement from Russia \n\n"It's been proven that development begins at birth, and parents can greatly impact their child's future success in the early years just by loving and engaging with their child every day," said Shakira. "Through the work I've done with my Barefoot Foundation, I've seen parents make a big difference in their child's healthy development through the daily practice of things like reading to them, talking, singing or even simply playing. We as parents are their first teachers and it's never too early to start." \n\nShakira also previewed her parenting app, Grow, for post natal moms. The app features 2,000 tips including play ideas, mini articles and activities customized to a child's age to foster early childhood development from birth and through age five in a fun and easy way. The app also features a timeline to track developmental milestones with the ability to share out with friends and family. The app will be available later this fall.\n\nIntrigued to see what the 3.2 million Fisher-Price Facebook followers have to say about the survey findings, the Company is engaging parents in a four-week global conversation starting this week. Each week, questions from the survey will be fielded to the community for responses. Additionally, a microsite featuring a summary of the global study, as well as country-specific data and articles, is available by visiting www.fisher-price.com/HappyFactor. \n\n"We want to engage moms around the world on their views of early childhood development, and this study is just one of the ways we hope to spark conversation with parents and the organizations and communities that support them," said McKenzie. "It's part of living our promise to help enrich the lives of families with young children."\n\nThis event is part of the Company's ongoing Best Possible Start campaign aimed at elevating the importance of early childhood development to the new generation of parents.\n\nAbout the Survey and Key Findings\n\nThe Moms' Hopes & Wishes Study was conducted during a four-week period between February and March of 2015, across various socio-economic groups, with more than 3,500 moms between the ages of 21-40 years old. Fifty percent of the participants were first-time, pre-natal moms; the rest were first-time moms of a single child, 0-18 months old. Local surveys were conducted online or in-person across seven countries, including China \n\nOptimistic About Baby's Bright Future \n\nWhen asked about the opportunities their child will have to fulfill their potential compared to the opportunities they had, moms in five out of seven countries felt their children will have it better, with over 80% percent agreement in China \n\nFirst & Best Teacher?\n\nAll countries have high agreement that "A parent's relationship with baby is the foundation of healthy development." However, it was China \n\nLet Children Be Children\n\nRoughly half of moms surveyed felt it's important to push children to reach their full potential, and for their children to reach milestones quickly and ahead of others. This was especially evident in Brazil \n\nPower of Play\n\nThe study revealed that moms are definitely engaged in play with their child. In fact, one of the top-ranked parenting attitudes was "Play is the way children learn naturally."\n\nAbout Fisher-Price\n\nIn 1931, Herman Fisher \n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150924/270619 \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-new-iq-fisher-price-international-study-reveals-todays-moms-highly-focused-on-developing-their-childs-character-as-much-as-intelligence-300148839.html\n\nSOURCE Fisher-Price

0042_de551d14-d99e-43ac-977d-3ea193653681	LONDON , Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Summary \n\nAfter a promising number of mobile wallet initiatives in 2011, with Google Wallet a driving force, market expectations have fallen somewhat flat. Despite the emergence of alternative payment solutions, though, mobile wallet solutions appear to be back on the radar. The entire mobile industry (smartphone manufacturers, telecommunication companies, and chip makers) coupled with the finance ecosystem (banks, financial Institutions, payment processors, and platform providers) have invested heavily in the mobile payment opportunity. According to Frost & Sullivan, the value of mobile payment transactions will reach  billion in 2020, with a % compound annual growth rate (CAGR) evident from 2014 to 2020. Moreover, the number of active users will increase rapidly to reach million in 2023. By 2020, Asia-Pacific will represent % of transaction value, while the European region will hold a % share. \n\nThe mobile wallet will evolve from a simple payment solution to an application that will support various services such as loyalty and couponing. Mobile wallet adoption is directly linked to consumer perception  consumers must be convinced that it provides a real value add with discounts and coupons. The market is still fragmented, featuring a number of technologies, electronic devices, and security features. Nevertheless, consolidation is evident, with dedicated partnerships or acquisitions to take place in order to facilitate communication with a single product or brand, or message promotion. Innovation continues apace; wearable devices will undoubtedly have an impact on payment trends by changing usage models and consumers habits. Mobile wallets will probably be able to interact with or be embedded in wearables. \n\nBackground \n\nThis analysis will answer the following questions for a global audience: \n\n- What is the current mobile wallet landscape, and what are the latest trends? \n- How much mobile wallet revenue can be expected through 2020? \n- What is the anticipated adoption rate? How is the mobile wallet evolving by region? \n\nDigital transformation has already happened in many banks and financial institutions. Services have been integrated into Web platforms, and a cloud-based approach appears to be the way to optimize costs and provide an exciting customer experience. Mobile devices are at the centre of this new strategy. Mobile payments and banking are now standard services at all banks. \n\nThe increasing number of new payment solutions, security mechanisms, and mobile technologies is revolutionizing the payment ecosystem; however, new entrants, historical participants, and innovative challengers have to fight to promote their solutions or initiatives. A flood of product announcements has left consumers bewildered and reluctant to adopt mobile payments. As a result, mobile wallet adoption has fallen short of expectations. Even in this challenging context, the payment industry is promoting mobile wallets as being frictionless, convenient, and speedy. \n\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3307339/ \n\nAbout Reportbuyer \nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers \nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com  \n\nFor more information: \nSarah Smith  \nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com \nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com  \nTel: +44 208 816 85 48 \nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com \n \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mobile-walletsamazon-apple-and-google-seek-the-winning-strategy-300152153.html \n \nSOURCE  ReportBuyer \n\n\n\nCopyright 2014 PR Newswire.

0043_a48db5c0-5d9d-4102-a7c5-c8c262c81728	As Vladimir Putin flagged his first appearance at a United Nations General Assembly in a decade, world leaders were left grappling with the global impact of Russia's dramatically increased role in the Syrian conflict. \n\nNew York: As Vladimir Putin flagged his first appearance at a United Nations General Assembly in a decade with a 60 Minutes interview aired on Sunday night in America, world leaders were left grappling with the global impact of Russia's dramatically increased role in the Syrian conflict.\n\nSpeaking on America's leading network news magazine, Putin brushed off the suggestion he was a modern tsar and made it clear that the cost of Russia's involvement in the war on Islamic State (ISIL) was going to be some accommodation of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who has used chemical weapons against his own citizens in a war that has killed over 200,000 and forced millions more to flee, destabilised the region and rent the fabric of the European Union.\n\nThis new reality was already being digested by members of the coalition fighting Islamic State – including Australia – which had said since talks in Geneva in 2012 that Assad had no future in a post-war Syrian government.\n\nRussia – and indeed Assad himself – had changed the ground beneath the coalition's feet, even as the Russian-backed conflict in eastern Ukraine slipped into low gear.\n\nTo America's shock, Iraq on Sunday announced it had come to an agreement with Russia, Syria and Iran to cooperate in the fight against ISIL. This comes after Russia dispatched aircraft and heavy weapons to Syria.\n\nDuring his 60 Minutes interview Putin declared that this was perfectly legal and done at the request of the Syrian government, in contrast to the actions of the American-lead coalition.\n\n"In my opinion, provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to modern international law and the United Nations charter," he said\n\n"We've been providing assistance to legitimate government entities only."\n\nEarlier in the day the United States Secretary of State, John Kerry, held talks with the Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on the issue.\n\nLater, a separate senior State Department official described the talks as a "very thorough exchange of views on the political and military implications of Russia's increased engagement.\n\n"We are at the beginning of trying to understand what the Russians intentions are in Syria, in Iran, and to try to see if there are mutually beneficial ways forward, we have a long way to go," she said.\n\nShe said the US was seeking not only to "deconflict" – that is to try to ensure that the two coalitions now fighting ISIL do not stumble into one another – but also to see if there was a political way forward.\n\nShe said Iraq had not been discussed in the meeting.\n\nShe also noted that Russia's increased engagement in the conflict carried with it responsibility.\n\n"Now, when a country becomes more deeply engaged, that does increase responsibility for the outcome and increase risk, so, those are obviously things that have to be considered on the Russian side."\n\nIn fact, Russia's support of Assad since the beginning of the conflict in Syria in 2011 has arguably prolonged the war and exacerbated the bloodshed.\n\n"The destruction of Syria is a consequence of the policies of Assad," the Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders after a counter terrorism meeting attended by the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, on Sunday morning in New York.\n\n"You see everyday the bombing. Most of the refugees are fleeing Assad, and ISIS."\n\nNonetheless, Mr Koenders was among the Western diplomats still wrestling with Assad's future roll.\n\n"All countries have an interest in ensuring there is not a complete destruction of Syria. That means in essence we must have a diplomatic solution … and I would go by what we have agreed in Geneva, that is a transition government is there to come, but there is no future for Assad."\n\nBut asked if that meant Assad had to stand down before a new government could be formed, Mr Koenders said it was more important to focus on what was most successful for peace.\n\n"My view is that the positions are ambiguous," he said.\n\nThe first concrete evidence that partners in the war on ISIL might be softening on their stance on the removal of Assad came last week when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said following an EU leaders' meeting that talks on the Syrian conflict should involve Assad.\n\nLeaders and diplomats in New York this weekend were still grappling to find forms of words to explain this change.\n\nAustralian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop insisted that the acceptance that Assad might have some role in a political solution in Syria was not a "softening", but a recognition of the new reality.\n\n"Australia's position is that all options should be on the table. Nothing should be discarded at this point, no permutation of a political solution should be rejected, while we consider what is realistic and what is achievable.\n\n"That is realpolitik, that is being realistic. In 2011 there was a Geneva process that set out what the coalition partners believed was achievable at the time. It hasn't achieved it, so therefore we should reconsider the position."\n\nAustralia's interest in Syria's future is manifold and complicated.\n\nNot only are Australian forces engaged with the fight against ISIL, but an estimated 120 of its citizens are fighting with militant groups in the region.\n\nAnd then there is the question of the investigation of the shooting down of MH17, which claimed the lives of 38 Australian citizens and residents, and of which Australia is taking a leading role.\n\nThere is some speculation that one of Mr Putin's goals in the ongoing power play is too secure assurance that the investigation will not lead to prosecutions.\n\nSo far most credible analysis pins the blame for the disaster on Russian-backed separatists operating in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMs Bishop has insisted Australia will not cease in efforts to pursue justice over the atrocity. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Can you ever really get away from the terror and learn to trust yourself again? \n\nResa Goldberg's provocative and, at times, painful new memoir, Love Me Madly (published by Moonshine Cove Publishing, LLC. ( www.moonshinecovepublishing.com ) introduces her as a starry-eyed teenybopper whose innocence is crushed by a series of horrifying sexual and physical assaults that spanned two years during high school. The book chronicles her journey from that harrowing trauma to divorced mom navigating the shoals of Internet dating. Somehow, and despite considerable evidence to the contrary, she never abandons her abiding belief that not only does Mr. Right exist, but that he's right around the corner---hidden somewhere in that Rogues Gallery of boys and men. \n\nThe payoff at the end provides the author an understanding of the past--why she has made such bad choices, a way forward into a happier future and finally a mission to help girls and women who may have suffered similar experiences. \n\nAt Goldberg's official book launch ( www.resagoldberg.com ) she donated a portion of her book sales to and organized a raffle for Safe Alliance, an organization that assists victims of sexual assault, teen pregnancy and domestic violence. On September 3, Mike Collins, host of WFAE's "Charlotte Talks" program (Charlotte's NPR affiliate) interviewed her about her experiences, what she has learned and how she is continuing to forge her relationship with Safe Alliance and speak out against violence against women. ( http://wfae.org/post/abuse-and-recovery-love-me-madly-memoir ). She was joined on "Charlotte Talks" by Licensed Professional Counselor Dr. Christopher McCarthy, co-creator of the Turnaround Anxiety Program and Blog ( www.turnaroundanxiety.com ). \n\nThe story that inspired Love Me Madly: A Memoir has also been featured in The Charlotte Observer ( http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/books/reading-matters- ... 16263.html ), The Carolinas Weekly Newspapers ( http://thecharlotteweekly.com/arts_entertainment/2015/07/south-charlo ... es-memoir/ ) and Today's Charlotte Woman ( http://issuu.com/tcwmagazine/docs/tcw_aug_sept_2015/10?e=5554085/14448382 ). \n\nResa has more than 20 years experience as a reporter, writer and editor for radio, television, newspapers and magazines and a master's degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Georgia. Her work has been published in both local and national publications, including The Business Journals, Pro, Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal and NASCAR Illustrated. She has helped launch three magazines in Charlotte, where she currently lives. \n\nLove Me Madly: A Memoir is available at Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/Love-Me-Madly-Resa-Goldberg/dp/193732771X/ref=s ... e+Me+Madly ) and Barnes & Noble ( http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/love-me-madly-a-memoir-resa-goldberg/ ... 1937327712 ) and Resa is also available for motivational speaking engagements at universities or civic groups.

The Nasdaq biotech index <.nbi> slumped 4 percent. \n\nThe New York Times reported that steep price increases for specialty drugs was partly due to companies buying old, neglected drugs and turning them into "specialty drugs". ( http://nyti.ms/1Yvz0Xl ) \n\n"Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on," Clinton said in a tweet. \n\nBefore the mid-session decline, all three major indexes had risen 1 percent, with technology and financial stocks leading the gainers. \n\nThe market closed sharply down on Friday as the Federal Reserve's decision to keep rates unchanged stoked fears of slowing global economic growth. \n\nInvestors will be looking for hints on when the Fed may finally raise rates when a number of central bank officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, appear in public this week. \n\nThe Federal Reserve's decision to delay an interest rate increase last week was largely a "risk management" exercise to be sure recent market volatility would not become a drag on the economy, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday. \n\nFears of slowing growth in China sparked a sharp selloff in global stock markets in recent weeks and the Fed's comments about the global economy exacerbated those concerns. \n Pages

0048_79f3b4cd-39d2-46c5-b3af-d998e4f4f17b	Jessa Seewald has offered up the first signs that the Duggar family may be imploding after Josh Duggar ’s horrendous behaviors have come to light. Up until Jessa’s latest Twitter post on Tuesday, the family stood silently behind Josh after he made a confession that he has an infatuation with porn, along with being named a client of Ashley Madison by online hackers. \n \nSince Josh’s Ashley Madison reveal, his immediate Duggar family has been noticeably quiet, besides Josh’s brother-in-law, who wants his sister Anna to leave her cheating husband. Now Jessa has joined ranks online with her father-in-law, who published an open letter condemning Josh for calling himself a Christian, but acting otherwise, reports MSN News on September 2. \n \nMichael Seewald, who is Jessa’s father-in-law, used strong and harsh words when calling out Josh’s behavior on the Seewald family’s website. On Tuesday, the 22-year-old Jessa Duggar Seewald took to Twitter to write, “Go to seewalds.com and read the post on Ashley Madison scandal." On Thursday morning there were "too many requests" and you couldn't get to the Seewald family site. \n \nPreviously Jessa hinted to her disdain for what her brother did when posting a passage from the Bible on Instagram, 1 John 1:6,  which reads, "If we say we have fellowship with [God] while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth." This appeared to be Jessa’s subtle way of letting the Duggar fans know that she does not condone what her brother did. \n \nHer subtle way is now replaced by introducing this spew from her father-in-law. People Magazine suggests that Jessa turned her back on her brother with this latest tweet. They too wonder if a "family feud" is brewing within the Duggar family. \n \nHer father-in-law was anything but subtle and while he is related to Jessa through marriage, some might find it a bit odd that he has jumped into the spotlight to condemn Josh’s behavior when he really has no connection to him. If it were Anna’s father, that would be different, but he is not. \n \nThe lengthy post read similar to a sermon and included, “It distresses me to say that Josh Duggar’s greatest sin is a byproduct of the sum total of his secretly sinful lifestyle. That is, that by his hypocrisy, he blasphemed the name of God. He claimed to be a Christian, but by his deeds he has suggested otherwise," Michael Seewald claims to write this post because he has "an overwhelming desire to vindicate the name of God." \n \nApparently Jessa agreed with him because she was directing readers his way. This can’t put Jessa in a favorable light with the Duggar family who are close-knit and stick together. This appears to be the first sign of the online wreckage Josh is leaving in his wake from all that sinning, which Michael Seewald so graciously points out.

0050_418ba2dd-bdbe-4d7c-b9ad-63b175ae794b	I bought a large chunk of ground beef at Mitchell's so I could make a big meatloaf for the dog. To the 700gm (close to two pounds) of beef I added 1/4 cup bred crumbs, salt, mixed pepper, fresh garlic chopped, a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme, a sprig of rosemary. In a bread pan I laid a stripe of tomato ketchup along the bottom, placed the loaf on top and spread dijon mustard liberally over the load. Then more ketchup on top.  Into the oven at 350F for 1.25 hours. Fresh carrot with frozen peas for the vegetable and mashed potato for the starch. A humble meal but it tasted good. The dog loved the meat loaf better than ground beef with salt. He's a fussy eater so this surprised me. Fern had a sandwich of meatloaf next day for lunch so I think that says enough about it.
0051_e0bcd737-c8be-468e-9156-dabf83246c6d	MARINA DEL REY, Calif. \n\nThe campaign, called " Family," was developed to appeal to the company's key demographic: on-the-go women and moms, ages 18-49 years old. Comprised of two separate spots – "What Sport Do We Play?" and "Oops!" – "E-hydrate Family" is designed to reach consumers searching for high quality, convenient, natural products that not only taste great but make them, and their families, feel great too. "What Sport Do We Play?" opens to a mom starting her busy day, tossing backpacks and briefcases as she gets her family ready and out the door. She goes on to explain the "sport" she plays, highlighting how it has no timeouts and never stops because the "sport" she plays is being a mom. That's why she loves E-hydrate Protein On-the-Go; "It's the only on-the-go protein that's low in sugar and ready when you are." Becoming emphatic and passionate, she expresses how she can never, ever stop — a rallying cry that catches her husband and young soccer-playing daughter by surprise.\n\n"Oops!" showcases the natural KIDS E-hydrate hydration + immunity drink mixes available at Target. The scene opens on a pig-tailed "professional mess maker" who's all of 6 years old, enjoying a glass of Fruit Punch-flavored KIDS E-hydrate in the living room when —oops! — she "accidentally" spills, (make that, "impishly pours"), the drink on the beautiful hardwood floor. The same thing happens with a bottle of Strawberry Lemonade-flavored KIDS E-hydrate. But it's no problem because, "KIDS E-hydrate doesn't have any colors, so Mom doesn't get mad if I have an "accident," says Little Miss "Mess Maker" with a grin. \n\nBoth spots are currently airing nationwide in rotation on ABC Family, Bravo, Cooking Channel, Discovery Family, Disney XD, E!, Food Network, HGTV, Cartoon Network and WE TV.

0052_6fcb12fc-0cc1-4e9d-b204-de6584d888a7	THE HAGUE : Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima left for Parliament's opening on Tuesday for the last time before their opulent and historic "Golden Coach" undergoes an extensive refit. \nMade of teak wood and covered with gold leaf, the coach is used each year to transport the Dutch royals from the king's offices at Noordeinde Palace to Parliament about a kilometre (0.6 miles) away. \n\nPart of the pageantry of "Prinsjesdag" (Prince's Day), which is traditionally held on the third Tuesday of September, the royal couple is cheered by thousands of well-wishers along the way. \n\nDrawn by eight black steeds, the coach has a plush interior and has been in use by the Dutch royals since 1901, three years after it was delivered to then reigning Dutch Queen Wilhelmina. \n\nBut it has been showing signs of wear in recent years and will now undergo "maintainance over the next three or four years," the Dutch government said in a statement. \n\nThe royals will in the meantime ride in the much older "Glass Coach" which, although not as glitzy on the outside, is as opulently upholstered with purple velvet and a roof upholstered with white silk. \n\nAfter arriving at Parliament's historical 13th-century "Knights' Hall", King Willem-Alexander delivered a speech written by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, outlining the government's plans for the year. \n\nThe Golden Coach has in recent years courted controversy, with detractors saying the paintings on its doors, notably showing black slaves bowing to white masters, glorified Dutch colonial oppression.
0053_1761977c-bb03-48b1-b213-74f6501a8768	STEVE SMITH said the bouncer which caused England captain Eoin Morgan's concussion left several Australia players "shaken" having brought back memories of the fatal injury to Phillip Hughes. \nMorgan was dazed and unable to play any further part in the match after being struck on the helmet by a short ball from Mitchell Starc in the seventh over of the fifth ODI. \n\nAustralia went on to win the match by eight wickets and the series 3-2. \n\nThe England skipper was "up and about" by the end of the match according to coach Trevor Bayliss but he was deemed unable to take any part in the post-match ceremony. \n\n"He has got a bit of a lump and a headache and it is an anxious moment whenever anyone gets hit but the fact he walked off the field was a good sign. He was a bit dizzy for a while and it took an hour or so to come good." \n\nMorgan was monitored by England medical staff after leaving the middle but Starc, who played in the match between New South Wales and South Australia in November last year which claimed Hughes, was clearly shaken up. \n\nDarren Lehmann saw fit to immediately walk around the boundary and talk to Starc and Smith admitted that a few of their number were affected. \n\n"I think there were a couple of guys that were a bit shaken up and Starcy in particular. Obviously it was a tough summer for us back home, losing a close mate. It's always nasty when you get a blow like that." \n\nSmith added: "Hopefully Eoin is OK." \n\nMorgan has been hit three times on the helmet by Australian bouncers in the Royal London Series and Bayliss believes he may have to analyse his technique against the short ball. \n\n"We'll probably have to look at him and see if there's anything technically different he can do," he said. "I haven't had a chat with him yet but I'm sure that's something we'll look at going forward."

0055_af162859-f6e7-48f5-a484-fcf1f2d2b79a	(September 09, 2015) NEW YORK, Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. (NASDAQ CM: SINO) ("Sino-Global" or the "Company"), a Virginia company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related services, today announced the formation of SGS Logistics, the Company's U.S.-based freight forwarding and logistics services network (the "Network"). The Network is a part of Sino-Global's new strategic plan to grow its business in the U.S. and is intended to extend the Company's integrated service platform into the freight forwarding business. It is intended that during the initial phase, the Network will have operations in the North East and the West Coast; both operations will be led by industry veterans, each with over 20 years of experience in the shipping and logistics industries. \n\nFreight forwarding and logistics services entail the transportation of cargoes from one destination to another, including the moving and processing of cargoes, management of necessary paperwork, duties, and compliance with related rules and regulations. Given the large scope of the international shipping business, along with its numerous requirements, the Company believes freight forwarding services presents a substantial business opportunity for Sino-Global. The Company believes that the Network and the resulting service platform would aid in the establishment of a U.S.-based door-to-door freight forwarding service platform for clients with containerized cargoes leaving the U.S. for China, or from China to the U.S. The Company believes these services will help ensure that cargoes get to their proper destination by an agreed upon date, and in good condition and they would include, among other things, custom clearance and trucking services.\n\nOverview of the SGS Logistics Network SGS Logistics will be the freight forwarding and logistics services network for Sino-Global, designed to capitalize on the rapidly growing containerized shipping market in the U.S. The Network, the Company believes, would provide customers with reliable, cost-effective, customized solutions while allowing participating Network members, such as small- and medium-size U.S.-based freight forwarding and logistics companies, to service the logistics needs of Sino-Global's customers - clearing their shipments through customs and transporting their cargoes from the unloading ports to their final destination. \n\nMr. Lei Cao, Chief Executive Officer of Sino-Global, said, "Leveraging this logistics services network, Sino-Global believes it can develop a strong, US-based business and related cash flows while gradually redirecting our strategic focus away from China. We believe that there is a robust U.S. market and growing demand for customized logistics services, based on discussions we have had with various cargo owners, freight forwarding companies and trucking companies. Our strategic approach is to meet freight forwarding needs of customers by leveraging the strength of an integrated services network. Through SGS Logistics, we believe this can be the ideal platform to bring these parties together in a mutually beneficial way, while remaining firmly committed towards continued profitability and increasing shareholder value."\n\nAbout Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd.\n\nFounded inthe United States of America in 2001, Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. is a company engaged in shipping, chartering and related services.

0056_4bbd75b9-a563-4a09-be24-2c4ddabaf832	DON’T get me wrong – I enjoyed this book very much indeed. It has an unobtrusively elegant prose style coupled to propulsive plot momentum; deft characterisation and intelligent commentary.\n\nSweet Caress\n\nWilliam Boyd\n\nBloomsbury, £18.99\n\nI suppose my misgiving is a vague sense that if I had set out to write a hoax William Boyd novel, it would have been very similar to Sweet Caress.\n\nLike James Todd in The New Confessions or Mountstuart in Any Human Heart, the protagonist is an artist (although in this case female, and a photographer) through whose eyes we witness the major events of the 20th century. Amory Clay’s relationships with men – her father, her lovers, her husband, a late flowering lust, her daughter’s inamorato – are conditioned by combat and the repression of what is done or left undone in war. As with Restless, there is an examination of how younger generations deal with the compromises of the old. There is still the same comedy that typified his first novel, A Good Man In Africa, though it’s more shrewd and less antic. It is especially sharp when dealing with stereotypically “British” attitudes (and there are laugh-out-loud moments, for example, the procurement of a fake moustache to practise kissing in a girls’ school).\n\nAs one would expect from the author of the fictitious biography, Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960, the text is judiciously peppered with what the reader is encouraged to believe are Amory’s own photographs. It’s a typically Boydian wink that the epigraph, from which the title is taken, comes from one of the fictitious characters in the novel. \n\nAmory’s father, an intermittently successful ghost story writer, comes back from the Great War haunted. Affection comes from her uncle, who gives her her first camera. Through that lens we see Edwardian society London, Weimar Germany, post-Depression America, the British Union of Fascists, the Second World War in France, a Highland estate in post-war decline (Boyd is at his most Waugh-like in this section), Vietnam and drop-out communities in California. It’s the kind of panoramic scope the reader has come to expect from Boyd.\n\nEarly on, she tells her schoolteacher that she wants to live, and it is certainly a replete life. The title is a clever pun – not all the sweet caresses are Amory’s canoodlings – and signals An Issue, which is actually handled with a great deal of sensitivity and tact, and which balances Amory’s determination and impetuosity very skilfully indeed. There is also a very neatly concealed revelation on the last page. I would advise the reader to keep a careful note of the dates, and that even committing the cardinal sin of turning to the last page first won’t reveal it.\n\nThere is a great deal to admire here. Uncle Greville also introduces Amory to a game in which anyone they meet has to be summarised and visualised in just four adjectives. It is especially clever as the reader will find a great many more than four adjectives running through their head in attempting to “fix” Amory’s character; by turns honourable, reckless, naïve, thrawn, tragic, sardonic, gleefully open and mysteriously reserved. \n\nBoyd plays the game himself: in the final pages Amory muses on her “three score years and ten” which “have been rich and intensely sad, fascinating, droll, absurd and terrifying – sometimes – and difficult and painful and happy. Complicated, in other words”. The “four adjective rule” allows the minor characters a degree of depth.\n\nCuriously, many of the best passages forgo the grand sweep of history altogether. Amory’s father, before the war, does handstands to entertain his daughters, walking around and saying, “I look at you girls hanging from your feet like bats and I feel sorry for you, oh, yes, in your topsy-turvy world with the earth above and the sky below”. It’s a charming vignette, suffused with melancholy – he never does handstands after the war – and its view of the world turned upside down spidering out through the narrative. \n\nIn one of the later sections, set in the 1970s with Amory living in a Highland cottage, she has a conversation with a neighbour, a retired astrophysicist. Explaining the problems with the Standard Model of cosmology, she tells Amory about dark matter and dark energy, those postulates that “explain the things that don’t add up, in theory”. Boyd gets in his rebuttal early – the astrophysicist immediately gripes about the appropriation of hard science into metaphor, but Amory runs with it anyway, imagining “dark” love (why you fell and feel for the wrong person), “dark” illness, “dark” politics. “The ‘dark’ concept explains why you can’t explain things,” she says. “It’s wonderfully liberating. Why won’t my car start this morning? It started yesterday. ‘Dark’ auto-engineering… You see, the ‘standard model’ of the human condition just doesn’t work either.” \n\nThis is quite beautiful. Boyd is one of the only novelists I can imagine who might write a whole novel set during a dinner party where interesting, witty, memorable things could occur. In a way, his most famous “hook” – the swathe of great events – is the part he needs least. I would never regret the very pleasant afternoon I spent reading this novel. But there is something so polished and smooth-running about it as to seem almost disingenuous. It might not stall or misfire, but one never feels the accelerator being pushed to the floor either. \n\nIt might be the chutzpah of introducing real historical figures is missing, or the shimmer of criminality. It is nevertheless supremely accomplished, in both the positive and negative senses that word can bear.\n\nTrigger Mortis\n\nAnthony Horowitz\n\nOrion, £18.99\n\nIN THE latest of the Bond novels written after Ian Fleming’s death, Anthony Horowitz continues the franchise. He isn’t the first but he did have an advantage; a 500-word unfinished extract written by Fleming involving a car racing plot was passed on by the author’s estate. The piece is in Horowitz’s finished novel, Trigger Mortis, but it is impossible to see the join.\n\nHis novel is reverential to the Bond books, not the films, so don’t expect any 1970s leather blouson jackets. This is dark but stylish mid-Cold War Britain as the space race hots up. The story starts with our hero in bed with none other than Pussy Galore, dating the action two weeks after the death of her cohort and his arch-enemy, Auric Goldfinger.\n\nFortunately for our old commitment-phobe a new mission is soon presented which involves Bond leaving Pussy and learning to drive a Formula One car to enter a race in Nürburgring and foil murderous SMERSH agents. There he meets the evil Korean businessman, Sin Jai-Seong, and his next love interest, Jeopardy Lane. \n\nThere follows sex, violence and cocktail instructions with all the elements necessary for Bond – the spy slipping uninvited into his enemy’s glamorous party and the complicated method by which Sin means to dispatch him after a revelation of a world domination plan. Alongside, there is enough period sexism and casual racism to take the modern reader’s breath away – Bond says he prefers his women resistant, not compliant, and attributes character according to racial stereotype. \n\nThere are missteps. I presume that Horowitz chose to ignore the lampooning of the Austin Powers films. Why else would he include Bond musing on the impact of the deaths of henchmen? And at one point 007 thanks Jeopardy for “always being there for him”, which invokes more cringe than the punny title.\n\nBut such rare lapses perhaps go to illustrate that this is a fitting sequel to the Fleming novels. It would be easy to dismiss as the light reading enjoyed by your average Top Gear audience, but even if that is true, it is an enjoyable offering.\n\nKirsty McLuckie\n\nChildren Of The Master\n\nAndrew Marr\n\nHarperCollins, £18.99\n\nGIVEN that this book has been written by one of Britain’s foremost journalists, it was perhaps appropriate that this review was done in the finest journalistic traditions – with a couple of drinks on board and perilously close to deadline.\n\nSo it’s just as well that, far from sending you to sleep, Marr’s second novel is something of a page-turner. Overlooking the odd irritating literary flourish, it benefits from an entertaining and fluent style as well as the sort of mastery of Machiavellian political machination that one would expect of someone from his background.\n\nSet in the near future, the two main characters in this political thriller about a Labour leadership race are a Blairite lesbian politician and a Scottish Labour MP (something of an endangered species these days) from Ayrshire.\n\nMarr successfully blends fact with fiction freely to create a convincing political landscape that will be instantly recognisable to those with even the most cursory interest in current affairs.\n\nThe fallout from the No vote in the Scottish independence referendum still lingers and Britain has voted to leave the EU (we’ll have to wait to find out what happens on that one).\n\nThere are disgraced bankers, old-fashioned Labour fixers with questionable morals, a narcissistic newspaper columnist, corruption and memories of a terrible massacre of Scottish children linked to the cover-up of a paedophile sex-ring and its connections to a Tory politician.\n\nThe Master is a former Labour prime minister who was once good at winning elections but has grown impatient with the leftwards direction taken by the party (sound familiar?).\n\nAmid the intrigue there are some excellent jokes and the plot bounces along merrily. An entertaining interlude about the vagaries of the newspaper industry takes some delicious swipes at some of the real-life characters within – which couldn’t fail to amuse this fellow political hack.\n\nTom Peterkin

0058_8a8e4676-af8a-4695-816c-7f429555bc46	OPINION: Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership is a chance to unify Australia by leading from the centre, something Tony Abbott was never able to achieve. \n\nAbbott wore a blue tie every day of his rule, the first time a prime minister has worn partisan badging as a permanent personal identification. \n\nHe was never able to achieve what Abbott himself described as the task of an incoming prime minister, making the transition from "tribal chief to national leader". \n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Who is Malcolm Turnbull? \n\n* How the internet reacted * * * The result was that the centre of the electorate, where elections are won and lost, abandoned Abbott. For 18 consecutive months, his government has been in a losing position in the polls. \n\nMost Liberals concluded that this was a permanent condition and, filled with despair, turned to Turnbull. \n\nTurnbull has long been the most popular politician in Australia, and more popular with Labor and Greens voters than with Liberals. \n\nHe intends to govern from what he calls the "sensible centre", socially progressive but economically conservative. \n\nThe harder part for Turnbull will be whether he can unify his own party. \n\nThat is key to the success of his prime ministership. And that is why Scott Morrison is pivotal to the Turnbull project. \n\nTurnbull's last term as Liberal leader failed precisely because he lost the support of the party's right wing, which revolted over his plan to support Kevin Rudd's emissions trading scheme. \n\nThe hard right of the Liberal Party would prefer Morrison as leader and is angry at what they see as Turnbull's treachery. \n\nBut Morrison has resisted all approaches, knowing that he is not ready for the leadership. In surveys asking voters for their preferred Liberal leader, Morrison routinely polls a mere 3 to 5 per cent. Ad Feedback Morrison is a relatively young 46 and likes to say that he's a very patient man. \n\nWhile he decided to vote for Abbott in the leadership challenge, he is also expected to work with a successful Turnbull bid. \n\nIf Morrison can help to mediate between the resentful right and the famous Turnbull intemperance, the government will stand a much better chance of presenting a unified front. \n\nThe advent of Turnbull is not just a personnel change. He will want to move the government to a more active stance on climate change and gay marriage. Anything less will disappoint the electorate. The trick will be to do this without alienating the party's right. \n\nIsn't a looming election, expected with a year, enough to keep the party unified and dissenters disciplined under its new leader? \n\nJulia Gillard counted on just such reasoning. She misjudged. Unity and discipline is not guaranteed. \n\nIf unity is to be a challenge for Turnbull, it will soon be the all-encompassing preoccupation for Labor's leader, Bill Shorten. \n\nShorten has never faced a popular prime minister. That now changes. \n\nShorten's leadership will come under tremendous pressure as the polls shift in favour of the government. - Sydney Morning Herald

0060_8b2248de-96d1-4d0c-bac1-6370dd01b7bf	The League/Facebook \n \nThe League’s founder, Amanda Bradford. \n    \nThe League, a controversial, selective dating app for successful singles, isn’t for everyone. \n \nThe app launched in San Francisco earlier this year, and a few months ago it launched in New York City . \n \nStanford graduate Amanda Bradford founded The League and, earlier this year,  raised $2.1 million  with the goal of matching up highly motivated single professionals. \n \nThe League is hard to get into — the  only way to get inside the app is by applying to a long waitlist , or by snagging a VIP pass from someone who’s already a member and cutting the line. Someone in San Francisco has even tried selling their VIP pass for $100 on Craigslist . \n \nAt least one Business Insider employee has already made the cut on The League, so we went inside to find out for ourselves what the app is really like to use. \n \n  \n  \n   This is Amanda Bradford. She founded The League with the goal of making power couples by matching up highly motivated single professionals.   \n   The League launched in San Francisco earlier this year, and a few months ago it launched in New York City, too.   \n   Right now the app is still in private beta in New York, but we were able to get a peek inside.   \n   Before you can get into The League, you have to sign up. You’ll be put on a waiting list until you’re approved…   \n   Once you’re finally in and you load the app, here’s the first screen you see.   \n   Loading…   \n   Every day, you’re shown only five potential matches to whom you can say yes or no.   \n   Like Tinder and Hinge, you can swipe right to indicate you’re interested in someone or swipe left if you’d like to pass. Tap the icon on the top right corner to see your matches.   \n   The League puts all your matches in one place. But unlike other dating apps, your matches on The League have an expiration date. If you don’t respond within three weeks, your match will disappear. You can also sort your matches by “best match,”  “recent,” “popular,” and “least flaky.”   \n   Every user on The League has a “concierge” who answers your questions about the app and lets you know about in-app updates.   \n   Users set their preferences for matches. The League’s big promise is that you’re only shown other users who fit your specific criteria, and your profile will only be shown to others that fit your criteria, too. That criteria, apparently, includes gender, age, height, distance, education, and ethnicity.   \n   Here’s Business Insider producer Sam Rega’s profile. You can see where he’s based (New York), his age and height, and his education, profession, and interests. Tap on the icon on the top left corner and you’ll be shown the app’s menu.   \n   Here’s Sam’s profile. You can add pictures of yourself, along with as much or as little biographical information as you’d like.   \n   Other users are shown where you work and your interests, too.   \n   Here’s the full menu. You can look at your potential matches for the day, check out the people you’ve been matched with already, look at your own profile, and more.   \n   Under “settings,” you can see information like how many of your friends are on The League, how many VIP tickets you have (VIP tickets let you invite friends to “jump the line” and get into The League),  and when you joined.   \n   When you’ve exhausted the five people you’ve been shown that day, here’s the message you’re shown. You’re shown a new batch of people each day at 5 pm. Also note the blue dot in the upper right corner — that means you have an alert in your matches, either a new match or new message.   \n   When you match with someone, you can choose to chat with them, or keep swiping through your potential matches.   \n   See the clock symbol in the upper right corner? You can use it to make a match expire, or to essentially unmatch someone. This is the pop-up that appears when you tap the clock symbol.   \n   In terms of app design, The League isn’t all that different from the dating apps you’re probably already familiar with. It’s founder Amanda Bradford’s ultimate goal — matching tons of power couples — that sets it apart.   \n   \nRead more stories on Business Insider , Malaysian edition of the world’s fastest-growing business and technology news website.

0062_b58491e1-10ec-45e5-84ab-251484746f68	[embedded content]  So sad. Adrienne Bailon has called it quits with her fiance, Lenny Santiago, after six years. The actress and the entertainment exec have confirmed that they have ended their engagement, and Adrienne spoke about it on ‘The Real.’  \nAdrienne Bailon , 31, will not walk down the aisle with now-ex fiance,  Lenny Santiago , 44. The couple had been together for an impressive six years, and are coming off of a seven-month engagement . Adrienne has spoken out on the breakup on the Sept. 16 episode of her talk show The Real , expressing her sadness about the breakup, and the love she still has for Lenny. Watch what she had to say! \n \n“My prayer has always been that in not so great moments, you remind yourself that everything in life happens for a reason, and hopefully it will benefit somebody else, it will help somebody else,” she said. “I know a lot of you guys have been asking me… ‘Where is your ring? Are you still engaged?’ and it’s been a very hard decision for me to make… and I am not engaged anymore.”  \n Take Our Poll  \nAw, such a bummer, especially considering the way Adrienne spoke about Lenny at the time of their engagement in February. “I am so excited to be marrying my best friend,” she told  Us . “There’s nothing like having someone that makes you laugh, that encourages you, and motivates you. He’s such an incredible person and they say there’s always a great man behind a great woman and I say the same for him. He’s been that great motivation behind everything I do.” \n \nAdrienne previously dated  Rob Kardashian   back in 2007, and the two broke up publicly in 2009 before Adrienne began dating Lenny. Luckily, Adrienne has a lot of distractions to take her mind off the breakup, including her series, The Real , which you can hear her discuss with us on the  HollywoodLife podcast, right here . \n \nWe’re wishing Adrienne and Lenny the best during this surely difficult time. Are you sad to see the couple split? \n \n— Casey Mink
0063_4fb70860-2b77-4525-958f-fe7f46bdd1bb	The comedies "Transparent" and "Veep", as well as the drama "Game of Thrones", were big winners Sunday night at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. \n \n"Game of Thrones" won final Emmy of the night for outstanding drama series, while "Veep" won for outstanding comedy series. \n\nViola Davis won outstanding lead actress in a drama series for "How to Get Away With Murder", and Jon Hamm wins outstanding lead actor in a drama series for "Mad Men." \n\nActor Jeffrey Tambor won best actor in a comedy for Amazon's groundbreaking "Transparent," about a middle-aged dad who transitions to life as a woman. Tambor, who had been nominated for six prior Emmys but had never won, dedicated his award to the transgender community. \n\n"Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your stories. Thank you for your inspiration," he said. \n\nHis award came after Jill Soloway won an Emmy for directing a comedy series, again for "Transparent." In accepting the award, Soloway noted that despite recent gains, many transgender people still face discrimination and violence. \n\n"We don't have a trans tipping point yet," she said. "We have a trans civil rights problem." \n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won the Emmy for lead actress in a comedy series for her starring turn in HBO's "Veep," about a neglected female vice-president who ascends to the Oval Office. \n\nHer castmate Tony Hale won best supporting actor in a comedy series for playing her loyal political aide. The show also won a writing award. \n\nBut the night's biggest winner may have been "Olive Kittredge," the acclaimed HBO miniseries about 25 years in the life of an acerbic, retired schoolteacher in a seemingly placid Maine town. \n\nIt took home Emmys for best limited series, best actress in a limited series (Frances McDormand, who played the title character), best actor in a limited series (Richard Jenkins, her kindly on-screen husband) and best supporting actor in a limited series (Bill Murray, who didn't show up to claim his award, unfortunately). \n\n"Kittredge" director Lisa Cholodenko and screenwriter Jane Anderson were also honored. \n\nEarlier, actress Allison Janney won best supporting actress in a comedy for her role in "Mom," in which she plays the overbearing mother of a young adult daughter played by Anna Faris. It was Janney's sixth Emmy; she won five times before for "The West Wing." \n\nThe award was presented by Amy Poehler and the ever-provocative Amy Schumer, who quipped, "Let's not forget what this night is really about -- celebrating hilarious women and letting the Internet weigh in on who looks the worst." \n\nSchumer won an Emmy for best variety sketch series for her Comedy Central show, "Inside Amy Schumer," which tackles such hot-button topics as misogyny and female sexuality. "This show fights for what we believe in," Schumer said. \n\nIt was also a good night for retiring fake-newsman Jon Stewart, whose "The Daily Show" won Emmys for best variety talk series and for its director, Chuck O'Neill. \n\nActor-comedian Andy Samberg is hosting the live show, expected to run til about 11 pm ET on Fox. \n\nThe show opened with Samberg in a video that poked fun at TV's overabundance of buzzed-about shows. After being mocked by friends for not keeping up with popular new series, Samberg locks himself in a bunker and watches nothing but TV for a year until he emerges, hairy and wild-eyed, to annoy everyone around him. \n\nSamberg then did a brief monologue in which he cracked jokes about diversity in Hollywood, Paula Deen on "Dancing With the Stars" and -- inevitably -- presidential candidate Donald Trump. \n\n"Donald Trump is running for president, to the delight of uncles everywhere," Samberg said. "And is it just me, or does Bernie Sanders always look like his flight is delayed?" \n\nThe Television Academy will hand out awards in 25 categories, culminating with the night's two biggest prizes: outstanding comedy and drama series. "Game of Thrones," "American Horror Story: Freak Show," "House of Cards" and "Transparent" top the list of shows with the most nominations. \n\nFor those keeping score, HBO leads all networks with 126 nominations (HBO is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN). Far behind in second is ABC with 42, followed by CBS and NBC with 41 each. \n\nThe Television Academy announced new rules this year that allows all 15,000 academy members, not just smaller groups, to vote for awards -- a change some observers believe could benefit shows with large fan bases such as "Game of Thrones."
0064_bada8ea1-639f-4e76-bfc6-a801cfb4a635	Well, that was quick: an economist whose research was cited by the Wall Street Journal in its scare-number piece on Bernie Sanders has hit back, saying that single-payer health care would save Americans nearly $5 trillion over 10 years. The Journal, you may remember, said ZOMG SANDURZEZ PROGRAMZ WOULD COST TEH 18 TRILLYUNZ OF DOLLARZ!!!!! not too long ago. Further, "(t)hese financial savings would be felt by businesses and by state and local governments who would no longer be paying for health insurance for their employees; and by retirees and working Americans who would no longer have to pay for their health insurance or for co-payments and deductibles." Of course, Americans would be "paying for it," with their taxes, and corporations would be paying less, not nothing, but they're still trenchant points. Ho hum, the House Ways and Means Committee votes to make some $38 billion in annual corporate tax breaks permanent. They've had trouble passing this mass of corporate welfare for more than two years at a time -- possibly because when ordinary Americans hear that these tax breaks enable big corporations to pretend their profits are all overseas but their expenses are all here in America, they hate them. Sen. Sanders proposes a national ban on private prisons, which federal, state, and local governments would have three years to accomplish. Mr. Sanders would also bring back the federal parole system -- abolished in 1984 by men who feared everyone would find their penises inadequate -- and ending the minimum on how many immigrants the ICE must detain at one time, a quota that sure sounds like a way of making some crony corporation money. And unlike Messrs. Clinton and O'Malley, no one will be able to accuse Mr. Sanders of suddenly turning on a notion that's benefited his career for years.Kim Zetter, writing for Wired, explains "ransomware," where evil bastards can lock you out of your computer if you don't pay them a ransom. The individuals who allege that you possess child porn and then ask for a few hundred dollars to make the charges go away really deserve their own circle of hell. How to defend against them as best you can? Use anti-virus software and back up your files somewhere off-net. Oldheads already know this, of course. Finally, also from the "ho hum" file: Bristol Palin blogs that President Obama "needs to STAY out of" the Ahmed Mohamed case, and adds that Mr. Obama's invitation for Mr. Mohamed to come to the White House is a "childish game()" that "invites more racial strife." Never mind the people who actually create racial strife -- a bold person like Ms. Palin has the vision to blame those who "invite" their behavior, as if folks creating racial strife are simply powerless to stop their behavior on their own! And someone who employs shouty-caps should know all about "childish games." I wonder where she learned about them.
0065_bb18d0f8-f41f-4850-92a1-da53237dd6fd	Clinton says she opposes Keystone pipeline \n \nDES MOINES, Iowa — Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she opposes construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, breaking her longstanding silence over a project criticized by environmentalists as a threat to the planet’s climate. \n \nThe Democratic presidential candidate said she decided to speak out after concluding the ongoing debate over whether the pipeline should be built had become a distraction to larger efforts to fight climate change. \n \nThat distraction, she said, is “unfortunately, from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward to deal with the other issues. Therefore I oppose it.” \n \nClinton’s announcement came as she has ceded ground in some polls to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has long opposed the project. It also followed the appearance of protesters at some of her recent campaign events holding signs that read, “I’m Ready for Hillary to say no KXL.” \n \nThe former secretary of state had previously said she shouldn’t take a position on the issue, because she didn’t want to interfere with the Obama administration as it considers whether to allow construction of a pipeline that would transport oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. \n \nFrom wire reports \n \nThe announcement was viewed with disappointment in Canada, where Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said as recently as last month that he was confident the next U.S. president would approve the project. \n \n“This is not a debate between Canada and the U.S.,” said Stephen Lecce, a spokesman for Harper. “We know the American people support the project. We will not engage in presidential primary debates.” \n \nLess reluctant was Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who said on Twitter that Clinton’s decision proves she “favors environmental extremists over U.S. jobs.” \n \nSpurred on by environmental activists and liberals who play a key role in the Democratic primaries and vigorously oppose the pipeline project, Clinton had expressed impatience in recent weeks over the Obama administration’s drawn-out deliberations. \n \nHer campaign said the White House was briefed on Clinton’s position prior to her comments and she privately made her opposition to the pipeline known when she discussed her plans with labor officials in recent weeks. \n \nClinton is scheduled to raise money in California over three days beginning Sunday and was sure to face questions from donors on why she had yet to stake out a position. \n \nTom Steyer, a leading environmentalist and top Democratic donor, said it was a “clear example of people power overcoming the special interests” and credited Clinton for joining with “thousands of Americans calling on President Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline in favor of building an American economy powered by clean energy.” \n \nReince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Clinton was being “blatantly dishonest” when she said her role at the State Department had prevented her from taking a position. Concern about Vice President Joe Biden political future played a role, too, he said. \n \n“Clearly, Hillary Clinton’s rapid decline in the polls and the prospect of the vice president entering the race caused her to change course,” Priebus said in a statement. \n \nClinton announced her decision moments after Pope Francis arrived in Washington at the start of a closely watched visit to the United States. Her opposition came in response to a question from a Drake University student attending a forum on prescription drugs. \n \n“I was in a unique position having been secretary of state, having started this process and not wanting to interfere with the ongoing decision making,” Clinton said. “I thought this would be decided by now and therefore I could tell you whether I agree or disagree. But it hasn’t been decided and I feel now I’ve got a responsibility to you and other voters who ask me about this.” \n \nClinton’s main rivals for the Democratic nomination have campaigned against the project. Sanders, who has surpassed Clinton in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, said in a statement he was “glad that Secretary Clinton finally has made a decision and I welcome her opposition to the pipeline. Clearly it would be absurd to encourage the extraction and transportation of some of the dirtiest fossil fuel on the planet.” \n \nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who trails Clinton and Sanders by a wide margin in polls, used the moment to criticize the Democratic front-runner, saying her late-breaking opposition to Keystone is akin to how she arrived at her positions on gay marriage, offering driver’s licenses for people not living in the country legally and the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n“On issue after issue,” O’Malley said in a statement, “Secretary Clinton has followed — not forged — public opinion. Leadership is about stating where you stand on critical issues, regardless of how they poll or focus group.” \n \nClinton said she would roll out a plan aimed at fighting climate change in a few days and noted proposals released earlier in the campaign that would bolster solar energy and produce more renewable energy. \n \nShe said the nation had “a lot of work to do” and that shifting to more renewable energy would create jobs.

His organization's philosophy emphasizes veterans helping veterans through free fishing and outdoor hunting excursions. Miller, who is also a WWP peer mentor, serves veterans in a remote area. \n\nSince 2012, WWP Program Grants has held two annual grant cycles to support the increasing number of returning wounded veterans and their reintegration needs. Miller, whose 2005 deployment to Iraq \n\n"Once I was discharged, I began my passions of hunting and fishing, started inviting other vet buddies along and noticed the healing factor of these trips," Miller said. "The demand for the trips grew and grew and eventually became very costly. So after years of paying out of pocket, I started the nonprofit Warfighter Outfitters, Inc." \n\nMiller says he is proud of his full-time commitment to getting injured veterans outside and engaged. "There is a very casual atmosphere that allows an open forum to discuss the issues at hand," said Miller. Warfighter Outfitters provides participating injured veterans with adaptive vehicles that allow everyone – despite ability level – to engage in the hunting activities that are so popular in the Northwest. \n\nThe Warfighter Outfitters, Inc. board of directors is comprised exclusively of veterans and employs volunteer staff. All contributions to the organization go to its programs. "Warfighter Outfitters is successful mainly due to a large part of the west coast that is essentially barren of activities," said Miller. "Veterans in the Pacific Northwest really enjoy the trips we provide; they are very popular with Alumni. We even had guys travel from states way out of the region to go on our events." \n\nWWP invests in organizations that focus on enriching the lives of injured veterans through an array of programs that seek to improve mental health and wellness; expose wounded service members to new opportunities for physical fitness and activity; connect wounded service members with their peers and communities; and enhance economic empowerment and independence. \n\nAbout Wounded Warrior Project\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150908/264581 \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warfighter-outfitters-inc-is-latest-wounded-warrior-project-grant-recipient-300139390.html\n\n©2015 PR Newswire.

0067_af1a027e-6d32-4d90-a28a-802269cf1dd7	JUDY WOODRUFF: In other news, European leaders are promising new efforts to process thousands of refugees and migrants reaching Greece and Italy. \n \nThe agreement early today also includes more than a billion dollars in aid for those still in refugee camps in the Middle East. \n \nMeanwhile, the crisis stoked new tensions along Serbia’s border with Croatia. Long lines of cargo trucks backed up as the rival nations cut off imports and blocked traffic in a war of words over the flow of refugees. \n \nZORAN MILANOVIC, Prime Minister, Croatia (through interpreter): All that the Serbian prime minister has to do is to stop this flow of migrants, 9,000 in one day. We cannot make 50 refugee camps at the border. What we have done so far is good, and we can cope with 4,000, 5,000 a day, but above that, no. \n \nNEBOJSA STEFANOVIC, Serbian Interior Minister (through interpreter): Croatia is behaving irresponsibly. By imposing this economic aggression, they are hurting the economy of both countries. Serbia is forced to introduce countermeasures. We are not happy about it, but we have to protect our state and our sovereignty. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: More than 40,000 migrants have entered Croatia from Serbia over the last nine days. \n \nGWEN IFILL: The president of China arrived in Washington this evening for a highly anticipated state visit. Xi Jinping’s plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews, after flying cross-country from Seattle. He was greeted by Vice President and Mrs. Biden. Xi has a private dinner with President Obama tonight. He will be formally welcomed tomorrow. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in New York for the first time in nearly a year. The Kremlin said today the focus will be Syria and coordinating the fight there against Islamic State forces. \n \nBut White House spokesman Josh Earnest charged again that Russia’s military buildup will do far more harm than good. \n \nJOSH EARNEST, White House Press Secretary: President Obama will make it clear once again that Russia doubling down on their support for the Assad regime is a losing bet. The likely consequence of them doing so is only to deepen and expand the ongoing crisis in that country. That doesn’t serve the interests of either the Russian people or the American people. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Earnest said Russia’s involvement in Ukraine will be President Obama’s top item. The talks will follow Putin’s address to the U.N. General Assembly. \n \nGWEN IFILL: In Yemen, an Islamic State affiliate claimed an attack that killed 25 Muslims at prayer today. The suicide bombing wrecked a mosque in Sanaa, as worshipers observed the holiday of Eid al Adha. The bomber set off a smaller explosion, then blew himself up as people ran for the exits. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: The government of Colombia and that country’s largest rebel group now say their long-running conflict will end in the next six months. The two sides announced the deal last night in Havana, Cuba, where peace talks took place. A final agreement would end more than 50 years of fighting. The United States welcomed the deal, but Colombia’s conservative political opposition condemned it. \n \nGWEN IFILL: The scandal over Volkswagen cheating on emissions tests is expanding again. In Berlin today, Germany’s transport minister confirmed that rigged V.W.s expanded beyond the U.S. \n \nALEXANDER DOBRINDT , German Transport Minister (through interpreter): We were informed by Volkswagen that there are vehicles with 1.6-liter and 2-liter diesel engines in Europe affected by the manipulations. That is why we will continue to work intensely together with Volkswagen in order to determine what cars exactly are involved. \n \nGWEN IFILL: Eleven million Volkswagen cars worldwide were fitted with the software responsible for the emissions cheating. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this country, the Senate balked again at defunding Planned Parenthood as the price of preventing a government shutdown. Republican conservatives have pushed that plan. But they once again came up short of the 60 votes needed to advance a bill, but only after the two parties traded broadsides. \n \nSEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority Leader: By inserting into this debate a meaningless, losing attack on women as just a waste of time, but they decided, the Republicans have decided once again to place partisan, ideological agendas over the well-being of the nation. \n \nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader: There’s no reason to continue blocking every attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies that are mired in scandal. So, I’m calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing against a shutdown. I’m calling on them to join us in standing up for women’s health instead. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, as you heard, is saying he opposes shutting the government. He’s now expected to offer a so-called clean bill to fund operations throughDecember 11. It’s not clear whether House Republicans will go along. \n \nGWEN IFILL: The world’s largest maker of construction equipment, Caterpillar, will cut as many as 10,000 jobs through 2018. The announcement today is the latest sign of a worldwide slowdown in mining and energy exploration. And that, in turn, held Wall Street back. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 80 points to close back near 16200. The Nasdaq fell 18 points. And the S&P 500 dropped six. \n \nThe post News Wrap: EU strikes agreement on migrant crisis aid appeared first on PBS NewsHour .

0069_a8a198c1-5d16-4f68-93f5-4254edd1fd97	I remember the first time I became consciously aware of my fat attraction. I was sixteen, sitting on the couch with my high school boyfriend watching Ruben Studdard sing “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” on American Idol . My boyfriend was skinny and white, with dyed blue-black hair, and I loved him, as much as an emotionally-embryonic teenager can love someone. I loved him, and I loved fucking him, but watching this 400-pound man on the TV stirred something in me. I wanted his body next to mine. I gave my boyfriend a hand-job, and imagined what Ruben’s heavy embrace would feel like, something like a down comforter mixed with a hot bath. \n \n“It’s not a fetish,” I sometimes find myself explaining. I don’t exclusively fuck fat people, just like I don’t exclusively fuck black people. Out of the—one, two, give me a minute—nine people I’ve slept with or dated this year, three have been fat. Last year I dated two men who you might classify as “obese” and who I classify as “some of the best sex I’ve ever had.” The fact that I even have to qualify my attraction to them outside of fetishization is fucked up and depressing, but that’s the world we live in. Most people are so conditioned to view fat bodies as undesirable that those of us who desire them are automatically labeled deviants. \n\n \nI should probably admit right now that I am fat myself. I’m barely 5′1″ and 135 pounds and wear a size 6 and a 34DD and I’m sure there are many people who wouldn’t call me fat. But I refuse to think of the word “fat” as a negative term. I hate when I make an offhanded comment about being fat, and someone immediately says, “You’re not fat!” as if to consider myself fat is the worst, most self-hating thing in the goddamn world. I’m certainly not thin or skinny, and I grew up thinking of myself as a fat person—I have what I like to call “fat kid brain.” And now that I’ve come to accept and love that part of who I am, thanks to friends and partners and therapy and a career as a nude art model, I’m loathe to let go of that aspect of my identity. I also absolutely have body dysmorphia, which, in conjunction with my anxiety disorder, more often manifests as an issue of perception—whether or not I’m okay with being fat, I never know how other people see me, because I can’t trust what my brain tells me is being displayed in the mirror. It’s one reason why I love Instagram and take so many selfies—it’s the only way I can see myself through other peoples’ eyes. The only way I can ask, “I love my fat body—do you?” And the answer is almost always yes. A big part of learning to think of myself as beautiful was realizing that many of the women I am attracted to are as fat as I am, if not more. And if I want to be with a fat girl, surely there are people out there who want to be with me. \n  \n   \nAnd duh, there are plenty . \n \nIf you’ve never fucked a fat person, take a minute and ask yourself why. Is it that you truly find their bodies ugly? Are you afraid that fat stigma is going to rub off on you, that people will see you loving a fat person and think that means there’s something wrong with you? Are you fat and unhappy with your own body? Are you not-fat and unhappy with your own body? Has the media conditioned you to believe that sex with fat people is somehow more difficult and less enjoyable (spoiler: it’s not)? Or is it that you have fucked a fat person but insisted to yourself or to them that they’re not fat, instead of telling them what part of their fatness you consider sexy? \n \nI could rhapsodize about the feel of soft skin and flesh you can dig your nails into, about men and women with barrel chests and wide asses and round faces and strong arms. But, as choice as I find it, the hotness of fat people is something you have to discover for yourself. \n \nThe other part of loving fat bodies is realizing that, for people socially coded as undesirable for any reason, a fair amount of narcissism is a healthy and necessary thing. In the immortal words of RuPaul, “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?” And this is an issue that I struggle with all of the time. Because I am attracted to fat people, and I am also attracted to people who aren’t drowning in a sea of self-loathing. I don’t want someone who wants to change everything about themselves. I don’t want someone who thinks they can’t have style because they’re fat. I don’t want someone who believes the lie that clothes that highlight their fatness are unflattering. I don’t want someone who doesn’t think fat people can be sexy. I want to be able to give the person who makes me wet a compliment and have them say, “Thank you,” instead of “Ugh, whatever, you’re just saying that”. \n \nI’m not saying that feeling positively about fat bodies, be they your own or someone else’s, is easy. It takes real work to break down the connections in our brain that equate fatness with guilt and shame and ugliness and blame. This is one reason why it’s crucial for there to be an increasingly wider representation of body types in media, and for those representations to be nuanced. It’s one reason why Mindy Kaling’s success, and her show’s depiction of a not-thin woman of color as an intelligent, complicated, and desirable woman who dates all kinds of men is important. There’s this weird standard for on-screen relationships that bleeds out into our everyday lives: that if one person is a certain level of culturally-determined hotness, their partner should be equally hot. That a “10″ should only date other “10s,” as it were. This is not how attraction works. And the unfortunate dialogue that reinforces the idea that some people “aren’t good enough” for us and that others are “out of our league” is probably keeping a fair amount of us from having a healthy relationship with someone with whom we are both intellectually and physically compatible. \n \nThere have been many articles that call attention to the TV husband whose wife is “too hot” for him. I would link to some of them but I...don’t want to, so if you’re interested in substantive proof and/or getting really depressed about male body shaming, you can do what I did and Google “tv husband too fat”. One piece from 2010 opens—sincerely, unironically, and humorlessly—with the line, “In real life, fat guys never get the girl.” Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck yoooooooou. Fuck anyone who has fed into this system that keeps men from believing that women like me exist. And if your argument is that we see fat husbands with thin wives but not the other way around, the solution to that problem is not to body shame fat men—instead, let’s use the fuel of our outrage to get more fat women with diversely hot partners on television. \n \nI once spent a summer in love with a fat friend. We would hang out at his place, watching Freaks and Geeks while I rhapsodized about my crush on chubby, jewfro-ed Seth Rogen. At some point, when I couldn’t take any more late nights spent smoking blunts and pressing my cleavage against his chest and wishing he would just kiss me, I finally said to him, “I am attracted to you in a multitude of ways. How do you feel about that?” He didn’t know. He sent me an email about “valuing his friendships with women” that at the time felt like a classic blow-off. A year later he apologized for how he handled the situation: “I didn’t think of myself as attractive, so I didn’t know what to do when you told me that. I didn’t trust that what you were saying could be true, so I freaked out and pushed you away.” Because of his body shame we both ended up hurt and unhappy, we lost the chance for a romantic relationship, and our tight-knit friendship suffered as well. \n \nI’ve always been an impatient, make-the-first-move kind of girl, but I have a rule against doing that now. I need to be with someone who I know is confident enough to read my blatantly encouraging signals and act on their desire for me. I need someone who doesn’t second-guess my attraction for them, who can look at themselves in the mirror and see a lovable, fuckable, hot-ass body. Yes, I fuck fat people and skinny people and everyone in between—but I only fuck people who don’t hate themselves. Just think of what could happen if we all work a little harder to see and express and depict and acknowledge the endless spectrum of human beauty the world has been gracious enough to give us. We might find ourselves with more—more joy, more orgasms, more opportunities, more love. And a little more can be a very good thing. \n \nEloise LeBel is a Los Angeles-based writer of various concerns, including her blog Sexistential Questions .

0070_b023c0e4-52e9-4d77-a41c-0a3bfa3b3a7d	Dwyer’s View: Enjoy the mometBob DwyerSeptember 16, 2015I’m excited to be going to the Rugby World Cup and it certainly brings back memories of 1991. It’s really not like any other rugby tour  – the feeling when you arrive in the place is that the whole country is alive with anticipation. All of the towns and cities where the teams are based have that feeling of excitement and it gets picked up by the squads. If you approach it in the right way – to have the ‘on/off’ switch – you can really enjoy yourself (sensibly of course). It’s like nothing else and you shouldn’t miss out on the occasion. Having said that you also have as a team squad member to understand that every team there is going to put on its absolutely best performance; having prepared with 28 years of experience (since 1987) of how you prepare for such a tournament. Normally the Wallabies wouldn’t be that concerned about playing Fiji – they have ability but over 80 minutes of a test match we can handle them – but we certainly won’t be going into the first match that way. Fiji are better prepared than ever before. I’ll be keen to see them against England and then on the 23rd. I’ve got great expectations for our team. Sure they can win it (theoretically any team can), but to really do so you need high class players at their best, team-work at its best and you can’t afford an off day. What I can say is that personally I’m confident that the coaching staff and team admin understand their roles very, very well. I’m impressed with the whole coaching staff – it’s as good as anyone is going to have. Cheika has also shown that he’s very good at tournament rugby. He gets them to their best when the best is needed- as shown at Leinster. I’m also encouraged that over the last 12 months he’s been gradually refining the squad to where it is now. View image | gettyimages.com If there’s anything that’s had me a little concerned is that I don’t see that either of our 9s are playing at their technical best. Both have a backswing and move sideways – Phipps does more the former and Genia more the latter. I hope that Steve Larkham has noted it and removed it from the game of two potentially very good players; it’s critically important that we don’t give anyone the chance to disrupt us in the the transition zone from tight to wide. Outside of that I have no great concerns about the team. The scrum is first class – better than anyone in our pool. If reffed properly, we’ll have no problem. With Douglas, Simmons, Fardy – even Hooper or Pocock taking a ball – our line-out will be in good shape as well. I remember well in 1991 we always said that as a team going into the tournament “we believe if we play to the best of our ability we can give any team a shake” and we can genuinely say that now. All we have to do is play to the best of our ability . Some people think our pool is a difficult assignment, but succeeding it leaves us in great shape. If we’re going to go anywhere in the tournament we’ve got to be able to beat Fiji and it gives us a good lead up into England and Wales. It’s an exciting time for us and we’ve got reason to be able to hope our team can play to their best of their ability. As for competition should we progress, over the last few years England have improved, but then in the last few months gone backwards. Can they turn it around? One of the traditionally great tournament teams has certainly been South Africa who can lift, but they haven’t looked good in the lead up. In 1995 New Zealand looked far and away the best team in the comp, but then South Africa played over New Zealand for the whole of the final. In 2007 they managed to beat one team after another to win (what was a lacklustre tournament to be fair). They haven’t looked great this season but will  be there or there abouts. View image | gettyimages.com France struggled totally in 2011 losing two games along the way but then were very unlucky to not be champions, save for a couple of refereeing decisions. Wales have been consistently good but always the bridesmaid and it’s hard to think they can overcome the loss of Halfpenny and Webb. Halfpenny is surely the world’s number 1 fullback with his goal kicking. Webb has risen to being a world class scrum half. How can they survive the loss of both? It’s down to the usual suspects – the three southern hemisphere teams, England and France. I’ve left Ireland out because I haven’t been impressed with their trials at all. They’r really struggling to re-build a three-quarter line bar Rob Kearney. I can’t see who’s going to come through there. How do you win a world cup without one? Shocks? I can see Fiji producing one. I’m not sure of anyone else. Above all the rugby world cup is a celebration of the game and we should approach the tournament that way. Some people say they’re not sure how far Australian can go, should they buy finals tickets? But it’s about the world game and the excitement for all the countries. It’s not just about your team winning, but them all doing their best – otherwise there’s no point in 60% of the teams going at all. Just enjoy it for what it is – a special tournament indeed.

Paul Abbott is in fact an English screenwriter and producer who has worked on shows that critics might arrange to sum up the trajectory of Mr Abbott's term in the big seat:  Reckless, Shameless, State of Play, Touching Evil, Clocking off and  Exile.  \n\nAnd maybe being labelled Paul was one of the nicer ways for Tony to be sent off into his post-prime minister life. \n\nAt the least The Independent cared. Many of our regional neighbours - like The Jakarta Post and the China Daily - were running stories written by wire agencies on Tuesday. \n\nOthers like the Washington Post  are still struggling to get over the time Mr Abbott ate a raw onion, skin and all. \n\n"Tony Abbott, ousted Australian prime minister, is being mocked with photos of raw onions," ran one of its stories . \n\nThe BBC also revived the onion scandal, reporting on the #putyouronionsout social media reaction. \n\nThe New York Times , which recently published an editorial criticising Mr Abbott's approach to asylum seekers , reported that Mr Turnbull " is likely to be more open to the outside world and less conservative in approach then Mr Abbott ". \n\nSeveral international news outlets played up the revolving door of Australian politics, concentrating on the fact that Australia has had five prime ministers in five years. \n\n"Down under, they call it "front stabbing." Turnbull replaced the effective but highly divisive Tony Abbott on Monday to become Australia's 29th prime miinster [sic]," was how  Slate 's coverage started. \n\nAustralia's Wikipedia page was even reportedly altered to say that "the main national sport is the Leadership Spill which fixates the nation on a random but regular basis." \n\nMany outlets also hammed up Mr Turnbull's stance on climate change and marriage quality. \n\nAustralia's conservative prime minister, Tony Abbott, is ousted by his progressive nemesis http://t.co/Fu44W9gQf4 pic.twitter.com/aGyd20JQ8w — The Economist (@TheEconomist) September 14, 2015 \n\nDeputy Prime Minister Julie Bishop has expressed no concern about Mr Turnbull's standing on the world stage. \n\nOn Tuesday morning she told the Today that she had received many calls from world leaders overnight. \n\n"They know Malcolm Turnbull well and he knows many of them personally," she said. \n\nThe story Liberal leadership: World reacts to Malcolm Turnbull ousting Tony Abbott first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .

0074_e0506c0e-7f89-4eea-b15e-cc9926a6918d	The Dallas News.Net  Monday 28th September, 2015  \n U.S President Barack Obama today announced that more than 50 countries have stepped up and promised to contribute 30,000 new troops and police for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and lauded UN chief Ban Ki-moon's efforts to achieve zero tolerance policy against 'abusive peacekeepers'. \nAddressing the Leaders' Summit on Peacekeeping, Obama thanked the international community for rising to the call of committing to world peace in such a significant way. \n \n"Today we are here to together reform the peacekeeping body and together there is much more we need to do. I want to thank all of you. We are very proud that the International community has acted responsibly in such a way," he said. \n \nHe also announced that the United States will double the troops, helicopters, training and defence articles for the peacekeeping operations. \n \n"As the largest contributor to peacekeeping operations, I am issuing new US directives, double US officers. More than 50 countries are committing 30,000 new troops and police and they are stepping up with helicopters and medical units, this represents significant progress," Obama said. \n \nThe US President, however, added that peace operations are not the solution to all problems and stressed on acknowledging that the 'abuse' by peacekeepers has to end. \n \nThis came in the wake of the UN being badly shaken by a string of sexual abuse claims targeting its peacekeepers, in particular in the Central African Republic where many of the 17 allegations involve underage victims as young as 11. \n \nBan Ki-moon had warned that he was ready to throw out entire peacekeeping units if their country fails to take action against soldiers accused of sexual abuse, according to reports. \n \nThe warning was among a series of measures unveiled by the UN chief at a meeting with the 124 countries that contribute troops and police to the UN peace missions worldwide. \n \n"Mr Secretary General, we commend you for raising this issue. We have to ask for zero tolerance on this issue and we need to improve protection of civilians as the current guidelines are being implemented unevenly," Obama added. \n \nHe assured that if the steps that he had announced were embraced, then it would strengthen the peace operations for the decades to come. \n \n"The decision and the commitments that we make today can help ensure that our peacekeepers have success in their mission. I want to thank all of you for your partnership and the commitments that the nations are making here," Obama said. \n \nHe reiterated his stand that the United States will remain a pillar of strength and a strong partner to the rest of the world in this mission. \n \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will also address the summit.

0075_f3a97d44-fd87-4e28-b771-4d3481c6a50e	(CNN) -  \nLaw enforcement officers continued to search Thursday for three men suspected of killing Fox Lake police Lt. Joe Gliniewicz. The suspects have been described only as two white men and one black man. \n\nGliniewicz was a hero to many in Fox Lake, a community of about 10,000 people in northern Illinois. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday night for a vigil to honor the 30-year police veteran. He led the local police explorers' program, mentoring and training youths who are interested in becoming officers. \n\nHe was also a husband and father of four. \n \n"Joe was my best friend and my world. My hero," Melodie Gliniewicz told more than 1,000 people at the candlelight vigil Wednesday evening. \n\nShe said her husband was "the love of my life for the last 26½ years. He was my rock as much as I was his rock." \n\nThe last day of work \n\nGliniewicz was on his way to work Tuesday morning, in the cruiser that he had taken home the day before, when he saw three suspicious people, Lake County Major Crime Task Force Cmdr. George Filenko said. \n\nThis would not have been unusual as Gliniewicz was the type of officer who considered himself on duty as soon as he rolled into town, Filenko said. \n\nThe lieutenant made the first call at 7:52 a.m. and called three minutes later to request backup. The backup units arrived at 8:01 and found their fellow officer dead, roughly 50 yards from his vehicle, at 8:09, Filenko said. \n\nAuthorities initially marked off a 2-square-mile area across tricky terrain and brought in helicopters, K-9 units, federal agents, night-vision equipment and body-heat sensors. Police cleared every home in the cordoned-off area and fielded more than 100 tips, Filenko said. \n\nOn Wednesday, they widened the search area. \n\nSo far, police have found no witnesses, but they are reviewing surveillance tapes from area buildings. \n\n"Videos are coming from a number of places. Businesses. Factories. Gas stations," Filenko said. \n\nThey also have one video from a truck driver who had a camera in his vehicle and was in the area Tuesday. \n\nAn autopsy was completed, but authorities aren't releasing the results yet, Filenko said. The Northern Illinois Police Crime Laboratory is expediting its review of evidence to determine whether there was any fingerprint or DNA transfer. \n\nTechnicians should have that analysis finished within a "day or so," he said. \n\nA challenging search \n\nThe FBI, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined in the hunt. More than 400 law enforcement officers raked through the heavy woods near Fox Lake on foot, all-terrain vehicles and horseback. \n\nLocal police officers have volunteered to come in while they're off duty, and other law enforcement officers in the surrounding area have called to offer their assistance, Filenko said. \n\nAsked whether he had a deadline for calling off the search, Filenko said, "I'm not going to set a time limit on this. I have a murdered colleague. ... We're not going to stop." \n\nFollowing a false lead \n\nOn Wednesday night, an Illinois woman sent 100 officers scrambling after saying she saw two men who fit the description of the cop killers police have been looking for. \n\nBut after hours of searching, police said, they discovered she had made the whole story up. \n\n"It's very disappointing because our resources could have been used somewhere else," Lake County Sheriff's Detective Christopher Covelli said early Thursday morning. \n\nOn Wednesday night, Kristin B. Kiefer, 30, called police and said she was driving and pulled over near a cornfield because she was having car trouble, Covelli said. \n\nKiefer told officers a white man and a black man tried to get in her car, Covelli said. She said when she picked up her phone to call police, the two men fled into the cornfield. \n\nMore than 100 federal, state and local law enforcement officers descended on the area overnight. Eleven K-9 officers and three aircraft also responded to the tip. \n\nBut Kiefer later admitted she fabricated the story because she was looking for attention, Covelli said. \n\nShe was charged with two counts of disorderly conduct -- one felony, one misdemeanor -- due to the false report, the detective said. \n\nKiefer was being held Thursday morning at the Lake County jail and is scheduled to have a bond hearing later in the day.
0076_cfad6032-8b09-45ef-84bd-bec07e5afe0c	Ireland have received a significant World Cup boost with prop Cian Healy passed fit to start after neck surgery. \n\nLoosehead prop Healy has battled neck problems since May, but has recovered just in time and will be available for Saturday’s Pool D opener against Canada. \n\n \n\nScrum-half Conor Murray has been passed fit after concussion, with Rob Kearney also over knee niggles for the Cardiff clash with Canada. \n\nIreland team manager Mick Kearney admitted Healy endured “a degree of pessimism” earlier in the summer, fearing he would miss the World Cup, before grafting his way back to fitness. \n\n“The 31-man squad are all fit and available for selection against Canada for Saturday,” said Ireland team co-ordinator Kearney. \n\n“Cian’s great, obviously Cian had a few dark days across the summer but towards the end of August he made fantastic progress. \n\n“He’s been in full training for the last two weeks and I’m delighted to report that he is available for selection at the weekend against Canada. \n\n“I think the fact that he is available and is fit I think it’s a huge boost to everyone in the squad and a huge boost to Cian as well. \n\n“I think everyone is thrilled for him, because over the last 12 months between a couple of injuries and operations he’s been out of action for a very long time. \n\n“He worked incredibly hard over the course of the three or four months. \n\n“I suppose there was a degree of pessimism about him for a while but certainly towards the end of August that all turned good and he’s been really flying and in great form since then. \n\n“And I think it would be great to see him get some game-time at the weekend.” \n\nJohnny Sexton and Simon Zebo suffered cramp in Ireland’s 21-13 defeat to England at Twickenham on September 5 but recovered without any issues. \n\nIreland head coach Joe Schmidt’s decision to include Healy in his final World Cup 31 has now been vindicated, even though the Leinster prop was not fully fit when selected. \n\nHealy’s presence will provide a clear advantage for Ireland in their target of reaching a first-ever World Cup semi-final. \n\nHooker Rory Best hailed 27-year-old Healy’s return as handing boss Schmidt’s squad a sizeable lift, off the back of consecutive warm-up defeats to Wales and England. \n\n“He’s a world-class player and he’s made an unbelievable recovery,” said Best. \n\n“But we know that about him, he has a tendency to come back really quickly and just to have that capability within your squad. \n\n“We’re very lucky to have Jack McGrath and Cian who are both fantastic looseheads, and you saw Jack really coming to the fore in the last Six Nations. \n\n“That’s put pressure on Cian and you can see the way he’s responded, and the way he’s come back this summer, he’s hungrier than ever to come back in and to try to get that starting spot back. \n\n“And he will be desperate to establish himself again as the world-class player that he is.”

REUTERS/China Daily  \n(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova's return from injury after an almost three-month break was cut short on Monday after the world number three suffered an arm injury at the Wuhan Open in China. \n\nThe Russian, who missed the entire U.S. hardcourt season with a leg injury, was into a deciding set against Czech player Barbora Strycova when she called for the trainer. \n\nDespite playing on for another couple of games she quit while leading 7-6(1) 6-7(4) 2-1. \n\nThe former world number one had not played a match since losing to Serena Williams in the Wimbledon semi-finals in July. \n\nSharapova's latest setback could put the 28-year-old's participation in next week's China Open in Beijing in doubt, but the Russian is hopeful she will be fit for the WTA Finals in Singapore at the end of next month and the Fed Cup final against Czech Republic in mid-November. \n\n"I've had my fair share of serious injuries, and I know that this is far from it, something that I just have to take care of," the 28-year-old told reporters. \n\n"I mean obviously, Singapore and Fed Cup is a big priority for myself.

0079_f8dc32f3-4ddf-427c-9691-c52eaa79e7fc	PR Newswire \n \nPERRIS, Calif., Sept. 29, 2015 \n   \nPERRIS, Calif. , Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The County of Riverside is powering progress through renewable energy, flipping the switch on its first facility to be powered by the sun as part of the largest countywide conversion to solar ever launched in the U.S. Through a collaborative partnership with OpTerra Energy Services, the County celebrated the ongoing implementation of 12MW of solar across 10 sites, starting with the energization of the Perris Sheriff Station today. \n \nLet the Sun Shine \nWith almost 300 days of Southern California sunshine a year, Riverside County was eager to take advantage of their prime real estate for renewable power. The 12MW solar program will generate 18.6 million kWh of clean, renewable energy annually. The implementation of solar photovoltaic arrays will power and enhance the energy portfolio of 10 critical facilities tied to community services – including two sheriff stations, an animal shelter, and even the County health center. \n\nRiverside County's historic solar program is part of a broader effort to continue fostering a more sustainable region, focused on ongoing fiscal stewardship and community engagement across the County. The program will have far-reaching impacts across County cities from San Jacinto , Jurupa Valley, Palm Desert , Temecula , Moreno Valley , and Perris . Residents will benefit from the County's ownership of these new assets, with the program expected to generate approximately $200 million in taxpayer savings over the next 30 years. \n\nAccolades for Ownership \nDuring Tuesday's flip the switch celebration, local leaders recognized the County Board of Supervisors' leadership in ensuring the long-term ownership of their new solar system. Requiring no public capital investment, the County's far-reaching solar footprint utilizes energy savings to pay for all site installations happening through the end of 2015. Additionally, the County took advantage of Southern California Edison's Bill Credit Transfer Program to use excess energy generated at solar project sites to reduce expenses at those County-owned facilities that pay the highest utility rates. \n\nBy purchasing their new solar infrastructure outright, the County will own the system and enable even greater long term fiscal benefits than those anticipated over the 30-year life of the program. \n\nPowering Progress \nThe solar installations will go beyond fiscal savings and provide significant impact on County goals tied to enhancing economic development and quality of life. Some of the many community-focused benefits being captured as program implementation happens this year include: \n Over 1,000 jobs to be created over the lifetime of the program, with 287 jobs created during construction  80% local labor used for the project  40% offset of the County's total energy consumption for its 26 facilities  385,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide offset over the lifetime of the project  \nFrom a comfort level, providing shaded canopies for County residents and employees over existing parking lots across county facilities is a major win for the County as well. Protecting cars from the scorching sun in one of the hottest climates in the country is no small footnote – this benefit was especially pronounced at the Perris Sheriff Station where temperatures inside patrol vehicles can reach over 120 degrees. Shaded canopies keep employees comfortable, while helping prolong the useful life of vehicles by reducing heat related wear and tear. \n\nMore Success on the Horizon \nAs more County facilities' solar installations go online through the end of the year, the County is excited to promote the ongoing positive impact at future community events. The greenhouse gas emissions that will be reduced by this far-reaching project represent the equivalent to removing over 80,000 cars off the road – improving environmental and social outcomes for residents in myriad ways that go further than just fiscal savings. \n\nAbout the County of Riverside : With rivers, mountain peaks, deserts and fertile valleys, Riverside County offers diversity that few locations can match. More than two million people live in Riverside County and even more come to visit each year, taking advantage of affordable housing, nearby beaches, mountains, hiking and bike trails, the Wine Country near Temecula and resorts that offer oases in the desert. The county is working to diversify beyond the housing industry that has driven the region's economy for years. Transportation corridors – highways, airports and rail lines – support Southern California's shipping connection to Asia , a vital link for California and the rest of the nation. \n \nCalifornia's fourth largest county by population is expanding its economy, working to make Riverside County as business-friendly as possible and using health and recreations strategies to make the county a healthier place for residents. The county's commitment to sustainability combines with a rich cultural heritage and frontier history to make Riverside County a great place live, work or visit.

0081_dde73946-111f-4ab0-b02f-b0ce64ef30a1	KING CITY, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Sept. 16, 2015) - TWC Enterprises Limited ("TWC") (TSX:TWC) today announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") has accepted a notice filed by TWC of its intention to make a normal course issuer bid through the facilities of the TSX or alternative Canadian trading platforms.\n\nThe notice provides that TWC may, during the twelve-month period commencing September 20th, 2015 and ending September 19th, 2016 purchase up to 1,337,900 common shares ("Common Shares") in total, being approximately 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares. The price that TWC will pay for any such Common Shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition. Management of TWC will determine the actual number of Common Shares that may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases. \n\nUnder the current normal course issuer bid due to expire September 19, 2015, no Common Shares were purchased for cancellation during the last twelve months. As of September 10, 2015 there were 26,759,182 Common Shares outstanding. TWC average daily trading volume for the prior six months is 2,592. Daily purchases will be limited to 1,000 common shares, other than block purchase exceptions.\n\nTWC believes that its Common Shares have been trading in price ranges which do not adequately reflect their value in relation to the business of TWC and its future business prospects. As a result, depending upon future price movements and other factors, TWC believes that its outstanding Common Shares may represent an attractive investment. Furthermore, the purchases are expected to benefit all persons who continue to hold Common Shares by increasing their proportionate interest in TWC. All Common Shares purchased by TWC under the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled.\n\nCorporate Profile\n\nTWC is engaged in golf club operations under the trade mark, "ClubLink One Membership More Golf." TWC is Canada's largest owner and operator of golf clubs with 54.5 18-hole equivalent championship and six 18-hole equivalent academy courses at 44 locations in Ontario, Quebec and Florida.\n\nTWC is also engaged in rail, tourism and port operations based in Skagway, Alaska, which operate under the trade name "White Pass & Yukon Route."

0083_ca1debc9-1685-4555-8eaf-1a74e8d10fcc	Alex Alexander and his wife Iris Xie.  \nKimberley Diamonds chairman Alex Alexander will not stand down as a director of the company, despite facing court yesterday for allegedly issuing false statements to the Australian sharemarket last year. \n\nMr Alexander did not respond to questions from WestBusiness yesterday about whether he intended to remain as a director of the troubled company. \n\nBut KDL issued a statement this afternoon saying the Russian-born businessman would remain as its chairman with the “unanimous support” of its board. \n\nA statement yesterday from the company noted Mr Alexander denied the allegations and would defend all charges. \n\nKDL’s other board members include executive directors Noel Halgreen - also a director of Mr Alexander’s Sydney stock broking business – and Rodney Sainty. \n\nKDL’s non-executive directors are Yong Xiao and Rupert Baring – who is a fellow director of a Hong Kong-based trading business controlled by Mr Alexander and his wife, Iris Xie. \n\nMr Alexander was arrested early yesterday morning at Sydney airport and charged with four counts of misleading the market over bullish earnings statements issued by the company between October 2013 and March 2014. \n\nHe was not required to enter a plea at a court hearing yesterday, but was ordered to hand over his passport under bail conditions before a November 10 hearing. \n\nEach charge carries a maximum penalty of five years jail and/or a $34,000 fine. \n\nBetween October 2013 and March 2014, KDL told investors it expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $11.5 million to $14 million. \n\nIn that time, KDL shares traded in a 64.5¢ to $1.36 range and it raised $10.8 million at 90¢ a share. In April, it unsuccessfully tried to return to the capital markets, seeking $15 million at $1 a share, but subsequently abandoned the raising. \n\nWhat KDL did not say was that those earnings forecasts were based on an assumption it could win a 30 per cent price rise for the yellow diamonds produced at its Ellendale mine from high-end jeweller Tiffany & Co. \n\nThe Tiffany negotiations ended unsuccessfully in May and KDL was forced to dramatically downgrade its earnings forecast. Its shares plunged 27¢, or 41.5 per cent, to 38¢. \n\nIt is understood ASIC is still investigating the affairs of Kimberley Diamonds, which closed its Ellendale diamond mine on June 30, leaving 100 workers unpaid and trade creditors owed millions more. \n\nToday, KDL shares were up 0.4 cents, or 6.56 per cent, to 6.5 cents shortly before the close of trade.
0084_3805f22a-69e9-40bf-adbf-f0673bf8f17f	The Beckhams \n \nDavid Beckham has "no power" over his daughter. \n \nThe retired soccer star believes he's a push-over when it comes to disciplining four-year-old Harper and is a lot "stricter" on his sons Brooklyn, 16, Romeo, 13, and Cruz, 10. \n \nSpeaking to 'Entertainment Tonight', he said: "I have no power with that little girl - no power whatsoever." \n \nHe added: "I love all my children, of course, equally but I'm definitely stricter with the boys than I am Harper, which gets me in trouble with my wife of course." \n \nHowever, the 40-year-old hunk previously admitted his fashion designer wife Victoria, 41, whom he has been married to for 16 years, is the "strict one in the house." \n \nHowever, they both keep a watchful eye over their eldest son Brooklyn and are able to "control" everything he posts on his social networking sites. \n \nHe explained earlier this month: "Because our 16-year-old son, Brooklyn, has got like four million Instagram followers... we control everything he posts, everything he does, and it's the same with our other kids." \n \nMeanwhile, David is hopeful his children will follow in his footsteps and carve out a career in sport, but only if it's what they want to do and are happy doing so.
0085_3a21b875-9c4a-429e-bf45-0a772dd19cc9	Sept. 14--Two former technology company executives were arrested last week on market manipulation and accounting fraud charges that appear connected to a former Charlotte hedge fund manager already serving time in federal prison. \n \nThe indictment unsealed in Manhattan outlines the role of an unnamed, unindicted hedge fund manager in North Carolina that fits the description of Stephen Maiden, who was sentenced in February to seven years in prison for an investment scheme that cost investors at least $8.9 million. \n \nThe indictment could bolster a civil suit that more than two dozen individuals, mostly in the Carolinas, filed in 2014 against Maiden and his former hedge fund administrator, SS&C Technologies . That case is currently moving forward in N.C. Business Court. \n \nIn last week's indictment in New York, a federal grand jury charged Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, the former chairman and CEO of KIT Digital, with market manipulation and accounting fraud. The company's former chief financial officer, Robin Smyth, was charged with accounting fraud. \n \nKIT Digital, a once publicly traded online video technology company, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2013 after acknowledging accounting errors and irregularities. The company, based in New York, has since emerged from bankruptcy under the name Piksel. \n \nTuzman and Smith no longer work for the company. Tuzman gained attention in 2001 when the former Goldman Sachs banker was featured in a documentary called "Startup.com" about his company govWorks, which became a casualty of the dot-com bubble. \n \nTuzman was arrested in Colombia and Smith in Australia, the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil charges last week against the pair. \n \nN.C. Business Court suit \n \nThe 2014 suit filed by investors against Maiden and SS&C Technologies previously alleged that Maiden had ties to Tuzman, saying they started doing business together in 2008. That suit says Maiden's involvement with Tuzman and two other individuals led to the demise of his fund. \n \nMaiden, Tuzman and the others "came together for the purpose of using their web of companies to engage in self-dealing for their personal benefit," the suit alleges. \n \n[READ MORE: Bilked investors file suit against Maiden] \n \nGary Mauney, the Charlotte attorney representing the investors in the civil suit, said the context in the indictment indicates Maiden is the hedge fund manager listed as "co-conspirator #1." \n \n"The allegations of the complaint and the allegations in the indictment more or less read the same way in terms of some of the underlying transactions going on at the hedge fund," Mauney said. "Certainly the matters that are laid out in the indictment will be part of the discovery in our case, which is ongoing." \n \nThe U.S. Attorney's Office, the SEC and Maiden's attorney, Rick Glaser, declined to comment. \n \nThe indictment alleges that between December 2008 and September 2011, Tuzman and the hedge fund manager engaged in a scheme to artificially inflate the share price and trading volume for KIT Digital's stock. \n \nThe hedge fund manager, at Tuzman's behest, purchased and sold shares of KIT Digital to create the "illusion" of greater trading volume, the indictment alleges. Tuzman invested in the hedge fund and directed KIT Digital to invest in the fund without disclosing this to the public, according to court documents. \n \nThe civil suit in N.C. Business Court also describes an arrangement in which Maiden agreed to invest in KIT Digital shares "to artificially increase the volume of trading" and to "increase the value of" KIT Digital shares. Maiden, in return, received a "secret payment" for making the investments that he did not disclose to investors, the suit says. \n \nFriend, classmates lost money \n \nMaiden, now 42, launched the Maiden Capital Opportunity Fund in 2006 with investments from individuals in Charlotte and elsewhere, according to federal court documents. Hedge funds are loosely regulated investments for the wealthy. \n \nBy February 2009, Maiden had lost a substantial amount of investor funds in a series of failed investments, including in an unnamed "illiquid microcap company," according to court documents. But to keep investors from pulling their money, he began sending out false statements showing that the fund was doing well and making money, court documents allege. By July 2012, Maiden Capital was insolvent. \n \nMaiden's scheme lost money for friends, former business school classmates, neighbors and even groomsmen from his wedding, according to the civil complaint in N.C. Business Court. \n \n[READ MORE: Maiden sentenced to 7 years] \n \nWhen Maiden was sentenced in February, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad and prosecutors acknowledged Maiden had cooperated with an ongoing investigation, including meeting with authorities in New York. Maiden is serving his prison time at a medium-security federal facility in Cumberland, Md. \n \nThe investor suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Maiden and SS&C Technologies. The suit alleges SS&C papered over "accounting infirmities" at the fund and made a choice to stop "documenting and verifying" the fund's assets. \n \nLawyers representing SS&C did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \nRick Rothacker: 704-358-5170, @rickrothacker
0086_5c404c1e-5b70-4276-96d9-56299bc5ffe0	The beauty brand Carol’s Daughter has a new campaign aimed to promote beauty and positive messages about body image among women. It’s called the #BornAndMade campaign, and it’s just as it reads: it’s purpose is to show women that they were born and made beautiful , according to Yahoo! News. \n\nUsing the hashtag #BornAndMade, the campaign asks Instagram users to share images of themselves with their name, where they were born and a personality trait they’re “made with.” Users are also asked to complete the phrase “I am ___’s daughter,” which actually ties back to the company’s beginnings. \n\n"When I needed to come up with a name for our company I decided to come up with a list of things that I was and a list of things I wanted to become ,” founder Lisa Price said on Carol’s Daughter’s Facebook page. “I figured I would affirm something wonderful about myself or call into existence something yet to happen to me. So amongst the things that I was and am was Carol's daughter, I was also Robert's daughter, and at the time Hank's secretary and Gordon's girlfriend. I wanted to become Gordon's wife so I didn't want to affirm the girlfriend position so I picked ‘Carol's daughter.’ It was the one that felt the best, it was the one that made me smile, and that's who I am." \n\nUsers can create their own image on the campaign’s website here . \n\nBut this isn’t the only campaign in recent months that has promoted positive messages about female body image. My colleague Kelsey Dallas reported in May about Dove’s #ChooseBeautiful campaign , which aimed to show that women, even when they’re considered “average” or “normal,” should still be considered beautiful. \n\nBut while Dove’s campaign referred to beauty as a choice, Carol’s Daughter’s message focuses more on how people are born with what makes them beautiful.
0087_b16bb4c6-48b7-4f31-9cbb-12ac162dd9b6	JUNEAU, Alaska - An Alaska woman accused of stealing a police car with her husband handcuffed in the back seat faces several charges including theft and hindering prosecution, troopers said on Friday. \n \nThe woman slipped into the patrol's car and drove off on Wednesday while a state trooper was engaged with a passing motorist on an unrelated topic, a trooper dispatch report said. \n \nAuthorities found the car not far from where it was stolen in Big Lake, a tiny lakeside community of 3,500 people about 65 miles (104 km) northwest of Anchorage. \n \nThe following day troopers arrested Amber Watford, 28, and Joshua Watford 38, in a home about 45 miles (72 km) north of Anchorage in Wasilla, the report said. \n \nJoshua Watford had been first arrested in Big Lake on Wednesday for failure to appear at court-ordered, alcohol-related classes from a previous driving under the influence charge, State Trooper spokeswoman Megan Peters said. \n \nIt was not long after his arrest that Watford's wife made off with the patrol car and the couple remained at-large for about 30 hours, the trooper report said. \n \nNo one else was charged in connection with the incident, Peters said.

0090_0e679a7d-0576-4370-801b-90855d7aadf2	As Rep. Richard　Corcoran　was unanimously designated the next speaker of the Florida House Wednesday, he lived up to his promise to call for controversial reforms aimed at “cleaning up our own house” and policies such as universal school vouchers. \n\n“The enemy is not the special interests. The enemy is not the press. The enemy is not any of that stuff,” Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, told the Republican-controlled chamber. “The enemy has always been and will always be us.” \n\nHe laid out what he said is the truth about elected office in Tallahassee: politicians who campaign on one thing and “do another thing once elected;” elected officials who start seeking higher office as soon as they are sworn in; others who use their office to seek well-paying jobs “which we would never have gotten but for our service;” and others who “pander” to the press, avoid tough decisions and cave “to the special interests.” \n\n“When the political process is more accountable to the people, then, and only then, can we really begin to positively transform the lives of the people in our state,” he said. \n\nHe then ticked off a list of reforms that he said would ideally be changed in law but which he will first pursue by rule: \n\n▪  Create more transparency in government by requiring every lobbyist “to disclose which bills, which amendments and which appropriations they are trying to influence.” \n\n▪  Ban elected officials from taking jobs in government for six years after they leave office to “end the practice of legislators padding their pensions.” \n\n▪  Prohibit legislators from being able to take a job with any company or group that receives any funding from the state to “build an absolute firewall between our private lives and the influence of special interests.” \n\n▪  And close the “revolving door between the Legislature and the lobbying corps” by passing a constitutional amendment that bans legislators from lobbying for six years after they leave office. Corcoran has planned his slate of proposed reforms for years, working with the 28 fellow Republicans who were elected in 2010 with him and drafting them in a document he calls “The Manifesto.” \n\nAs he spoke, he was greeted with both polite applause and standing ovations from his GOP brethren, even though many of his reforms seemed targeted at them. \n\nIn the front row was a lineup of former House speakers — Democrat Lee Moffitt, Republicans Tom Feeney, Larry Cretul and Will Weatherford. All but Weatherford have registered to lobby the Legislature before the six-year window Corcoran seeks. \n\nWhile Corcoran made no mention of his “manifesto,” he explained that the changes must go beyond process and focus on broad reforms — in the education system, the justice system, and the judiciary. \n\nCorcoran stopped short of calling for universal education vouchers but called for lawmakers to “fully fund the right of all parents to choose what school best meets their child’s needs — regardless of whether it’s public or private, religious or secular, or home school or virtual school.” \n\nTaking aim at the Florida Supreme Court, which has ruled that offering every parent education vouchers violates the constitution, Corcoran called for 12-year term limits for all judges. \n\n He called for criminal justice “metrics” that show which criminals are getting the harshest and longest sentences, and he called for safeguards “to guarantee that justice in this state is never governed by the color of a person’s skin or the size of their wallet.” \n\nAnd Corcoran, who has spent his four years in office opposing Medicaid expansion and Obamacare, derided the “two-tiered health care system” and the state system that protects hospital profits at the expense of the poor. \n\n“It’s time people realized that conservatives aren’t against health care for poor people, we’re against giving them poorly run government health care,” he said, as his House members applauded but many Senate Republicans — notably Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando — remained seated. \n\nFinally, he called on his colleagues to “serve a purpose greater than ourselves” and “sacrifice our own interests” telling the story of Jack Mashburn, a distant relative of his wife’s, who in 1952 as a 22-year-old legislator changed the law that banned blacks from the beach only to be told by the racist leaders of his Panama City town that he’d be voted out of office. \n\n“Either you hear that story as a cautionary tale, or you hear it how I hear it — as a story of a person who put principle over politics,” he said. “…We can stand and fight, regardless of the cost, regardless of the consequences, regardless of the opposition.” \n\n Both friends and rivals commended Corcoran for his call to action, but many also doubted he would succeed. \n\nRep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, who will be the House Democratic Leader in 2016. called Corcoran’s ideas “a very aggressive agenda.” But she opposes putting term limits on judges and, having worked in a public defender’s office, she has questions about whether it’s a good idea to ban lawmakers from accepting jobs in government. \n\nAnd on the same week Corcoran was urging independence from the special interests, the political committee he runs to re-elect Republicans was hosting nearly a dozen fundraisers in Tallahassee to collect checks from special interests and lobbyists. \n\n“I commend him for wanting to step outside the boundaries of Tallahassee and tackle the problem,” said Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano, Corcoran’s friend of 30 years who spent 19 years in the Legislature and attended the speech. “But you can’t go up there and say we’re going to overhaul the influence of special interests and then five minutes later take a check from those same special interests. If he wants to lead, he has not start with himself and he has to start now.” \n\nCorcoran responded that he knows there will be cynics and doubters but he believes there are legislators who want to give it a try. “It’s confront the brutal facts, and the brutal fact is ... man is flawed and if left to their own devices, they’re going to try to seek their self-interest,’’ he said. \n\nMiami Herald staff writer Kristen M. Clark contributed to this report.
0091_2154d3bc-4aaf-40e8-a8f5-0395fd3708d5	Dallas star Linda Gray has said she is happy to live her life as a single woman. \n \nShe told Hello! magazine: “A lot of women are content on their own and don’t want a partner. They want their freedom. We all love to flirt, it doesn’t mean you’re going to bring the person home or have a sleepover.” \n (Hello! Magazine/PA)  \nShe also spoke about her previous marriage of 21 years to art director Ed Thrasher and her struggle to live her dream of being an actress. \n \n“I don’t like the word abusive because he was just living the life he knew how to live,” she says. \n \n“He was a creative guy and part of his dream was that he wanted to be a cowboy and run a ranch with horses, so when the children were little, we moved out here (to the house they designed and built together) and he had his horses and chickens. \n \n“Then when I announced I wanted to live my dream, the answer was, ‘No. You’ll become an actor when the children are in college.’ I thought, ‘My God, we’re living his dream, but what about mine?’ Of course, women stayed at home and raised their children – that was the way it was – but I was like, ‘Is that all there is?’.” \n (Hello! Magazine/PA) \nShe says landing the role of Sue Ellen Ewing in Dallas “opened so many doors, philosophies and ideas”. \n \n“All of us – Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, myself – were unemployed actors who happened to get a job and that job was Dallas. We had no idea it was going to be successful, so we were like, ‘Oh, here we are, trying the best we can’.” \n \nHer co-star, Hagman, famous for playing JR Ewing, died in November 2012. \n \n“We laughed every day,” she said. “Every day was different and funny. He was a born entertainer. There was just magic that happened between us. You know when you meet someone and feel like you’ve known them forever? That’s what it was like.” \n   \n Share article  \n   \nRead the full article in Hello! out now.
0092_6ef64365-9955-4493-9ea1-f5a50732c82a	THIRTY YEARS ago former farmer and publican David Robinson started an event that began behind the village pub where he was landlord. \n\nWhen it takes place again next weekend it will be spread across 85 acres, will include everything from steam rollers to fairground organs, traction engines, vintage tractors, cars and motorcycles and will see an attendance of over 7,000 across its two days. \n\nThe Hunton Steam Gathering has become a major part of the autumn show calendar between Bedale and Leyburn but David didn’t envision what it has become. It was a combination of his love of machines and particularly vintage tractors, a move back to the village where he was born and a meeting with the then chairman of the parish council that set the wheels in motion.\n\n“My wife Pauline and I had bought a small farm at Exelby just south of Bedale in 1976 where we had some Jersey cows providing milk for local people to come and collect, a herd of Large White X Landrace sows that at their peak reached 40 and a flock of sheep, but by 1984 we had decided that lambing sheep in snowstorms was enough for us and that we’d be better off inside in the winter months. We sold up and bought the pub in Hunton that was then called The Oddfellows Arms, which we renamed The Countryman’s Inn.\n\n“There’d been a piece of land donated to the parish council to make a children’s play area and Mrs Edie Todd, the parish council chairman, spoke with me about the need to raise money for equipment such as swings and slides. \n\n“I rang around trying to find out how much everything would cost and she nearly fainted when I told her the figure would be something like £5,000. I think she thought it was a nonstarter but I said that I’d see what I could do with my contacts on the vintage machinery side and that maybe we could hold an open day and raise some money.\n\n“Right from the 1960s I’d had vintage tractors and I’d brought my collection of them with me to the pub. I spoke with a few friends and we ended up with about 25 exhibits that first year in 1985. We had tractors, vintage cars and stationary engines. I also gathered up some people who made walking sticks plus a Morris dancing group. Our total cost for putting on that event in the first year was £108 and we made £1,000 profit, which meant that work could start on the play area.”\n\nThe Gathering has since raised thousands of pounds every year for other village needs such as a footbridge over the beck and has given to many charities. It moved to a larger location 15 years ago on the edge of the village.\n\n“As the show grew we borrowed lots of other little fields behind the pub and one of the fascinations people had was that we had different sections in separate walled fields. Eventually we had to move and we’re now grateful to Mr and Mrs Worsdale and Messrs Chapman who both allow us to use their farmland for the exhibits and the ploughing match that we started in 2007.”\n\nDavid and Pauline retired from The Countryman’s Inn in 2001 and now live in the nearby village of Great Fencote David’s passion for vintage machinery remains as firm as ever.\n\n“I’ve always been around machinery. My father Bill was a mechanic who became a haulage contractor and then bought a farm in North Cowton in 1957. \n\n“I was a wagon driver, delivering animal feed for Teesside Farmers in Darlington that became Farmway and then moved on to plant hire. I then bought my own wagon. \n\n“The first vintage tractor I ever bought was an Allis Chalmers Model B. I tossed a coin over whether I would pay £10 or £7 10s and I won. \n\n“I’ve now got five Allis Chalmers tractors amongst the 21 I have here. My dad used to repair them so we knew them well. I’ve some Internationals and Fordsons too. \n\n“My pride and joy would have to be an International W4 that was imported from Canada.

In every change He faithful will remain.” (Be Still My Soul from the Song Book of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (LDS) page # 124) \n \nAs I sang those four lines at the opening of Sacrament meeting last Sunday, I was brought to tears and could not sing any further. I had been experiencing a lengthy struggle with the adversary over the last six months and that was the message I received from on high. \n \nThis message is for everyone as Satan will tempt us with the weaknesses we know best in ourselves. Whether it is the feeling of worthlessness, running faster than we are able or beating ourselves up that we are not the best at everything, (whatever it is), this physical manifestation of our own weaknesses will drag us down to depression; the kind of depression that is debilitating and scarring. \n \nSatan wants us to lose.  He wants us to be unsuccessful especially in sharing and helping others in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Whether a single person, single parent, married parent, grandparent or aunt or uncle, we are righteous spiritual beings all working towards the same finish: to raise righteous children, do the Lord’s work on earth and help others.   \n \nWe know that our God will not leave us without a rope to climb or an open window to escape, we are His children and He loves us. An LDS priesthood leader, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf tells us: “Our destiny is not determined by the number of times we stumble but by the number of times we rise up, dust ourselves off, and move forward.” \n \nBy the same token we are given weaknesses to be humbled and turn these same weaknesses to strengths. We read from the ancient prophet Ether who wrote: (Ether 12: 27-28) \n \n“And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them. \n \nBehold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all righteousness.” How can we forget these beautiful messages? When we are in the midst of our weaknesses or struggles, the task at hand can be so difficult that we forget the love of our Heavenly Father. We forget our purpose and how to fight back against Satan. We forget that we are strong and should not get sucked into a pity party for ourselves which leaves us depressed and useless. \n To read more of Valerie’s articles, click here.  \nTwo years ago a movie was released to the theater which used this catch phrase: “Remember who your enemy is.” This statement had a profound effect on both me and my friend who saw the movie. We talked about how this catch phrase can help us realize how the adversary can over take our purpose and happiness. If we could only remember who our enemy is the battle would soon be won.  We have the tools of our scriptures, prayer and encouragement of our religious leaders to keep us safe from the enemy. We have the “whole armor of God” which in Ephesians says “…may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” (Ephesians 6:11) We have our families and good friends who love us and can remind us of our blessings and the importance of keeping the faith. Be still and know that God loves us and wants the best for us.
0094_9390fb7b-6b2a-400e-b2bc-7e00b2c4d40c	The Denver Broncos beat the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday, with Peyton Manning leading the team to a scoring drive in the final minutes. \nThe Denver Broncos prevailed over the AFC West rival Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday, winning 31-24. It was a rough game for Peyton Manning, throwing another pick-six and taking multiple hits at the hands of an aggressive Chiefs defense. But he ultimately led the team down to a game-tying drive in the final minutes and a timely fumble by the Chiefs was returned for a touchdown, avoiding overtime and giving them the win.\n\nIt was an ugly game from the onset. There were four sacks, seven penalties and no points in the first quarter of play alone. There was also a bad fumble from Kansas City running back Jamaal Charles after a long drive that would have likely ended in points for the Chiefs. It didn't get any prettier from there, as the Chiefs lost a fumble at the beginning of the second quarter, giving Denver the ball in Kansas City territory.\n\nBut offenses didn't really prevail in this one, and after a successful fourth-and-1 was converted and then called back due to a timeout before the snap, the Broncos failed to convert and the Chiefs took over again.\n\nPoints weren't on the board until Denver shot themselves in the foot multiple times on defense. They were called for a pair of unnecessary roughness penalties, which advanced the Chiefs a total of 30 yards. That opened the door for Charles to take one 34 yards to the house for the first points of the game.\n\nThe scoring was rapid from there, with Kansas City putting up another touchdown after a Manning interception, and they seemed to have all the momentum before Manning threw a couple of touchdown passes in the span of a couple minutes to tie the game heading into the second half. Neither scored again until the Chiefs put together a scoring drive with under three minutes to go in the game. The Broncos followed it up with a touchdown of their own with under a minute to go.\n\nFrom there, the Chiefs had that costly fumble, which was returned for a touchdown, and they were unable to do anything with the remaining 27 seconds on the clock.\n\nManning had a pretty significant career milestone on Thursday, reaching 70,000 career passing yards. He needed just 134 on the day to reach the market, and he got that and then some. Manning finished completing 26 of 45 passes for 256 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.\n\nDenver only managed 61 yards on the ground, with Ronnie Hillman putting up 34 of them. Jamaal Charles led the way for Kansas City with 125 yards and a touchdown, but he also had that fumble. Alex Smith completed 16 of 25 passes for 191 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions.\n3 things we learned from Thursday's game\nThese pass rushers are pretty good\n\nJust in case you weren't aware, there were some pretty good pass rushers on Thursday. DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller were obviously the headline for Denver, and Justin Houston provided the pass-rushing oomph for the Chiefs. It was a bad game for quarterbacks, especially in the first half. Manning was under assault for much of the game and had to throw balls quicker than he'd have liked, while Smith didn't have much more luck himself. Both teams logged two sacks in the first half, with Denver adding another four quarterback hits and Kansas City adding three.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThat kind of thing was pretty much happening all night long.\nManning is still struggling\n\nManning didn't have a great game in his debut against the Baltimore Ravens, throwing for just 175 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. That pick also was returned for a touchdown. On Thursday, he didn't look great from the onset, and then this happened:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe pressure was in Manning's face, and he had to throw that ball well before he wanted to and the timing with his receiver just wasn't there. That was Marcus Peters securing the interception and the touchdown. Manning did find his groove and did eventually put points on the board for Denver, but it was another rough start for a player who can't have a lot left in the tank.\nSometimes your first instinct is the right one\n\nAt the beginning of the second quarter, the Broncos forced a fumble on De'Anthony Thomas, giving Denver the ball in Kansas City territory. They didn't get the first down after a handful of plays, and found themselves in a fourth-and-1 situation. It's unclear if Denver head coach Gary Kubiak second-guessed himself or what, but Denver ran a play, a run to CJ Anderson that successfully picked up the first down, keeping the drive alive. Look at it here:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nBut the play was called back because the Broncos took a timeout before the beginning of the play, and the whistles came in late. So it went back to fourth-and-1, the Broncos tried another run to the other direction and this one wasn't even close to being converted. They turned the ball over to the Chiefs, who went on to put the first points of the game on the board on the ensuing drive.

0097_f9d4ece1-7e7a-4937-b200-6b46be42b80c	The LAPD is awaiting word on whether federal money will help fund body-worn cameras for officers, after the American Civil Liberties Union asked the Department of Justice to halt funding this month because videos will largely be kept from the public. \n \nCurrent allocation plans seek federal funds for about 10 percent of the camera purchases. Has Chief Charlie Beck contacted the DOJ the challenge the ACLU's position?   \n \nPlus, after a violent summer in South L.A., the homicide rate is up about seven percent in Los Angeles. How is the LAPD responding to residents' fears? And a scam alert from LAPD warns of phone calls claiming a family member is being held hostage for ransom. The calls are originating from Mexico. \n \nWe'll have more details on that and other crime and safety developments. \n Interview Highlights  \nLet’s talk about body cameras because LAPD rolling them out, you got them in the Valley, with other areas to come. But the ACLU has asked the Feds not to give any more money toward the department’s body cameras because you’re not making the footage available immediately in officer-involved shootings. Your response to tht? \n  \nWell, the ACLU is  welcome to offer whatever recommendations they want to whoever they want, but I don’t agree with them, I don’t think the federal government will agree with them either. Body cameras, and I’m wearing one right now as we talk and you can see it, are an evidence-collection tool, just like detectives are, just like the coroner’s investigation is, just like many many pieces of an investigation. We don’t release investigations piecemeal. Body camera footage is available for review by the district attorney, by the city attorney, by a civil court, by a criminal court, and in cases of uses of force that rise to the appropriate level, by the civilian police commission. So there are multiple levels of review, and to merely put video into the public without further investigatory information I think is inapprpriate. \n  \nOf course, the concern is that the department is going to release the video when it suits its interests, not so quick to do so when it makes the department the gatekeeper. How do you respond to that concern? \n  \nI respond to it by looking at my track record. I’ve been Chief for five years now. We’ve had in-car video for that whole time, and I haven’t released that video when it supports my position or when it is detrimental to my position or to the department. I use it as part of the investigation; it is not something I use to form public opinion. It’s an investigative tool. That is not to say that I would never release video. If the state of the city depends on it, then that would weigh heavily on my decision. But in the day-to-day incidents of policing. One of the things I like to remind folks is that when you call the Los Angeles Police Department, it’s not on your best day. It never is. We go to your house. There may have been a domestic incident. You may have been the victim of a crime. It could be any number of circumstances. None of which you want put in the public domain. At least, all of the victims I’ve ever talked to. And so we want to be very circumspect, we want to be the guardians of the public trust. When people interact with the police, I think they have a right to some privacy in that ondition. \n  \nI wanted to ask you about the rollout of the body cameras and whether you’ve had glitches with them so far. I know there was the pilot run of them, but now with more officers having them, how’s it going \n  \nSo far it’s gone very well. Obviously it’s a learned, physical skill. It’s just like taking your seatbelt off, or any other thing you learn by repetition. The activation of the body camera, the deactivation of the body camera. Learning the appropriate times. Remembering to do it under stressful circumstances. All of that has to become muscle memory to the officer. So they’re working on that, and we’re working on some certain other minor things. But nothing of anyimport. \n  \nI was talking with an officer who was engaged in a pursuit, caught a suspect, and he forgot to turn on his camera before he took off. So he got sent for retraining. Very frustrating for him, just saying, “It’s yet another thing we got to remember when we’re looking out for our safety, trying to catch someone, make sure the camera’s on.” Are you seeing as they’re getting used to doing this very many instances where they simply forget to turn on thecamera? \n  \nWell it happens. We forget a number of things; sometimes people forget to put the car in park, under stressful circumstances. They try to get out without taking their seatbelt off. They leave some of their equipment in the car. Human beings, and you know, we’re all human beings, have a lot of emotion and a lot of adrenaline running through their systems in stressful circumstances. And sometimes it can be hard to cognitively remember to do things. That’s why it has to be muscle memory, that’s why it’s so important to do it daily, to remember it, to do it in a way that’s consistent so that it becomes part of your day-to-day actions. So as we see that happen, we will see it being less and less of an issue. But it’s always going to happen because in those circumstances in where we’re the most interested in what the body camera collects, those are the most stressful cicumstances. \n  \nWell and you know there are going to be times, as we said before, it’s going to glitch because technology is not foolproof. There’s going to be times officers truly forget to turn it on, not just that they’re trying to  avoid being seen doing something. It’s always going to raise the suspicion that the officer or the department did something to keep it from being recoded. \n  \nWell I think that’s why it’s important to have the discussion we’re having now. To recognize that, 1) it is not the totality of the evidence. To be perfectly frank, the autopsy results, the ballistic results, the forensic results, the trace evidence results, often paint a much more concretely prosecutable or understandable picture than a body camera does because they are science where the body camera is going to capture what it captures. Like I say, it’s like the young kids watching a baseball game through a knothole; you only see what you see. And the body camera doesn’t collect everything. But it’s a great evidence collection tool, it will add to our ability to analyze incidents. I’m excited about it, I think it’s going to be something that is a game changerin policing.  \n  Guest:  \nCharlie Beck , Chief, Los Angeles Police Department
0098_b01e74d0-de83-4be0-9215-bef4e665e7ba	To the editor — For decades the federal government has been dipping into our Social Security funds for purposes other than what they were earmarked. President Obama transferred $716 billion of Medicare funds to Obamacare. As U.S. citizens, the children of illegal immigrants (our fastest growing and poorest population) have access to our resources. But it is our senior citizens being blamed for these programs’ instability and paying the consequences. \n \nTaxpayers are paying for the subsidies and child development for the poor and paying higher cost for health care to cover those insured through the Affordable Care Act. \n \nWhile state government is trying to shrink classroom size, schools are “struggling to education an increasing number of children who don’t speak much — or any — English,” according a Seattle Times article published in the Aug. 11 Yakima Herald-Republic. I also reference a photo on Page 1B that day: “Dance in Wapato like they do in Mexico.” Is this Americans’ resources at work? \n\nGovernment is allowing the poor (who have not had to make any sacrifices of their own) to squander our resources as a means to increase the size of their poor families. How long can America sustain them?
0099_94d91a1f-ab62-4643-8be0-9578a0138275	Sure, it’s an additional gigabyte of RAM and Bluetooth 4.2 however these features don’t lead to any existence-altering experience. The brand new software methods will quickly trickle lower towards the older Universe S6 and S6 Edge concerning can not be any sort of new hardware they need. This raises the advantage screen, that has grown in dimensions but nonetheless has limited utility. Additionally, there are the truth that Samsung has cast off the IR blaster for whatever reason, that is a shame as it is an opportune feature to possess. \n \nCut to the current and we’ve two new inclusions in the flagship Universe series – the Universe S6 Edge+ and also the Universe Note 5. Both stick to the same design language the S6 family set, also it appears as if Samsung will iterate about this formula for some time. Unlike the Universe Note Edge (Review), the Universe S6 Edge+ isn’t a companion towards the Universe Note 5 and does not have the special features such as the S Pen. Today, we’ll talk about the Universe S6 Edge+, which, initially, seems to become only a bigger Universe S6 Edge. The same is true it justify the (approximate) Rs 9000 premium over its more compact brother or sister? Let us discover. \n \n\n \nVerdict \nWe have old that Samsung did an admirable job using the Universe S6 Edge, and also the same is true for that S6 Edge+. The hardware and software updates result in the phone a little more future-proof however that comes in a rather steep cost. The telephone is roughly Rs 9000 more costly than its more compact brother or sister, so we don’t really see what extra value it provides to warrant this. So far as we are able to tell, there is not much – it’ll just appeal more to individuals who choose really large phones. \n \nOn top, we’ve the Nano-SIM tray along with a microphone for noise cancellation. What’s missing this is actually the infrared (IR) blaster that is present around the Universe S6 Edge. We are unsure why Samsung made the decision to depart it. At the base, there is the headset socket, Micro-USB port, and speaker grille. Flipping the unit over, we are able to begin to see the 16-megapixel camera, Brought expensive, and heart-rate sensor around the rear. You may also observe that our review unit were built with a ‘Made in India by Samsung’ inscription at the end. \n \n\n \nMicrosoft applications like Word, Stand out, Ms powerpoint, OneNote, Skype and OneDrive come pre-loaded. There is also 100GB of OneDrive cloud space for storage free for 2 years. Other software additions are available in your camera application, which we’ll enter into within the next section. \n \nLive Broadcast, another new addition, basically allows you livestream your phone’s screen contents to some YouTube funnel. You are able to set the stream as private or public, with respect to the content. However, video resolution here’s seriously restricted to WQVGA (426×240). \n \n\n \nAudio quality is excellent however the stock earphones neglect to highlight this. The wireless earbuds don’t offer much when it comes to ambient noise isolation because they don’t block your ears completely. The speaker is just moderately noisy, but Samsung’s notification tones come through noticeably enough. It is also too simple to hide the speaker grille when holding the telephone with you for gaming, which muffles audio further, though this really is much more of a pain than the usual serious drawback. \n \nFeel and look \nThe S6 Edge+ scores large within the appearance department because it looks simply stunning from the position. The Silver Titanium finish looks particularly good in daylight and it is certain to grab eyeballs. Samsung uses 7000-series aluminium for that chassis, much like Apple’s new apple iphone 6s and also the answers are superb. The telephone feels very sturdy and rigid but additionally delicate, meaning that you simply intuitively start to handle it with special care. That’s mainly because of the curved display, which leaves little room for grip. One for reds aftereffect of all of this metal and glass would be that the phone is extremely slippery and never simple to hold, for instance inside a crowded bus or train. \n \n\n \nPerformance \nThe Samsung Universe S6 Edge+ is definitely an absolute scorcher -when it comes to both performance and warmth generation. The telephone is blazing fast and did not skip a beat even if multitasking between heavy applications for example a game title and also the camera. The painful lag connected with TouchWiz has become a factor of history. The fingerprint scanner works a lot better than it did around the Universe S5 and a straightforward touch is what is needed to unlock the telephone. The phone runs taxing three dimensional games effortlessly however the consequence quite a bit of warmth. First, the region round the Samsung logo design around the back begins heating up, after which it propagates right side close to the energy button. We observed this after playing Angry Wild birds 2 for approximately a quarter-hour. Warmth only grew to become an problem for all of us when doing offers, and also the Universe S6 Edge+ only got warm at the best doing other things. \n \nHow big the display may be the only major physical alternation in the Universe S6 Edge+, in comparison towards the Universe S6 Edge. It sports a 5.7-inch Super Amoled screen having a 1440×2560 resolution, which will keep the pixel density well above 500ppi. The display is simply stunning, creating inky shades of black and saturated colours for viewing any kind of content. \n \n\n \nThe Universe S6 Edge+ isn’t a bad phone at all however it is not the wisest buy at its current cost of Rs 55,500. If you’ll want a curved-screen phone, we advise the Universe S6 Edge over its more recent brother or sister. The different options are the equivalent money and obtain the 64GB version with lots of change remaining for any wireless charging pier along with a wise cover. Should you just enjoy getting the most recent and finest toy to demonstrate, then your Universe Note 5 is really a more good choice. It’s less costly featuring an S Pen stylus, which allows much more helpful functions than this phone’s curved screen. \n \nThe amount rocker and energy button have good tactile feedback and are simple to achieve. The sensors, notification Brought, earpiece and 5-megapixel camera sit over the screen, as the home button using its integrated fingerprint scanner and also the capacitive Back and Recents buttons are put below it. We love to how Samsung has elevated the house button and used another texture to really make it simple to hit around the otherwise glossy panel. \n      \nThe big 3000mAh battery handled to continue for 14 hrs and seven minutes within our video loop test. This really is greater than exactly what the more compact Universe S6 Edge brother or sister handled, that is not surprisingly. We discovered that battery would last nearly one full day’s regular usage which involved doing offers, while using camera, making calls, and hearing music for moderate intervals. \n \n\n \nSearching at some amounts, we’ve got 67,401 points in AnTuTu and 24,060 points in 3DMark IceStorm Limitless. They are excellent scores and other alike as to the the Universe S6 Edge accomplished. Call quality was top-notch without any difficulties with dropped calls, and our unit easily locked onto Airtel’s 4G network where available. \n \nSamsung’s new design philosophy for flagship mobile phones has gotten only praise around the world. The days are gone of excessive chrome, plastic and fake leather – the brand new Samsung is developed and complicated. Roughly six several weeks ago, the organization released the Universe S6 and Universe S6 Edge, that have been such popular that Samsung had trouble maintaining. To satisfy the voracious appetite of customers, Samsung started manufacturing its two flagships in industrial facilities across twenty nations, and India was among the selected ones. \n \n\n \nThe Universe S6 Edge+ has excellent weight distribution because of which, the telephone doesn’t feel heavy. However, the bigger curved display and narrow sides get this to phone very challenging use with one hands- nearly impossible in lots of situations. There’s an excellent possibility of you shedding the telephone in the event you attempt to do this. Overall, ergonomics might have been better and it’ll take getting accustomed to holding this phone literally by its edges. \n \nSince the Universe S5, Samsung’s cameras happen to be key selling points because of its flagships, which is true despite the S6 Edge+. You launch your camera application rapidly by double-tapping the house button. You will find multiple effects to select from in addition to options for example Auto HDR and a number of scene modes. The brand new addition here’s Professional mode. This provides a column of toggle switches around the suitable for Whitened Balance, ISO, Shutter Speed, and concentrate. The alterations you are making could be observed in real-time so you are aware how one last picture will appear. Samsung also provides you with the choice to ‘Save as RAW’ in Professional mode, that is nice if you wish to have the ability to make professional edits afterwards. Actually, each RAW file is all about 30MB each so you could discover yourself drained of space rather rapidly. \n \nAround the software front, you receive Samsung’s TouchWiz interface on the top of Android Lollipop 5.1.1 out-of-the-box. The S6 Edge+ will get some subtle changes and couple of additional features in comparison to the brothers and sisters. The typical suite of Samsung applications like the Gear application, S Health, S Voice, SideSync, Universe Application store and S Planner are present. Additionally for this, we obtain the choice to make use of Tap&ampPay within the NFC menu, which is helpful once Samsung comes out its ‘Samsung Pay’ mobile payment system in India. \n \n\n \nThe S6 Edge+ is presently only accessible with 32GB of onboard storage without any microSD slot for expansion. This should not be considered a large problem for most of us, though should you intend on shooting lots of 4K videos (why is this so) or desire to carry your whole music library around, you’ll exhaust space rather rapidly. USB OTG is an excellent method of growing the onboard storage. \n \nThe Advantage screen sub-menu allows you personalize, well, the advantage. You are able to position a tab on each side from the screen and rapidly access any five contacts and applications of the selecting by swiping on it. Evening Clock is really a handy feature which teaches you time, alarm some time and battery level across the edge. Edge Lighting and individuals Edge works best for individuals contacts that you have put into the advantage screen. Information Stream allows you manage feeds along with other general notices from applications. You are able to download more feeds in the application store. Theme support is yet another fantastic aspect which allows you alter the whole appearance of your Universe S6 Edge+. \n \n(Click to determine full-size images) \n \n\n \n(Click to determine full-size images) \n \nCamera performance is excellent, regardless of lighting condition. Shirt is nicely saturated and the amount of detail is amazing, even if zoomed in. Optical image stabilisation (OIS) does an excellent job of eliminating undesirable shakes, and video quality is fairly stunning, even just in low-light. \n \nSpecifications and software \nThe specifications are virtually just like individuals from the Universe S6 (Review) and Universe S6 Edge (Review), which we have covered in-depth within their reviews. New updates include Bluetooth 4.2 (rather than 4.1) along with a bigger serving of RAM, that can bring the entire to 4GB. It’s difficult to inform when the additional RAM makes any immediate effect on performance once we did not notice any major distinction between this and also the S6 Edge with daily usage. However, as the application data develops and Android receives updates down the road, the extra gigabyte might end up being helpful. \n \nSamsung Universe S6 Edge+ in pictures \n \nThe post appeared first on News List Online .

"We have seen a whole series of initiatives that the government has taken on the ground but there is a long way to go," Naushad Forbes, president-designate of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said yesterday. \n \nDuring an interaction at Atlantic Council, a top American think-tank, Forbes, who is currently leading an industry delegation to the US, observed that more steps needs to be taken to make India an investment friendly destination.Referring to some of the recent announcements taken for Foreign Direct Investment in India, Forbes said there is a huge potential in manufacturing sector both from the growth perspective and inclusion perspective."This is just starting down now," he said.Goods and Services Tax (GST), one of the key issues for economic reforms, he said, has been talked about for a long period of time. "We have great confidence that it (GST) would pass in the next couple of months," Forbes said, adding that according to CII estimates, this would result in increase in India's GDP.CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said the seven per cent growth rate achieved last quarter could be impressive by international standards, but not by Indian standards. "This is much below what we want to grow. We want to grow at 10 per cent. For this we want the manufacturing to grow 10-15 per cent," he said.The potential of India US trade, he argued, is huge. It is time, India and US moved from a buyer-seller relationship to those of co-production and co-development.Banerjee said India is now a land of opportunities and it is for the US companies to take benefit of it.CMD of Cadila Pharmaceuticals Rajiv Modi said the Indian Intellectual Property Rights regime is compliant with World Trade Organization.Observing that India is one of the largest producers of generic medicines, thus providing affordable medical care to people around the globe, he said India and the US can use their capabilities in the pharmaceutical sectors take the bilateral relationship to a new level.(PTI)
0104_7030f935-cab4-48c6-a6a0-f09c61636d9e	Day 3 (Thurs) - not really a first, but something I dread doing.\nMaking a difficult phone call:  I hate making phone calls.  I have pushed tasks like this onto my husband for the past several years and I have embraced texting whole-heartedly because of my aversion to making talking on the phone.\nMy reasons are good:\n** I can't see the persons face I'm talking to and can't judge reactions.  (I need to be able to read a person).  Like, how do I know if they think something I've said is really stupid?\n** My ear gets really hot and sweaty on the phone - well, the iPhone - and I'm afraid it will combust.  I'm sure that's happened to somebody, somewhere.  Don't i phones cause ear cancer??  :/\n** I love procrastinating.  Ok, that one's a lie, but when a phone call is the task at hand, I am an excellent procrastinator.\n** Awkward silences.  This one is the worst.   Hello?  Are you still there?  Are you watching a movie?  Going to the bathroom?  Ugh!  I think someone needs to invent a sensor on your phone that will fill in the awkward silences with music or sound effects;  can I have a good drum roll please?\n    Okay, back to the story....  I needed to make some phone calls to the university where my daughter will be attending.  After going to a year of college, she decided to serve an 18 month mission for the LDS church and she will be returning home in time for winter semester.  She was able to defer scholarships, etc, but she needed my help to find housing, talk to her coach, and make sure her financial stuff is in order.  Great, that means I get to talk to several people I don't know and one track coach that I've only met a few times.\n   And so, I went to my desk with all her info in hand (which was no small task to get together), my computer and phone ready and  gathered courage.  And I just DID IT!  It took me a few sessions of an hour each, but I felt pretty dang proud of myself for doing it.  I even got some applause from my husband (who supports me in (nearly) everything I do) when he overheard me talking on the phone!  It really wasn't as hard as I'd built up in my mind, but I just haven't been able to like the phone much.  Even now.\n    Lesson learned?  Getting those unpleasant jobs done can be a cleansing experience.

Herald-Leader staff photo by Pablo Alcala. \n \nAt 48, Kim Davis is the right age to have been infused with  Rocky III  theme  Eye of the Tiger  as a go-to psych-up anthem. But members of Survivor, the band that wrote and recorded the 1982 hit, are none too happy that the song played Tuesday as the embattled Rowan County Clerk was released from jail, where she had been confined on a contempt of court charge . \n \n“I was very surprised and dismayed at the misuse of the song I co-wrote with Frankie Sullivan for Rocky III ,” Survivor co-founder and song co-writer Jim Peterik said in a statement to Billboard magazine . “The song has motivated thousands through the years to reach beyond their limits. Its use for the release of Kim Davis does not support my views or my politics. I have contacted my publishers to make sure this usage is stopped immediately.” \n \nSurvivor frontman Sullivan took to Facebook to say, “NO! We did not grant Kim Davis any rights to use ( The Eye Of The Tiger ). I would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!” \n \nTMZ reported the band is considering legal action . \n \nDavis has refused to issue marriage licenses since a United States Supreme Court ruling in June legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. She said issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples conflicted with her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian.  She was jailed on Thursday after refusing to comply with Federal Judge David Bunning’s order to issue marriage licenses or allow her staff to issue them. \n \nThe situation has garnered nationwide attention, and Tuesday, Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz both went to Grayson, where Davis was being held, to rally for her support. Huckabee was on stage with Davis when she was released, and Survivor’s iconic anthem played. \n \nIt is far from the first time bands have gotten in disputes with political figures over their music being played at rallies. Recently Neil Young and Donald Trump have been in a dispute over Republican presidential candidate Trump’s use of Young’s  Rockin’ in the Free World  at campaign events. \n \nClick here for more on the Kim Davis situation from Kentucky.com .
0106_b5b74b21-77c3-4511-905f-39bdb0b0f93b	Carly Fiorina has a message for Donald Trump: Yes, "look at this face." \n \nThe former Hewlett-Packard CEO kicked off her speech Friday night to the National Federation of Republican Women in Phoenix by offering a clear rebuttal of Trump's recently quoted comments on her in which he criticized her looks. \n\n"Ladies, look at this face," Fiorina said, to strong applause. "This is the face of a 61-year-old woman. I am proud of every year and every wrinkle." \n\nFiorina didn't call out Trump by name on Friday night, but her remarks were tailored to the receptive, women-dominated crowd. \n\n"Look at all of your faces," Fiorina said, according to video posted online. "The face of leadership. The face of leadership in our party, the party of women's suffrage. The face of leadership in your communities, in your businesses, in your places of work and worship. Ladies, note to Democrat Party: We are not a special interest group, we are the majority of the nation." \n\nFiorina's comments were in light of remarks Trump made in a Rolling Stone profile published this week when he reacted to seeing her appear on TV. \n\n"Look at that face!" Trump said. "Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president." \n\nHe has since explained the remarks by saying he was talking about Fiorina's persona, not her looks, and that he made comments about women "as an entertainer." \n\nThe only woman running in the GOP field, Fiorina has made an effort to speak to women to counter-balance Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and the Democrats' calls of a "war on women" by the Repubilcan Party. \n\nIn fact, Clinton was the only candidate Fiorina called out by name on Friday. \n\n"I have met more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton, but I didn't do photo ops, I did business. And charity. And policy work," Fiorina said, saying a leader must understand and navigate the world. \n\nShe also noted that a leader must understand technology. \n\n"And no, Mrs. Clinton, you do not wipe a server with a towel," she said. \n\nFriday night, Fiorina delivered a speech full of her usual talking points but tailored to her audience. \n\nCalling out Democratic messaging, she said women care about a range of issues, just like men do. \n\n"I personally am so tired of hearing about women's issues. Every issue is a woman's issue," Fiorina said. \n\nBut she also drew anecdotes from her own biography, rising through the ranks of Hewlett-Packard and facing sexism along the way. She also recounted being asked on national television whether a woman in the Oval Office might be affected by her hormones. \n\n"So ladies, let's just think. Can we think of a single instance in which a man's judgment was clouded by his hormones?" she quipped, to roaring applause. \n\nShe continued: "I am not asking for your vote and your support because I am a woman. I am asking for your vote and your support because I am the most qualified candidate to win this job and to do this job."

The journey is a benefit run that, once completed, could change the lives of up to 250 underprivileged youth \n     Caleb Galaraga     \nPublished 3:54 PM, September 04, 2015 \n \nUpdated 3:55 PM, Sep 04, 2015 \n      \n\n\nChristian minister Ferdie Capiling plans to run from Saranggani to Aparri. Photo courtesy of the author. \n \nMANILA, Philippines - Two thousand. Two hundred. Twenty. Forty-four. \n \nOn Saturday, September 5 at 3 AM in Maasim, Sarangani, a town in Mindanao lying at the southernmost tip of the country, these numbers will be top-of-mind to one man’s race, a run across the Philippines. \n \nPastor and ultra marathon runner Ferdie Cabiling embarks on what he describes as an “epic and raw adventure.” He will run 50 kilometers a day for 44 days, and while in the trek will celebrate his 50th birthday. \n \nThe title of his journey: RUN50. It starts at Sarangani and will end at Aparri, a total of 2,180 kilometers. Crossing the finish line is a must, but more importantly, the journey is a benefit run that, once completed, could change the lives of up to 250 underprivileged youth. \n \nInspired by a running priest \n \n“The idea of running around the corner in a new place is already a treat. But running around the country? It’s even more exhilarating,” the pastor shares in a blog post, Seven Reasons why #RunAcrossThePH. \n \nThe spark to do RUN50 came after reading the blog of another minister, a running priest named Father Amado “Picx” Picardal. \n \nAfter all, the pastor has the chops to do a long-haul run. He has completed 10 marathons that were organized by General Jovie Narcise. He’s also very passionate and vocal about the sport. Leaders and members of his home church, Victory Manila, already call him the running pastor. The soon-to-be 50-year-old minister is currently one of the church’s executive directors, where he oversees its 15 congregations in Metro Manila, attended by up to 75,000 people every week. \n \n“It’s a dream project that would benefit many. I’ve already trained and equipped him for it and he has the mental toughness to finish the race,” says his trainer, Tito Salazar. \n \nCabiling has been working with him for 3 years and has relied on him for encouragement, support and professional guidance. Thanks to Salazar’s coaching, the passionate runner has completed some daunting and challenging runs like the Bataan Death March 160K Run. \n \n“His legs are worth millions,” Salazar says, expressing full confidence that his client can complete his races. “Fifty kilometers a day for him is like a walk in the park,” the trainer adds. \n \n'I run for those who can’t' \n \nVictory is known in evangelical circles as a young and dynamic ministry. It has grown by leaps and bounds since its founding, thanks to a relentless focus on reaching students. Their mission is imbued in a catchphrase its active young members repeat like a mantra: “Change the campus. Change the world.” \n \nCabiling was one of the first members of the church, since the latter’s accidental founding in the mid-1980s by American missionary Steve Murrell. \n \n“I can’t clearly put a demarcation line on when,” he responds, asked when he became a full-time pastor. In 1984, while studying Civil Engineering at Adamson University, he first heard the gospel from a group of missionaries and committed to be part of what was then a daily worship service. It was during those times when he met Murrell, who would be his mentor in the faith. As a young evangelical, he discovered that he was more passionate in bridging people to God than building real bridges. \n \nOver the next 30 years, he will be mentoring young people who would turn out to be some of Victory’s major influencers. Case in point: Two men he shared the gospel to, both of whom were still teenagers when he was their Bible study leader, are now senior pastors of 2 large Victory congregations. \n \nDeveloping leadership skills and imparting the desire to live a life of integrity and excellence, while prioritizing the growth of one’s faith, is at the heart of Victory’s outreach. In 2007, members of the church leadership created the Real LIFE Foundation, with “the vision of seeing thousands of marginalized Filipino youth educated, gainfully employed and uplifting their communities.” \n \nRUN50 will raise a little over P2 million pesos for the organization, enough to support 250 scholars. \n \n“I will be raising P1,000.00 per kilometer. And since there are 2,180 kilometers from Maasim to Aparri, we will be raising almost P2 million pesos,” the running pastor shares. \n \nCabiling’s wife, Judy, initially teased her avid runner of a husband that his love for the sport is caused by a mid-life crisis, “She actually increased my insurance.” \n \n\n\n(R-L) Ferdie Cabiling, his wife Judy, daughter Elle and son John Phillip. Photo courtesy of the author \n \nBut similar to how Judy faithfully supported her husband’s calling, she has been all in to his every personal race. Their daughter Elle, who recently graduated from the University of the Philippines and is preparing to become a full-time minister herself, is heavily involved in the logistics of RUN50. Their 11-year-old son, John Phillip is a major inspiration for this race. “He can walk and tries to run sometimes to show off to daddy, but he does it by literally dragging his right leg which was affected by the inborn condition in the brain.” \n \nThe marathoner dedicates this coming race to John Phillip and others who are experiencing disabilities. “I run for those who can’t,” is a tagline the pastor uses on all his runs. \n \nFor God and the next generation \n \nCabiling is flying to Mindanao 48 hours before his race so he can pray for a church member in General Santos suffering from cancer. He won’t be running on Sundays, as he’ll be preaching in churches – as he had been doing for the past three decades. Praying for government leaders of cities and municipalities along the path of RUN50 is also in the plan.  \n \n“As a believer, I run for God’s glory and pleasure,” Cabiling writes in a blog post. He then refers to a quote by the famous Scottish athlete and missionary, Eric Liddell: “I believe God made me for a purpose and He also made me fast. When I run, I feel His pleasure.” \n \nCabiling has dedicated his life to inspiring the next generation to live a life for God. The chance to positively influence the lives of 250 Filipino students may be the greatest prize of the solo journey of a man filled with faith. \n \nIt wouldn’t be daring to suggest that it would be to God’s pleasure that he completes it. - Rappler.com \n \nTo know more on how you can support RU50, visit Pastor Ferdie Cabiling’s website here . \n \nCaleb Galaraga is a freelance writer based in Metro Manila.

0109_84446ca0-85e5-465d-9e48-15b360085cb9	Another American League (AL) triumph over the National League (NL) in 2015 inter-league contests is a near-certainty. The AL is the superior league by far and has been for more than a decade.\nSo far in 2015 through 7 September and including their All-star match triumph, AL teams are 151-124 or 54% wins against NL teams or right in line with the AL's record of dominance over the past dozen years.\nThis is the AL's 12th consecutive triumph in annual inter-league contests starting with 2004. The only positive sign for the NL is that the AL's 53% average (including All-Star and World Series matches) from 2010 on is below the 55.9% average from 2004 through 2009 and below the annual average winning record of 54.5% for the entire 2004-2015 period of AL dominance.\nThe AL has now won 16 of the last 19 all-star games to reach a decision and 21 of the last 27. \nToronto Blue Jays\nI have to declare a conflict of interest when Toronto faces a NL squad -- 10-7 so far. I and official Godiva toy boy and fiancé Archibald have a friendly wager. If the AL's winning % against the NL for the entire 2015 season betters the Blue Jays' record, dearest Archibald has to treat me like the Queen of Sheba for a day. Conversely, if the Blue Jays better the AL's mastery over the NL, I have to dress up and act like the Queen of Sheba paying court to King Solomon for a day. \nSo far, Arch and his beloved Blue Jays are 78-59. My prognostication of continued Lady G mastery over Archibald based on AL domination over the NL exceeding the Blue Jays' win percentage is in doubt with 2/13 of the season left. \nBlue Jays leading both leagues averaging 5.5 runs/match and now 12th best allowing 4.1 runs/match. If they keep up such a large run differential of +1.4/game, they will finish 1st in the AL East and make the playoffs for the 1st time since 1993. The only reason that they are only a 57% team so far is their 13-24 record in one-run games, which is almost entirely due to bad luck. \nBut, with minor-leaguers Pillar, Colabello, Thole and Goins in the line-up regularly, it's hard to believe that they can keep scoring 5 runs/match over the remainder of the season. So far, Colabello is hitting like an all-star rather than the career journeyman that he has been up to now and Pillar and Goins have both been impersonating major-leaguer hitters with Goins leading the AL in on-base % since 1 August. This is amazing for a player who was one of the worst hitters in baseball last year. Both Goins and Pillar are exceeding their minor-league numbers so far this year. I keep waiting for the true minor-league talent levels to emerge as the season wears on, but so far so good for the Jays.  \nThe Jays had uncanny good luck hitting with runners in scoring position over the first 11/13 of matches. My premise is that what looks like clutch hitting is just dumb luck. I expect to see the Jays' runs/match fall back to the pack over the rest of the year. \nJays 8-42 in matches when they score 3 runs or less and 70-17 when they have score more than 3. All teams have a split like that, but my guess is that the split is particularly extreme for the Jays and that over 1/3 of matches with 3 runs or fewer is unusually high for a team averaging 5.5 runs/match.\nI predict that the trade of declining, overpaid Reyes for declining 30-year-old Tulowitzki overpaid through 2020 will not help the Jays much this year and will hurt in future. That being predicted, I have to note that the Jays are 28-8 since Tulowitzki arrived. Tulowitzki is certainly better than Reyes, but not by that much. The 28-8 streak is good luck not related to Tulowitzki over a period when their starting pitchers were setting a team record of 20 straight matches allowing 3 or less earned runs. LaTroy Hawkins should also help in the bullpen. However, the three pitching prospects sent to Colorado will likely be worth more than Tulowitzki in future years. When the trade went down, I predicted that last-place Colorado would make play-offs before the Jays. I continue to believe that both Mets and Miami got the better of their trades with the Blue Jays after the 2012 season and that both have better prospects of making the playoffs before the Jays as a result. The sooner Jay General misManager Anthopoulos is gone, the better. Even after the Jays make the playoffs this year, I fear that they are more likely to lose 100 games than make the playoffs again over the next few years. However, I do recognize that the Jays and Anthopoulos are on the threshold of proving me wrong for this year. \nHiring Cleveland General Manager Mark Shapiro as new Blue Jay President is a good sign. Unlike Anthopoulos, Shapiro is a "value-for-money" operator.\nI view Anthopoulos as similar to a mutual fund manager who follows an active stock-picking strategy. An active stock-picker can lead the mutual fund annual tables due to good luck in any given year, but over the long haul a "value indexer" like Billy Beane in Oakland will continue to have a better record than whoever is running the Jays until Toronto brings in a quantitative analyst to run the team. Here's hoping that Shapiro gets a chance to hire his own people.  \nIf the Jays go 8-4 in matches started by David Price vs. 6-6 if they had put Aaron Sanchez back in the rotation, that could make the difference between finishing in or out of the playoffs. So far, Jays are 5-2 in matches started by Price and one of the losses was misManager Gibbons' fault. \nJays probably need to win just 9 or 36% of their remaining 25 games to make the playoffs. If they maintain their positive run differential, that should remain 1st in the AL East ahead of the Yankees easily as ESPN talk radio host Mike Greenberg and ESPN commentator Rick Sutcliffe predicted right after the Tulowitzki and Price trades. Jays are now on track to win 90 which should be good enough for 1st.\nSo far this year, Jays started 23-30, then went on a 14-2 streak followed by 13-19, then 28-7 or the best 35-game stretch in team history with 80% wins projecting to 130-32 over a full season. Let's see how well they do in the final stretch of the season with most matches on the road. So far, they are 0-1. I remain skeptical that they can close it out well enough to win a playoff round. Their ageing stars -- Bautista, Encarnacion, Martin, Tulowitzki, Dickey, Buerhle -- are vulnerable to fatigue and injuries as the season wears on. But, of course, so are the Yankees with Teixera, AFraud, Sabbathia and Beltran (and now it looks as if Texeira may be through for the year). \nBill James wrote a famous article showing that Detroit's 35-5 start in 1984 could not likely be a run of good luck by a mediocre team. Over 40 games, the chances of a mediocre team posting a 35-5 record are tiny. The same must be true for the Jays 28-7 streak this year. The 2015 Jays are right up there with the 1984 Tigers and the LA Dodgers 42-8 streak of a few years ago for the best hot streaks in MLB history. But, I am still skeptical. If I get time before the start of the 2016 season, I would like to look at 2015 "batting average balls in play" (BABIP) numbers for Goins, Pillar and other Jay hitters and the pitchers as well. Is it possible for an entire team to have an unusually lucky BABIP year on both sides of the ball?\nArchibald is so confident that this is the year for the Blue Jays that he has promised to end our long engagement and marry me outside the Skydome the day after the Blue Jays win the World Series. On 2nd thought, perhaps Archibald is not confident in his Blue Jays winning. I'm starting to think that he likes being engaged more than he wants to be married.
0110_3177add6-be44-4a0c-8d58-7d0ccb9c0320	Author: Chung-In Moon, Yonsei University \n \nOn the brink of a crisis that threatened to escalate into conflict, North and South Korea recently reached an agreement on 25 August to prevent further confrontation, resume official talks, hold reunions of separated families and promote civilian exchanges. This was a remarkable reversal in tensions. But the thaw is only the beginning of a precarious and long journey toward peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. As long as Pyongyang keeps its nuclear weapons program, it is virtually inconceivable that confidence-building and peaceful co-existence between the two Koreas can be achieved. \n \n\n \nSince March 2009, the North Korean nuclear issue has been stalled and the Six-Party Talks suspended. While North Korea has declared ‘no more talks with the US’, Washington is equally reluctant to engage with Pyongyang unless the hermit regime takes some concrete steps toward denuclearisation. Stuck between the two, China, South Korea and other the other Six-Party Talks members have become lethargic. Are there any ways out? \n \nThe recent Iranian nuclear deal could serve as a useful benchmark. As President Barack Obama claims, it was a victory of diplomacy over war. Several factors account for its success. Setting realistic goals was one of those factors. Against the conservative’s all-or-nothing approach of insisting on ‘no deal without a complete removal of nuclear programs’, the US admitted Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, while banning its enrichment programs under a tight inspection regime. \n \nEqually crucial was setting the right priorities. Iran has been notorious for its sponsorship of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, interference in the domestic politics of neighbouring countries, undermining regional stability and human rights violations. But the nuclear issue was prioritised, with the anticipation that other issues would become easier to solve once the nuclear one was settled. The US also aptly limited sanctions, which was useful in bringing Iran to the negotiation table and making the current deal. Additional sanctions would have created a serious political backlash, which could have penalised moderates such as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while empowering such hardliners as radical Islamic forces and the military. \n \nIran and North Korea are, of course, very different. Iran does not have nuclear weapons, while North Korea does. The permanent members of UN Security Council have all reached a consensus on the Iranian deal, but members of the Six-Party Talks have been divided over how to deal with the DPRK. Iran has taken a practical path to denuclearisation for economic gains, whereas North Korea is seeking the perilous nuclear path despite enormous economic costs incurred by sanctions. No matter how limited it may be, Iran has a pluralistic political system with regular competitive elections. North Korea, on the other hand, is an extremely monolithic political system without any free elections. \n \nFor all the differences, the Iranian model can still be applied to North Korea. Sanctions, pressure and military action are not viable alternatives . The US should forsake its ‘strategic patience’ policy and engage. Demonising North Korea will lead the US nowhere. As with Iran, the US should set more practical goals. Complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear weapons will take a long time. As Siegfried Hecker — a renowned US nuclear expert — has suggested, it would be wiser to seek a ‘halt and roll back’ option. Freezing current nuclear programs and rolling back to the level specified by the agreement reached on 13 February 2007 — whereby North Korea agreed to shut down and seal its major nuclear research facility, Yongbyon, and invite international monitoring — might be the most practical solution. \n \nNo matter how powerful the US is, it cannot achieve complete denuclearisation, opening and reform, human rights improvements and cyber security in North Korea simultaneously. There must be a reordering of priorities where utmost attention is given to the nuclear issue. The Iranian nuclear deal would have never materialised without personal commitments by top US Department of State officials like John Kerry, William Burns, Wendy Sherman and President Obama himself. In a similar vein, high powered figures need to be appointed solely to deal with Pyongyang. \n \nIt is not easy for Obama to change his position on North Korea, particularly given his political schedule. Outside pressure seems necessary. Such pressure can come from South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who will be visiting Washington in October 2015. Using recent improved inter-Korean relations as leverage, Park can persuade Obama to engage with the North and to resume the Six-Party Talks. Such an approach is the only realistic one that can bring North Korea back to the negotiating table and foster the process of its denuclearisation . \n \nIt is ironic to note that learning from its failures in dealing with North Korea was vital to the United States’ success in dealing with Iran. Now it is time for the Obama administration to apply what it has learned from Iran to North Korea. \n \nChung-in Moon is a professor at the Department of Political Science, Yonsei University.

When we came out and got in the car we could see impressive lightning strikes to the west, accompanied by dark funnel clouds descending over the White Tank Mountains. When we got out on the road we could see that same strong storm activity to the north and to the east of us. And yet, we didn't have a single drop of rain touch our windshield. This year's monsoon season has been as strange as Bruce Jenner's wardrobe. A few weeks ago, just to the west of us, the little town of Wickenburg had a "hundred year flood"...and we didn't get a drop of rain over our way. Last week was the same. As we were bone dry in Sun City and Surprise, folks over in Scottsdale were drowning, their cars doing the dog paddle down the East 101 freeway. On Friday I drove over to Safeway. The wind was blowing forcefully, shingles on roofs were flying about like frisbees, but we didn't get enough rain to fill a shot glass! So, as we drove home, I looked about, west, north, south and east, and torrential rains and gale force winds were having a party up in Cave Creek, over in Scottsdale, in Tempe....and we were driving along a highway in calm seas just a few miles from those storms! The next morning I opened up my morning paper and looked at pics of trees fallen in long impressive rows over on the East side. The electric company says 14,000 people are without power due to the storm bringing down power lines. And we are still sitting here high and dry! Amazing! Arizona's monsoon has now eclipsed the awe that we once felt about the weather when we lived in Hawaii. In Hawaii you could stand on one side of the street, the sun shining and not a drop of rain, and the other side of the street would be drenched in a downpour, an impressive stream of water flowing down the street gutters. But an Arizona storm is absolutely freaky....it'll level a house with a microburst, fill a whole neighborhood with a foot of water, and the other side of town will be sunny and dry and leaving one to say "what storm?" Monsoon season in Arizona ends every year around the 15th of September. We won't miss it. "Monsoon, we hardly knew ye".
0112_9f6e8fb0-ba39-406c-bedf-51a748c73308	A core member of Sinn Fein's leadership and alleged former head of IRA intelligence has been arrested by police investigating a murder linked to Provos. \n \n\t\t \nBobby Storey is northern chairman of the party and was one of three well-known republicans detained today in connection with the fatal shooting of Kevin McGuigan in Belfast last month which has brought the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland to the brink of collapse. \n  Kevin McGuigan's murder has provoked a political crisis at Stormont   \nSinn Fein Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said Mr Storey was a key advocate of peace. \n\n\t\t\t \n"I was surprised to learn about the arrest this morning of our six-county party chair Bobby Storey. \n\n\n\n \n"Bobby Storey is a valued member of Sinn Fein's core leadership. He has played a leading role in the development of Sinn Fein's peace strategy and is a longstanding and loyal supporter, defender and advocate of the peace and political processes. \n\n"We look forward with confidence to his early release." \n\nPolice have said the murder of Mr McGuigan was not sanctioned by the IRA. \n\nBut they said one of the major lines of inquiry is that members of the Provisional IRA were involved in the murder. \n\n\t\t\t \nIt has been alleged to have been carried out in retaliation for the murder of another former IRA prisoner, Gerard "Jock" Davison, at his home in the Markets area of Belfast in May. \n\nMr Storey was one of three men, aged 45, 58 and 59, who were arrested in Belfast this morning as part of the police investigation. \n\nIn 2005 former Ulster Unionist South Antrim MP David Burnside told the Commons: "The Secretary of State knows the facts from his security information. He knows about Bobby Storey, head of intelligence, reporting to the army council." \n\nSinn Fein president Gerry Adams also reacted to the arrest, describing Mr Storey as a valued member of the party leadership, a person of great integrity and someone he trusts. \n\n\t\t\t \n"He's been charged with nothing. I have grave concerns about how all of this current crisis has developed since the dreadful killing of Kevin McGuigan, and am mindful in recent times that two families, the Davison and McGuigan families, have both been grieved," Mr Adams said. \n\nThe Sinn Fein leader claimed the potential for a breakdown of the talks at Stormont House was more to do with ongoing competition for support between the Ulster Unionists and Democratic Unionists. \n\nMr Adams added: "At this stage I don't want to go any further than saying I have grave concerns about how all this has developed, including the arrest of Bobby Storey." \n\nSinn Fein said it was their understanding that DUP leader Peter Robinson had given Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers "an ultimatum" to suspend the Stormont institutions or the party's ministers would be withdrawn following the Storey arrest. \n\nSubsequently the DUP sought an adjournment of Assembly business. \n\n\t\t\t \nThe McGuigan arrests, made in north and west Belfast, take to 16 the number of people detained as part of the murder investigation to date. \n\nOne man has been charged with weapons offences. \n\nMr McGuigan, a 53-year-old father-of-nine, was gunned down outside his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand area of east Belfast last month. \n\nHe was suspected by some in the republican movement of involvement in the Davison murder. \n\nAlthough detectives said individual IRA members were involved in the shooting, they have said there is no evidence to suggest it was sanctioned at a senior level. \n\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable George Hamilton has also said the IRA is not engaged in terrorism but instead is pursuing a peaceful, political republican agenda. \n\nThe political fallout from both murders has had major repercussions for the devolved Assembly, with crisis talks ongoing at Stormont in a bid to save the stumbling institutions. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

0114_517ba3c1-54ea-4dbf-8b11-de3f8b5727a2	Video  Goodes retires after Sydney's loss \n \nRetiring Sydney star Adam Goodes has been rated the greatest Swan of all by the man whose club appearance record he broke. \n\nGoodes 35, made a low-key exit from the game he has graced since 1999, announcing his retirement to teammates in the sheds after Saturday's semi-final home loss to North Melbourne. \n\nHe eschewed the fanfare of an emotional public farewell out on the field and the chance to be chaired off the ground, like retiring teammate Rhyce Shaw. \n\nAt the end of an epic career and tumultuous season, Goodes leaves the game having chalked up 372 appearances, the eighth highest tally of all time and the most by an indigenous player. \n\nHe won two premiership and Brownlow Medals, a Rising Star award, made the All-Australian team four times, captained Sydney and the Australian side in the international rules series and was named in the indigenous team of the century. \n\n"I think he goes down as probably our greatest Swan," said former Swans forward Michael O'Loughlin, whose record of 303 games Goodes surpassed in 2012. \n\n"Thats no disrespect to anyone who has played for us before, but I think the influence and the winning percentage games that he has been able to play, for the longevity. \n \nVideo  Cunnington stars as North beat Swans \n \n"Your superstars play for a long time and he's absolutely one of those without a question. \n\n"It was a pretty emotional night." \n\nSydney coach John Longmire echoed O'Loughlin's lofty valuation of Goodes. \n\n"We've had a few great players over the last few years retire, none as great as Goodesy, no disrespect to the others," Longmire said. \n\n"He's been an absolute icon to this footy club, 18 years, a couple of Brownlows, four All-Australians, he's been a superstar of the game," \n\nAfter taking a week off following booing from opposing fans at several away matches, Goodes finished his final season in strong fashion. \n\nHe was among Sydney's best players in the back-to-back finals losses which denied him the opportunity to become the first Swan to win three premierships. \n\n"The old man finished his season off pretty well over the last month and a half, two months," O'Loughlin joked. \n\nLongmire said it would be hard to imagine life at Sydney without Goodes and was full of praise for the way he had conducted himself though a turbulent campaign. \n\n"He's been absolutely superb in the face of some really tough times for him," Longmire said. \n\n"He'll take a deep breath now, it's been a tough night and a tough season for him." \n\nO'Loughlin attributed the success of his close friend and former teammate Goodes to his strong work ethic. \n\n"I watched him walk in as a 17-year-old and he walks away now as the games record holder and one of our greatest ever players, not only in our club, but in the history of the game, so really proud of the person he's become," O'Loughlin said. \n\n"But also obviously the football player that he's been able to turn himself into through pure hard work," \n\nShaw described Goodes's decision to retire as " bit of a shock" and would have liked his colleague to have left the ground in similar fashion to himself. \n\n"It would have been fantastic for Goodesy to be up there with me, but he wanted to do it his own way," Shaw said.
0115_88b2e5e5-1b4b-4aa1-998c-940e70fef93e	 \nIt’s fitting that Roger Goodell’s biggest failure, the one that could well end up permanently lessening the considerable power he and NFL owners have traditionally held over the NFLPA, was born out of the stupidest scandal in the history of the NFL, and perhaps all of sports. This is precisely the kind of defeat that someone as impotent and hollow-headed as Goodell deserves. \n\nHe suspended Ray Rice just two games after Rice knocked his fianceé out in an elevator, then suspended Rice indefinitely after video tape of the incident turned the original, paltry suspension into a PR nightmare for the league. A judge later overturned that second suspension because Rice was essentially being punished twice for the same crime, and because the NFL had no real evidence that Rice had lied during the league’s investigation into the incident. \n\nHe hit the New Orleans Saints with sweeping and severe penalties after determining that the team had instituted a bounty program. Those suspensions were later overturned by ex-commissioner Paul Tagliabue on the grounds that Goodell had overstepped his bounds and reached his decision based on faulty evidence. \n\nHe eagerly exploited the Adrian Peterson child abuse case as a way to restore his authority and brand as a stern, tough-minded disciplinarian. That suspension was later overturned by a federal judge because Goodell had retroactively and unfairly applied the league’s new domestic violence policy to Peterson’s case. \n\nAnd now this. This particular defeat feels more meaningful than the previous ones, though, in part because of how truly benign the original “crime” was. Those other suspensions being vacated were big victories for the NFLPA, but Goodell’s flanks were still protected by the fact that he was facing off with a child abuser, a wife-beater, and a football team that purposely tried to hurt people. No matter how slapdash and wrongheaded Goodell’s ersatz judicial processes were revealed to be, he was always able to position himself as a good guy, just trying to get tough on bad people and do the right thing. He was able to point to his failures as evidence that all he needed to Get Things Right in the future was more power. \n\nhttp://deadspin.com/roger-goodell \n\n-... \n\nIt’s much harder to imagine Goodell spinning this loss in his favor, though. There’s no monstrous crime with which to obscure his own failures this time. All Goodell has to protect himself with in this instance is that a few footballs that may or may not have been deflated by an amount that may or may not have made any real difference. This is to say that when Judge Richard Berman goes in on Goodell’s kangaroo court, essentially calling the whole operation flatly illegal, people are going to notice. \n\nNow, any player who is suspended by Goodell under the same suspect jurisdiction of…
0116_71b4bcef-16d0-45ac-809f-9aa82c579699	The latest on the decision not to list the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered (all times local): \n\n9:35 a.m. \n\nA senior congressional Democrat says Republican criticism of the decision not to give federal protections to the greater sage grouse lacks credibility. \n\nU.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva (gree-HAHL'-vuh) of Arizona says House Republicans attack President Barack Obama when his administration lists a species as endangered and attack him when it decides against a listing, comparing the rhetoric to a game of "Mad Libs." \n\nThe Interior Department said Tuesday that the bird doesn't need to be listed as threatened or endangered across its 11-state Western range. \n\nGrijalva is the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Natural Resources. The panel's chairman, Republican Rob Bishop of Utah, says the announcement is intended to mask the fact that the Obama administration has imposed limits on development across the West. \n\n--- \n\n9:07 a.m. \n\nWildlife advocates have mixed reactions to the rejection of federal protections for greater sage grouse. \n\nGroups including the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society said Tuesday's announcement shows cooperation between government and private interest groups can preserve imperiled species. \n\nBut critics say loopholes in dozens of government land-use plans intended to preserve the bird's shrinking habitat would allow too much development. \n\nErik Molvar with WildEarth Guardians says federal officials were missing a chance to save the bird. He called it an "epic conservation failure." \n\nMolvar's group challenged the government's failure to act on sage grouse in 2010 as its population declined. That resulted in a settlement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that forced Tuesday's decision on the bird's legal status. \n\n--- \n\n8:20 a.m. \n\nThe head of the House Committee on Natural Resources calls the decision not to seek federal protections for the greater sage grouse a cynical ploy. \n\nThe U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday that the bird does not need to be listed as threatened or endangered across its 11-state Western range. But Republican Rob Bishop of Utah says the announcement is intended to mask the fact that the Obama administration has imposed limits on development across the West. \n\nHe's referring to changes in government policies guiding lands controlled by the U.S. Forest Service and Interior's Bureau of Land Management. \n\nThe Independent Petroleum Association, meanwhile, says the land use plans will hurt the country's smaller oil and natural gas producers, which operate about 95 percent of its wells. \n\n--- \n\n7:30 a.m. \n\nAn aide to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell says recent policy changes provide protections for the greater sage grouse on 67 million acres of federal lands. That includes 12 million acres where strict limits on oil and gas drilling will be enforced. \n\nSarah Greenberger made the comments after the U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday that the bird does not need to be listed as threatened or endangered across its 11-state Western range. \n\nGreenberger says efforts made by the federal and state governments in recent years produced the largest land conservation effort in U.S. history. \n\nThe Obama administration says it has struck a balance to save the imperiled ground-dwelling birds from extinction without crippling the West's economy. \n\n--- \n\n7 a.m. \n\nThe U.S. Interior Department says the greater sage grouse does not need federal protections across its 11-state Western range after some limits were put on energy development and other activities. \n\nTuesday's announcement signals that the Obama administration believes it has struck a balance to save the widespread, ground-dwelling birds from extinction without crippling the West's economy. \n\nIt follows a costly conservation effort, and could help defuse a potential political liability for Democrats heading into the 2016 election. \n\nFederal protections could have brought much more sweeping restrictions on oil and gas drilling, grazing and other human activities from California to the Dakotas. \n\nRepublicans have seized on the issue as supposed evidence of wildlife protection laws run amok. \n\nEnvironmentalists who sued to force Tuesday's decision are certain to challenge it.

Born in Slovenia, Aljaz took to the dance floor at the age of five, enjoying success in his home country where he won 19 Slovenian championships in ballroom and Latin. For over a decade, Aljaž has represented Slovenia in the World Latin and Ballroom Championships, and has also appeared in Slovenia’s Dancing with the Stars. In 2010, Aljaž joined the cast of Burn the Floor where he has since performed around the world as one of its leading males. \n \nAnton Du Beke \n \nStrictly favourite Anton specialises in Ballroom dancing and has been performing since the age of 14. As a seasoned pro, Anton has appeared in every series of Strictly to date, but he is still yet to lift the Glitter Ball Trophy. Anton was memorably matched with former MP Ann Widdecombe, making it to the quarter-finals together in 2010. \n \nBrendan Cole \n \nKiwi Brendan specialises in all things Latin-American and began dancing at the age of six, going on to become the New Zealand and Asian Open Professional Champion. Brendan was the first dancer to lift the Glitter Ball Trophy in series one with Newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky, and has also been a judge on the New Zealand version of Strictly Come Dancing. He and Anton are the longest serving professional dancers on the show. \n \nGiovanni Pernice \n \nGiovanni was born in Sicily and decided from a young age that he wanted to take up dance lessons. At 14 years old he moved to Bologna to concentrate on dance and to be taught by some of the best teachers in the world. His greatest achievement is the day he won the Italian Championships in 2012. He has the date tattooed on his wrist, along with ‘Nato per vincere’ meaning ‘Born to Win’ written on his arm. His favourite dance style is Jive as he feels it reflects his cheeky character. He is very much looking forward to moving to the UK and joining the show which has been a dream of his for many years. \n \nGleb Savchenko \n \nRussian born Gleb has been dancing since he was eight years old when he started lessons in his home town of Moscow. He has travelled the world competing and performing, and earlier this year he returned to his home country to partner Adelina Sotnikova, an Olympic Gold ice skater in the Russian version of Strictly Come Dancing. Gleb also competed in Dancing with the Stars in the USA where he was paired with Lisa Vanderpump. Some of Gleb’s greatest achievements include coming 10th in the World and 1st in Rising Stars. Gleb has also modelled for numerous brands including dancing with Jennifer Lopez. Gleb specialises in Latin and is passionate about joining Strictly. \n \n  \n \nKevin Clifton \n \n‘Kevin from Grimsby’ returns to Strictly Come Dancing for a third year, following his success with reaching two consecutive grand finals, the first with presenter Susanna Reid in 2013 and the second with Frankie Bridge in 2014. Kevin is a former Youth World Number One and four-time British Latin Champion, who has won International Open titles across the globe. He trained in ballroom and Latin from an early age, taught by his parents, former World Champions Keith and Judy Clifton. Kevin made his musical theatre debut in 2010, starring in Dirty Dancing in the West End, and he has been a principal dancer of the Burn the Floor Dance Company for several years. Kevin is married to fellow Strictly professional Karen Clifton. \n \nPasha Kovalev \n \nSiberian-born Pasha is the Strictly Come Dancing reigning champion having won the show in 2014 with his partner Caroline Flack. Back for his fifth series, he was also a runner up in the competition with Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh in 2012. Since his early dancing days Pasha has gone from strength to strength; he was a finalist on the US version of So You Think You Can Dance, performed on Broadway, and starred in the West End’s Burn the Floor.

0118_b360dc4c-140d-4dd2-9af9-5a927017ffb1	Jeremy Corbyn is drawing up a new-look Labour frontbench team after his seismic victory in the party's leadership race sparked a flurry of senior resignations. \n \n\t\t \nThe veteran left-winger won a landslide victory with  almost 60% of the vote - trouncing mainstream rivals Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall. \n   \nHe topped the ballot not just among new supporters paying £3 to join and trade unionists but also full party members,  making it extremely difficult for any disgruntled moderates to mount a bid to unseat him before the 2020 general election. \n\n\t\t\t \nIn an acceptance speech to cheering supporters at Westminster, he called repeatedly for "unity" and announced his ambition to lead a Labour "fightback". \n\n\n\n \nBut the scale of his task in bringing the party together around a radical programme was underlined by the immediate departure of several frontbenchers. \n\nMs Cooper was joined by Rachel Reeves, Emma Reynolds and Jamie Reed in announcing they would not serve on the frontbench while  Ms Kendall, Tristram Hunt and  Chris Leslie had already indicated their political differences with Mr Corbyn. \n   \nEd Miliband - whose resignation after leading the party to general election disaster in May provoked the contest - called on the party to join him in supporting Mr Corbyn but indicated that he too would not seek a return to the frontline. \n\nHowever, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna - a senior centrist who withdrew from the contest after a matter of days - issued a plea for the party to "come together" behind its new leader " and focus on providing the most credible and effective opposition to the Tories". \n\n\t\t\t \nCorbyn supporters chanted "Jez we did" and sang the socialist anthem The Red Flag as they celebrated his comprehensive victory, taking  59.5% of the vote - 251,417 of the 422,664 votes cast - against 19% for Mr Burnham, 17% for Ms Cooper and 4.5% for Ms Kendall. \n\nThe new leader has spent his entire 32-year parliamentary career on the backbenches and entered the leadership contest as a 200-1 outsider before generating a wave of enthusiasm which swept him to victory. \n   \nHe sought to galvanise that support first in a victory party with activists at a Westminster pub and then by addressing - as his first official engagement as Opposition leader - a huge crowd attending a pro-refugee rally in Parliament Square. \n\nNow, he is familiarising himself with the party's nearby HQ as he starts to piece together  a shadow cabinet able to deliver his anti-austerity, anti-war policies without splitting the party. \n\n\t\t\t \nUnion leaders welcomed his victory but Conservative Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said a Corbyn-led Labour posed "a serious risk to our nation's security, our economy's security and your family's security". \n\nWest Bromwich East MP Tom Watson was elected deputy leader and is expected to play an important role in helping to build Mr Corbyn's frontbench team and maintain party unity and discipline. \n\nMr Corbyn admitted he was "a bit surprised" at the scale of his majority, which he said amounted to a "fantastic mandate for change in British politics, with a fantastic enthusiasm for real democratic politics". \n\nAsked whether he now faces a challenge to construct a shadow cabinet without several senior figures who have said they will not join, the new Labour leader said: "There's going to be an inclusive, open process. \n\n"I hope everyone will recognise the mandate we've received and that party members expect our party to deliver for them in Parliament." \n\n\t\t\t \n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

0125_b76772fd-9df7-41de-a555-3bbf6c483421	US Open champion Novak Djokovic is honoured to be considered among the greats of the game and has warned his rivals he has many years left in him yet. \n \nDjokovic ousted world number two Roger Federer 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-4 to win his second title at Flushing Meadows and 10th major overall, moving the Serb to within one of Bjorn Borg on the Open era’s all-time list. \n \nAbove Borg sit both Rafael Nadal and Pete Sampras on 14 grand slam triumphs while Djokovic still remains seven short of Federer’s all-time best 17. \n \nThe 28-year-old, however, claimed three of the four grand slams in 2015 and has now reached 16 of the last 21 major finals. \n \nThe record is testament to Djokovic’s consistency at the top of the men’s game which, at his current rate, means there is a strong chance the Serb could match or even surpass Federer’s total. \n \n“We’ve got to double digits now,” Djokovic said. \n \n“And I’m so obviously flattered and honoured to be a part of an elite group of players, legends of our sports to manage to win this many grand slam trophies in their lives and careers. \n \n“So to be just mentioned alongside them is truly something special.” \n \nDjokovic is one of the greatest athletes the game has ever seen, taking meticulous care of his diet and physique, and it would be no surprise if his career extended well into his thirties. \n \n“I’m 28. I have always valued the care for my body and my mind and had this holistic approach to life,” Djokovic said. \n \n“I will continue on with the same kind of lifestyle, same kind of approach. I think that kind of approach brought me to where I am today. \n \n“Hopefully this kind of approach will give me longevity and that I can have many more years to come and, as I said, many more opportunities to fight for these trophies. \n \n“As long as there is this flare in me I will be coming back.” \n \nDjokovic’s only grand slam defeat this year came in the French Open final to Stan Wawrinka, meaning he went one better than his famous 2011 season, when he also won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open but lost in the semi-finals at Roland Garros. \n \nThe Serb has been the stand-out player in the world again this year and believes his performances have been even better than four years ago. \n \n“I think it’s definitely more difficult to repeat something like that than actually doing it for the first time,” Djokovic said. \n \n“I’m a different player, a different person today than I was in 2011. \n \n“As a father and a husband, it’s a completely different approach to tennis today. \n \n“I feel more fulfilled. I feel more complete as a player today than I was in 2011 – physically stronger, mentally more experienced, and tougher as well. \n \n“I think being in the situation before helped me to understand particular obstacles that are on the way and how I need to overcome them, which I did last night.” \n \nDjokovic was a worthy winner against Federer, who came into the final having not dropped a set since Wimbledon in July, but the 34-year-old could not overcome his opponent’s relentless hitting and masterful defence. \n \nThe Swiss missed 19 break-point opportunities as Djokovic was more clinical in the important moments, showing his iron-will again to secure a hard-fought victory. \n \n“To win against one of the biggest rivals, an all-time grand slam champion, somebody that always keeps fighting till the last point, keeps making you play an extra shot – all these things now are very special to me,” Djokovic said. \n \n“This is a night that I will definitely remember for a very long time.” \n \nThe post appeared first on Press and Journal .

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and his girlfriend of nine years, Lauren Hashian are reportedly expecting their first child in January. A photo posted by therock (@therock) on Jun 4, 2015 at 6:18pm PDT\n\n"Dwayne and Lauren couldn't be more thrilled," RadarOnline reports. "They've been rock solid for about nine years now and felt it was time to expand their family."\n\nIt will be the first child for Hashian, a singer-songwriter, and the second for Johnson, 43, who has a 14-year-old daughter, Simone, with ex-wife and college sweetheart, Dany Garcia. \n\nGarcia and Johnson split in 2007 after a 10 year marriage.\n\n"We've been fortunate enough to spend the last 17 years together as a couple and look forward to spending the rest our lives together as best friends and business partners," he said at the time.\n\nJohnson, who has remained friends with Garcia and whose trainer is her new husband, reportedly began dating Hashian that same year.\n\nThe former pro-wrestler turned actor has credited Hashian with helping him to achieve success.\n\n"We do these stories and we talk so much about the business end, the success end, but then Lauren isn't mentioned and my daughter [Simone] isn't mentioned. I always like making sure we find the balance and my home life is in there and Lauren Hashian is in there and my daughter is in there.

0131_3fe5bfa9-20ff-4f69-b1ec-bb9c75fe7a43	A potential death penalty trial in East Texas is set to resume on Monday after it was put on hold when a judge was said by a TV station to have had a shock belt used on the defendant for misbehaving. James Calvert, 45, of Tyler, Texas, is on trial in Smith County, where prosecutors allege he beat and fatally shot his former wife at her home and abducted their 4-year-old son in October 2012. Judge Jack Skeen allowed Calvert to defend himself, over objections from attorneys specializing in the death penalty, at the outset of the trial in August.
0132_8b893a57-1420-4392-b990-e0c0aaf68924	Earlier this week, a soldier from Florida used a GoPro to show that his wife was physically abusing him, resulting in his estranged wife going to jail , according to WTSP-10, a local news Tampa Bay news station. \n\nThe solider, who’s been identified just as Michael in order to protect “his identity since he is a victim of domestic violence,” has been in a custody and divorce battle with his wife, 37-year-old Corinne Novak, WTSP reported. The captured GoPro video shows Novak hitting the solider below the belt during a custody exchange last week. \n\n"This is just one of many instances where I've had to use the camera to either prove her guilt or prove my innocence and that's the only reason I am carrying it," Michael said in the video. \n\nMichael told WTSP that the video will show the courts what his wife has been doing to him, which may solve the long custody battle the former couple has been having over their two 2-year-old daughters. \n\n“We have court coming up so hopefully it goes to show a little bit of validity to what I've been doing and what I've been saying and disapproving what she's been saying," Michael told WTSP. "It seems to be overlooked when the man is a victim of domestic violence." \n\nAlthough women make up the majority of domestic violence cases — close to 1.3 million annually, according to the American Bar Association — about 835,000 men across the United States are domestically abused by their partners every year, the ABA reported. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said about one in seven men suffer intimate partner violence annually. \n\nAccording to Help Guide, a nonprofit organization that aims to help people’s health and well-being, most men tend to be stronger than women, but that doesn’t make it easy to escape an abusive relationship . In fact, men often lack the resources that women do when they’re abused, Help Guide explained. \n\n“An abused man faces a shortage of resources, skepticism from police, and major legal obstacles, especially when it comes to gaining custody of his children from an abusive mother,” according to Help Guide. \n\nMen also face the issue of being “socialized not to express their feelings or see themselves as victims,” according to The National Domestic Violence Hotline. Young boys are taught from a young age to show strength and not express emotions, which makes it difficult for men to recognize the signs that they’re being abused, the NDVH reported. \n\nWarning signs include partners calling them names, preventing them from going to work or threatening them with violence , according to The Mayo Clinic. \n\nSociety tends to treat male domestic violence as a joke, according to the NDVH. An example of this was seen last year when famed rapper Jay-Z was attacked by Solange Knowles, the sister of Jay-Z’s wife, Beyonce Knowles, according to the NDVH. The controversy inspired memes on the Internet and even a song lyric from Beyonce. \n\nDespite society’s views on male domestic violence and the lack of resources, men can find help with domestic abuse problems from a variety of sources. Help Guide recommends talking to physicians, psychologists and therapists on the issue. \n\nLocal authorities may also be a source of help. But men should try to get evidence of the abuse, like Michael did, to prove that they are being attacked since authorities are likely to be skeptical of the issue, Help Guide reported. \n\nMen should also look to leave their relationship to avoid abuse, and they should never retaliate, Help Guide reported. \n\nIt’s also important for men to speak out about their problems, despite societal pressures, according to the Mayo Clinic. This will help other men speak out about their domestic abuse issues, and might spark a societal change where it’s more common to come forward about attacks. \n\n“Start by telling someone about the abuse, whether it's a friend, relative, health care provider or other close contact,” The Mayo Clinic explained. “At first, you might find it hard to talk about the abuse. However, you'll also likely feel relief and receive much-needed support.”
0133_6e03b453-7d91-4e45-971b-d86af601aa9c	Agrium (NYSE:AGU) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Agrium's profit rose in the second quarter of 2015 on higher volumes in its Wholesale unit. However, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues fell year over year on declines across the board, and missed expectations. The company cut its earnings guidance for 2015 factoring in pricing pressure in the second half. The crop pricing environment is expected to remain soft in the near term. Agrium is also faced with issues such as logistical constraints and challenges from higher Chinese urea exports.” \n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Bank of America’s second-quarter 2015 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of lower non-interest expenses as well as increase in interest income and mortgage banking revenues. However, a slump in trading revenues and investment banking fees, and higher provision for credit losses were the headwinds. We expect balance sheet restructuring efforts, expense reduction initiatives and improving asset quality to steadily bolster the company’s bottom-line growth. Further, conditional approval of its capital plan indicates overall balance sheet strength. Nevertheless, pressure on net interest yield, along with lower trading volumes, will continue to hurt top-line growth in the near term.” \n\nBarclays (NYSE:BCS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Barclays’ first-half 2015 results reflected successful cost-curtailment measures and improvement in Investment Banking performance. However, a number of legal provisions and declining net operating income were the undermining factors. The decision to remove Chief Executive Antony Jenkins will likely help the company become more profitable through faster cost-cuts. Nevertheless, the company continues to face several headwinds. Primarily, muted top-line growth and a stringent regulatory landscape will likely weigh on the company’s near-term performance. Also, issues related to regulatory investigations will keep hindering its growth prospects.” \n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “BlackRock’s second-quarter 2015 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by higher revenues. Growth in assets under management (AUM) was another catalyst. However, elevated expenses and long term outflows were the undermining factors. While the company continues to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions to boost performance, its initiatives to enhance market share in the ETF business are expected to aid revenue growth going forward. Also, the company’s enhanced capital deployment activities remain impressive. Nonetheless, weak expense control, high dependence on fee-based revenues and regulatory restrictions on its revenue sources make us apprehensive.” \n\nBP plc (NYSE:BP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, “BP plc’s earnings came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This was mainly due to lower realization. We believe that the company’s strategy of offloading non-core upstream properties will prove beneficial over time, while creating a portfolio with potentially stronger growth from a smaller base. Additionally, BP’s position in the Woodford, Haynesville, Fayetteville, Eagle Ford and Utica shale plays, in association with its vast resource base and profound knowledge in unconventional gas, will aid its natural gas operations going forward.” \n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Citigroup's second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by lower expenses while revenues remained relatively stable. Also, the quarter experienced continued improvement in credit quality and exhibited a strong capital position. We believe the company's streamlining initiatives and attractive core business are impressive. Yet, a low interest-rate environment and regulatory issues, along with litigation risks, remain major near-term headwinds.” \n\nDr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE:DPS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Dr Pepper has sound long-term fundamentals — strong position in the flavored CSD market, aggressive RCI cost savings and regular cash returns to shareholders. After an exceptional performance in 2014, Dr Pepper delivered solid top line and bottom line results in the first half of 2015 on the back of pricing gains, innovations, powerful marketing programs and productivity improvements. Despite increased currency headwinds, the company raised the 2015 sales and EPS expectations. Improving U.S. consumer sentiments, rational pricing environment, increased marketing support and RCI driven cost savings will boost results in the second half. However, sluggish volumes of its carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, due to CSD category headwinds, are the concerns.” \n\nHarmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Harmony Gold posted a wider loss on a reported basis in fourth-quarter fiscal 2015, hurt by a sizable impairment related to its Hidden Valley, Doornkop and Phakisa operations. Adjusted earnings were flat year over year. Revenues fell by double-digits,affected by lower gold sales and pricing. Gold production also declined year over year in the quarter. Harmony's operations are likely to be impacted by a slower-than expected ramp-up in production at mines and gold price volatility. It also remains exposed to geopolitical risks associated with potential mine shut downs and labor strikes.” \n\nIngersoll-Rand PLC (NYSE:IR) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Ingersoll reported disappointing second-quarter 2015 results, as adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.03. Operating risks from high R&D costs for technology-driven products are expected to weigh on margins in the quarters ahead. Moreover, intense competitive pressure and adverse foreign currency impact are likely to hinder its profitability to some extent. However, Ingersoll is realigning its operational structure to improve the long-term growth prospects and capitalize on high-margin opportunities. A disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet, and healthy cash flow remain positives. Ingersoll also expects to strengthen its position in existing markets through organic growth across industry verticals and maintained its earlier guidance for 2015.” \n\nNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Nordstrom reported better-than-expected top and bottom line results for second-quarter fiscal 2015 on the back of smooth execution of its customer strategy coupled with robust sales growth driven by its strategic growth investments. Further, the company raised its outlook for fiscal 2015 encouraged by the strong second-quarter results and the reclassification of receivables as "held for sale" related to the pending credit card transaction. Consequently, the company witnessed an uptrend in estimates. Additionally, we appreciate the company’s store-expansion strategy, which is expected to boost top-line growth. However, the seasonal nature of the company’s business and increased competition from industry players may prove deterrents.” \n\nKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Kinder Morgan, Inc, registered a decline in the earnings and revenue during the second quarter. The company’s focus on natural gas has raised concern amid a sluggish natural gas price environment. We are also cautious considering the risks that include an increase in crude oil production and pricing at the CO2 segment, a decline in refined products or natural gas demand, and rising costs associated with organic growth projects.” \n\nLiberty Global plc – Class A (NASDAQ:LBTYA) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, “Liberty Global reported mixed financial results in the second quarter of 2015 wherein the bottom line fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line steered past the same. The company is predominantly operating in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospect of Liberty Global. The intensely competitive pay-TV market of Germany further adds to the company’s woes. Moreover, high integration risks, mounting programing expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet are major headwinds that face the company presently.” \n\nLyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “LyondellBasell’s profit jumped in the second quarter of 2015 as it benefited from abundant supply of low-cost natural gas. However, revenues fell by double-digits year over year, affected by lower prices of the company’s products. Adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales missed. LyondellBasell remains on track with its expansion projects that are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings. The company also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging healthy cash flows. However, LyondellBasell is exposed to volatility in raw material and energy costs. Lower crude oil prices may also affect its margins in 2015. Moreover, its operations are subject to maintenance outages.” \n\nManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “ManpowerGroup’s second-quarter 2015 earnings per share of $1.33 and revenues of $4,861.3 million handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by encouraging performance in Southern Europe. In addition, the Permanent Recruitment business is doing well with revenues growth of 20% on constant currency basis. However, both the metrics disappointed on a year-over-year basis on account of unfavorable forex fluctuations coupled with weak performing Right Management business. Management expects recovery across globe to be slow and patchy going forward.  As recovery is slow, management has adopted a strong pricing and productivity control approach to ensure uninterrupted profitability.” \n\nMasco Corp (NYSE:MAS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Masco Corporation’s earnings, revenues and margin increased year over year in the first two quarters of 2015. Masco reported strong sales at all segments, except Plumbing, in the first two quarters of 2015. Cost control and productivity improvements drove operating margin. Masco expects stronger demand for its leading products through the rest of 2015, as the repair and remodeling industry continues to improve. Moreover, the cabinet segment, which returned to profitability this quarter, is expected to gain further momentum in the second half of 2015. However, international revenues are being hurt by currency headwinds resulting from a weaker euro compared to the U.S dollar.” \n\nMeredith (NYSE:MDP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Favorable advertising trends in the digital section and recent acquisitions continue to favorably impact Meredith’s performance. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein earnings of $0.94 per share grew 6.8% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the seventh straight quarter. Though revenues of $426 million came almost in line with the estimate, it grew 9% year over year. Waning print media trends and stiff competition continue to be immediate concerns. Nevertheless, Meredith is focused on bolstering advertising revenues, primarily in the digital space, and is increasingly concentrating on brand licensing, marketing services and e-Commerce. Recently, Media General has announced its decision to acquire Meredith.” \n\nMcCormick & Company, (NYSE:MKC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “McCormick delivered better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Earnings of $0.75 per share increased 17% from $0.64 per share earned a year ago, mainly due to a lower tax rate. Higher adjusted operating income, increased income from unconsolidated operations and lower shares outstanding also benefited earnings. Further, the company has raised its earnings guidance, citing favorable tax rates in fiscal 2015. However, revenues lagged the consensus mark and declined year-over-year due to significant foreign currency headwinds. Excluding currency impact, sales grew 5%. McCormick is focusing on building sales through brand marketing investments and acquisitions. However, McCormick remains apprehensive about higher material costs, which can impact 2015 earnings.” \n\nMicrosemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Microsemi Corporation is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. Fiscal third-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Also, forward revenue guidance was encouraging. Microsemi’s compelling products, scope for margin expansion and decent balance sheet are other positives. However, pockets of weakness related to the high-margin satellite business, product transition at medical customers, push-out of some communications spending in China and a softer oil & gas market will impact revenues. Also, heavy investment in R&D could impact near-term profitability.” \n\nMylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Mylan’s second-quarter earnings were better than expected. We are encouraged by strong sales at the Generics segment. Mylan raised its 2015 guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.15 to $4.35.  However, foreign currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact revenues. We remain concerned about the company’s Specialty segment sales. The company expects to face generic competition for EpiPen Auto-Injector in the second half of 2015. Meanwhile, Mylan remains committed to acquiring Perrigo Company and has launched a formal offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo.” \n\nNorthern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Northern Trust’s second-quarter 2015 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from top-line growth and a benefit of credit in provision for credit losses. However, higher expenses and lower net interest margin remained concerns. The company remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value as it announced a dividend hike and a new share repurchase program. Though the thrust of banking regulations might act as deterrents to the company’s fundamentals going forward, strong capital ratios and anticipated increase in asset management and servicing fees based on a significant equity markets improvement and higher volumes are expected to support earnings in the coming quarters.” \n\nNewell Rubbermaid (NYSE:NWL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Newell, which has been delivering positive earnings surprises for over four years now, reported stellar second-quarter 2015 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and exceeded expectations. Also, Newell raised its outlook for 2015 as it remains confident of delivering positive results in the second half of 2015 as well. Further, the company’s Project Renewal Program aimed at achieving annual cost savings, remains on track. Also, Newell’s solid brand portfolio is one of its key strengths. However, the company’s significant global presence exposes it to adverse currency movements. Despite the raised guidance, Newell expects forex headwinds to have a greater impact on its 2015 earnings as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies.” \n\nPotash Corp./Saskatchewan (NYSE:POT) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Potash Corp.’s profit fell in the second quarter of 2015, hurt by lower nitrogen prices.Earnings trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate whiles sales beat expectations. The company cut the top end of its earnings guidance range for 2015 factoring in pricing pressure and weak nitrogen market fundamentals. Potash Corp. faces headwinds associated with macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from weakness across specific developing markets. It is also exposed to challenges in its nitrogen business and a volatile pricing environment.” \n\nToyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Toyota’s first-quarter fiscal 2016 net income and consolidated revenues improved year over year and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Toyota expects its earnings, operating income and revenues to increase in fiscal 2016. The company’s focus on product development, capacity increases and expansion in emerging markets are positives. However, weak vehicle sales in Japan, a string of product recalls and large fines are some headwinds.” \n\nTorchmark (NYSE:TMK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Torchmark's higher administrative expenses, pension costs and investments in IT systems will likely be a drag on the company's earnings over the near term. For 2015, management lowered the projected earnings range to $4.18–$4.28 from $4.20–$4.40 per share. However, niche market focus, steady capital deployment and strong operating fundamentals should drive long-term growth. The company estimates life and health sales growth in distribution channels. Additionally, strong capital position and capital management are also among other positives. With respect to earnings results, Torchmark's second-quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but improved year over year on higher premium contribution from the life as well as insurance business.” \n\nUBS AG (NYSE:UBS) was downgraded by analysts at Deutsche Bank from a buy rating to a hold rating. \n\nXcel Energy (NYSE:XEL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Xcel Energy has been heavily investing in transmission, generation and distribution projects which are expected to boost its performance going forward.  A large portion of the company’s capital expenditure in the next 4 to 5 years will be directed toward strengthening its transmission and natural gas business. Focus on adding renewables will help the company achieve its target of curbing carbon emissions. However, Xcel Energy’s earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2015 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year due to lower revenues on account of unfavorable weather and a decline in residential sales. Apart from uncertain weather patterns, tighter environmental legislations might also limit the company' profitability.” \n\nReceive News & Ratings for Agrium Inc Daily - Enter your email address below to receive a concise daily summary of the latest news and analysts' ratings for Agrium Inc and related companies with MarketBeat.com's FREE daily email newsletter.

0135_1d4d1a14-7eb7-4be4-b1d5-7ac491c61dbd	I’m 56 years old, and I have finally discovered what a “grown-up” relationship really looks like.  I shake my head and try very hard not to regret many of the moments of those 56 years, but I’ve realized in the last year that I had no idea what a real, honest to goodness GROWN UP relationship really was. I have three incredibly horrible/wonderful children, and remind myself every single day how thankful I am for them. It’s because of them that I’ve come to know the real meaning of joy, true love, despair, fear, great pride and gratitude.  It’s also because of those three souls that I can’t regret the many years I spent in an unfortunate marriage.  (If I wasn’t still raw from the fact that someone who shall not be named managed to steal ½ of my TEACHER’S retirement, I might actually thank him for those children.) Last year The Powers That Be took pity on me. They knew I finally loved and respected myself, and I guess they decided I was ready to be loved by someone else.  But this time they sent someone my way who is kind, generous, loving, handsome, funny and who can dance like nobody’s business.  They sent me a real man. You know what I’ve realized a grown-up relationship means? Most of you are probably lucky enough to already know, but I’m going to share my own earth shattering realizations about what a real man in a grown-up relationship really does. First, a real man doesn’t play any crazy games. He doesn’t wait to call you, he doesn’t ignore your text messages or phone calls, and he makes you feel like you are the only and best partner in the world. He loves to hear your voice in the morning, and wants to hear it before he goes to sleep. He reminds you each day that you are important to him and that you are an important part of his life. Second, he’s honest. He tells you when you are wonderful, and when you are sounding a bit crazy. He tells you when you look beautiful and when you might want to donate that well-worn blue dress to the Goodwill.  He admires your children for their strengths, and gently reminds you when they make a misstep.  (Moms are a bit blind in some instances…it’s that maternal component that brings on an occasional bout of blindness.) Third, he makes it easy for YOU to be honest.  He listens to my boring stories, my silly fears and my occasional trips into the world of crazy ranting.  He never makes me feel like I should hide any of these sides of myself, and always has a response that makes me laugh.  Sometimes I think I share WAY TOO MUCH, but that’s because my heart is so at ease with this man.   And while I could go on and on,  do you know one of the best things of all about being in this particular grown-up relationship? (Well, besides the fact that I’m crazy about him…)   He’s decided that he needs to show me a world I’ve never seen before.  And when I say the world, I really mean it. Buckle up, cause vodkamom’s adventures have been raised to an entirely new level.....

0137_f122dac7-4d79-4d19-bac1-88c8f468e33d	Monday on “The Alan Colmes Show,” Alan spoke with Milwaukee Country Sheriff David Clarke about his controversial comments that President Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder were to blame for the death of Deputy Darren Goforth in Texas.  He also discussed why he thinks the #blacklivesmatter protesters across the country are also part of the problem. \n \nSheriff Clarke told Alan why he thinks President Obama has “disdain for the American police officer,” why #blacklivesmatter protesters should be demonstrating in front of abortion clinics and not police stations, and why much of the anti-police sentiment in America is due to the “lie” of “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.”
0138_46cc051e-ab62-46fc-b65c-6ee2fa616c99	10:09 a.m. EDT \n \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain reached the Davis Cup final for the first time in 37 years on Sunday as Andy Murray outclassed Australia's Bernard Tomic in straight sets to give them an unbeatable 3-1 lead. \n \nWorld number three Murray had teamed up with brother Jamie to win a thrilling five-set doubles rubber against Lleyton Hewitt and Sam Groth on Saturday to leave the hosts needing to win just one of Sunday's reverse singles. \n \nThe 28-year-old, who became the first Briton to win the Wimbledon men's singles in 77 years in 2013, duly delivered his third point of the match, beating an increasingly dispirited Tomic 7-5 6-3 6-2 to wild cheers from a partisan Glasgow crowd. \n \nIn doing so, and setting up a final away to Belgium, Murray improved his record in Davis Cup singles to 25-2 -- an impressive contribution and the main reason Britain have risen from the depths of the competition in 2010 to within one victory of their first title since 1936. \n \n"Obviously, winning for your country and your team mates means a lot. The crowd were unbelievable from the first ball to the last," Murray told the BBC. \n \n"I didn't feel great the whole weekend to be honest, I've been struggling with my back, but I just tried to disguise it. We've got everyone here, mother, father, wife, grandmother, mother-in-law, aunties and uncles. \n \n"I'm delighted to get through, we knew this would be difficult, Australia have so much depth and experience but we fought extremely hard all weekend." \n \nMurray's only moment of alarm on Sunday came in the first set when Tomic briefly raised his level, breaking back from 2-5 down to level the set at 5-5. \n \nHowever, the Australian, who is ranked 23 in the world, slipped 0-40 down at 5-6 and, despite saving two set points, was bamboozled by a Murray drop shot. \n \nAfter that the outcome of the match became a formality as a clearly tired Murray managed to dominate. \n \nAustralia captain Wally Masur said Murray had been the difference between the sides. \n \n"Andy was like a locomotive this weekend," he said. \n \n"I think you walk away from those ties and say: 'Where do we need to get better?' and 'What do I need to improve?'. I think Andy showed our boys." \n \nMurray will need to summon one final effort at the end of the season when Britain will face Belgium, probably in Brussels, on Nov. 27-29 after they edged past Argentina 3-2 on Sunday. \n \n(Reporting by Martyn Herman in London; editing by Clare Fallon and Ken Ferris)
0139_b18df561-a32f-433e-b141-c1e586dcf364	ST. LOUIS -- With the Pittsburgh Pirates not letting up, the St. Louis Cardinals have little margin for error in the National League Central.But St. Louis had Jaime Garcia on the mound Saturday night and that - coupled with a big first inning - was more than enough for it to maintain its lead.Checking the Milwaukee Brewers on seven hits and a run over eight innings, Garcia became the fifth Cardinals starter to reach double figures in wins in a 5-1 victory at sold-out Busch Stadium.Garcia (10-5), who walked none and fanned eight, beat Milwaukee for the third time since Aug. 8. The only trouble he experienced occurred in the sixth, when rookie outfielder Michael Reed doubled in his first big league at-bat and later scored on a single by first baseman Jonathan Lucroy.The result enabled St. Louis (98-57) to hold its three-game lead on Pittsburgh, a 4-0 winner Saturday at the Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals and Pirates meet in Pittsburgh for a three-game series starting Monday night.Rookie starter Tyler Wagner (0-1) gave up six hits and five runs over four innings in his second big league start for the Brewers (65-90). Wagner walked four and struck out Carnone. St. Louis roared out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning. Left fielder Matt Holliday laced an RBI double to the wall in left-center, followed two batters later by a run-scoring single from shortstop Jhonny Peralta. Second baseman Kolten Wong capped the rally with a two-run single.Holliday ripped his second RBI double an inning later to make it 5-0.Garcia cruised through the first five innings, yielding just two singles and walking none with five strikeouts. NOTES: St. Louis RHP Carlos Martinez (right shoulder tightness) is being shut down for the year, but won't need surgery. Martinez, who finished 14-7 with a 3.01 ERA in his first year as a starter, left Friday night's game after seven pitches. ... Milwaukee RF Ryan Braun (lower back tightness) returned to the starting lineup for the first time since Sept. 18. Braun pinch-hit Friday night. ... Cardinals RHP Adam Wainwright (left Achilles) threw 27 pitches in a simulated game, recording strikeouts of 1B Matt Adams and OF Randal Grichuk. Wainwright, who also worked on fielding and covering first base, could pitch next week during a trip to Pittsburgh and Atlanta.

0141_f97d0baf-09f1-4b6d-bbe6-0f0402de1aae	It's 5 o' clock in the evening. The sky is dotted with a plethora of colours. It seems that a myriad of hues have carelessly been splashed on a canvas, the end product being a striking and stunning palette of colours. Shifting our vision downward to earth, to rooftops specifically, numerous young children and young-at-heart adults can be spotted laughing, playing, running about and most importantly, thoroughly enjoying themselves and having fun, all the time holding a reel of thread in their hands. Now and then, a cry of “bho katta!”  is heard. Oh, the joy and delight experienced on cutting someone else's line and seeing their kite floating off into the vast horizon. Alas, this type of scene isn't too common anymore.  \n \nIn a world that is becoming increasingly virtual, where tech-savvy kids prefer staying indoors rather than playing a sport outside, the art of kite flying has become a lost art. These days, how many kids do we know who indulge in flying kites as a pastime? How many shops do we encounter in the local market or bazaar, which sells kites? \n \n Truth be spoken, the answers to both the above questions would be near to none. Presently, kites are flown only on special occasions like Vishwakarma Puja or in organised kite festivals. \n \nThe kite traces its roots to China, where the materials ideal for kite building were easily available namely silk fabric for sail material, fine, high-tensile strength silk for flying lines and flexible bamboo for a strong yet light framework.  \n \nFrom China, traders to Korea and across Asia to India eventually spread kite flying. There are quite a few variations to the designs of kites, they are the Deltas, the triangular kites, easy flyers for low to medium winds, the Serpents and Dragons with long, graceful flowing tails, the visually striking Rokkakus, a traditional Japanese design, and finally the Diamonds, the classic kite design.  \n \nAll these can be seen at the various kite festivals held all around the world. Be it the Japan kite festival, or those in China and Jakarta, Indonesia, each of them are an integral part of the local culture and have a widespread appeal.  \n \nThe highly acclaimed Washington State International Kite Festival and the International Kite Festival of India in Gujarat attract thousands of competitors as well as spectators from around the world.  \n \nMy first encounter with kites was at my grandparents' house, when I was about two years old. My grandfather used to stack a pile of kites of several colour to choose from, he used to do this every time we visited them.  \n \nAlthough I had no clue about how to fly a kite, the feeling of running with a kite in one hand and the reel in the other, the wind caressing my face and my hair flying, was pure bliss and joy in itself. My kite never left the ground!  \n \nAnd till today, I haven't been successful in getting a kite up in the air. But then, there’s hope yet. \n \nDiotima Roy, Class X, DPS Ruby Park \n \nSky battles \n \nI am accustomed to my daily waking up at six o 'clock when a new grey morning summons me with fervour. I sit for some time on my broad window-sill engaged in my usual overwhelming caprice.  \n \nHowever one day some unknown force compelled me to stay a bit longer near the window and gaze mysteriously at the endless sky and attempt hard to make out the skyline. The silvery majestic outline of the moon found its place in the vast sky. \n \nMy commendations for these little beauties became intense when abruptly my eye caught the view of a minute object in constant motion.  That was a kite. It gyrated vigorously and then rose higher and higher. I figured out an urchin on the roof of his decrepit house adroitly manipulating the non-living flying object that was crimson coloured with a glittery silver border and a long frail mustard coloured ribbon for tail creating tortuous motion in the air. The air seemed extremely pleasurable with no extreme turbulence or pure stagnancy. The sun appeared to have taken a day's repose. \n \nGradually there appeared another kite; analogously larger in dimension painted with a thin coat of indigo hue and black horizontal stripes pasted impetuously on its surface. It had no ribbons.  \n \nA fierce rumpus commenced and the two inanimate objects were soon engaged in a grapple where the sky volunteered to serve as the battleground and the kites were the soldiers thriving hard to overcome the hindrance. Ponderously kites engulfed the sky and the battle grew heftier. After some time there was a screech or two followed by dismantling of a kite that swirled round and descended over a still moss-enveloped pond. Alas, the soldier capitulated to its mighty opponent. Instantly a thunderous howl echoed in the alleyway and a sea of young folk emerged to have a look at the vista.  \n \nWhat a great raging sky battle! I desperately wished to be a part of this surging combat in which we find ourselves defeated optimistically; a battle in which we know no physical maltreat but pure mental stability; a battle in which we have no winner but a survivor; a battle we all crave for: the sky battle. \n \nHrishita Chatterjee, Class XI, St Teresa's Secondary School, Khidderpore \n \nIf only I were a kite... \n \nWhen I was 10 years old, I had read about the Phoenix somewhere - about its mythological significance and magical immortality. Since then I have always had a strange jealousy for flying objects - be it birds or aeroplanes. \n \nMay be that is why when I went to the terrace the other day to vent my the heaviness in my heart in the cool autumn winds, I happened to have forgotten all my miseries, staring fixedly at a red object flying in the sky, looking like a red dot in an azure ocean. It was a kite- a medium sized, diamond shaped kite that was painted in a thick red paint from head to tail and highlighted with a solid black circle at its centre. It was held in space by an almost invisible thread that originated somewhere behind the bushy, green coconut trees. I had been staring at it for sometime while churning my grievances in my mind when suddenly, my brows stitched in anger at the flying kite. Another flying thing. How I seemed to dislike it. \n \nI was wondering why was it dancing before my gaze high up in the heavens when I was not even interested in it. It floated in the sky, occasionally fluttering because of the wind, and soaring again like an artificial bird. Soon the neighbourhood responded to this colour in the sky and kites were seen emerging on the distant horizon like enemy flags progressing for the battle field. A yellow in the north west corner and two greens - one emerald painted, the other in shades of olive- flew into the sky (it seemed like an arena) from the south and soon all of them flew together in the air harmoniously.  \n \nThen suddenly the emerald kite made a quick progress towards the yellow one while the string of the yellow kite could be seen being pulled. Awed by the excitement I strained my eyes when the yellow one sliced through the invisible thread of the emerald's and flew away while the torn kite now sailed down the heavens and managed to tangle itself in one of the branches of the mango tree in the neighbourhood. \n \nFor a moment, I laughed. Having forgotten all my worries, I was so immersed in the kites that I had never noticed the long missed smile on my face. I wished I were a kite too. \n \n One that could soar in the skies fearlessly and trip over coconut tree tops. I wish I would be like it, gathering no moss from the hardships that came my way instead floating down to the earth, accepting my defeat wholeheartedly.  \n \nI wish I were a kite which could be as patient while waiting for a soul to gear up my spirits or may be have a heart that never lost its colours despite the wait for a human friend.  \n \nI wish I were a kite that would refrain to show its feelings even at being torn or which would believe in oneself while lying on the ground, waiting to join its company in the sky.  \n \nAhendrila Goswami, Class XII, Bishop Morrow School, Krishnagar \n \nFlying dreams \n \nSunset is turning the sky a golden orange. Inside the congested four walls of my room, one can look straight at the lamp post. There seems to be a conversation going on between two crows. Suddenly some yellow frames bloom onto the scene.  \n \nOverhead the sky is fast changing into different colours. Beside the highway, are large pandals and inside is the one with four hands, sitting with a 'latai and ghuri' (spool and kite) in his hand. Wishes are flying in the sky.  \n \nWe can never be birds. \n \nLook at the sky. Our dream is to be a bird, of flying in the sky. But I feel like a prisoner. The10ft/10ft room has blocked me. But in my childhood days, I used to run with the kite in my hand to send it off the sky.  \n \nThose days are lost. Where did all those friends go with whom I would spend hours with kites? Where did that big ground disappear, the green grass, and all our flying kites in the sky? See, how a kite is racing to catch another one and if it catches by chance, it's “bhokatta”! But the dreams end here.  \n \nAnother 'moyurponkhi' in the sky, 'the flying dream'. In our life also there is the same kinds of 'ups and downs'. Look at the boy in tattered clothes running to catch a 'kata ghuri', running and running. And when he catches the kite, his dream will be fulfilled.  Gradually darkness is covering the sky. \n \nThe lights are being lit up in the pandals. But at the extreme western point, even now different colours paint the sky. See, there is still that kite, 'a flying dream'. \n \nAnkita Mukherjee, Class XII, Coordinator, Vivekananda English Academy \n \nImagination is the highest kite that can fly, but the flight could be far more enjoyable, if one could only imagine. Kites have always offered a pure pleasure. People fly kites in different countries to make the festivals colourful, which on the other hand add freshness to life. Most likely, in Japan Children's Day on 5 May, New Year's programme of Korea, March festivals of Thailand, China's Lighting Festivals, America's spring festivals witness the same. \n \nIn India, Mughal emperors used to fly kites for their enjoyment. Now, in every state the kite flying competition is being carried on. In Patanga-nagar of Ahmedabad, there is an international Kite Flying Competition, which is organised every year. \n \nIn our country the kite is being used in favour of national integration, anti-religious conflict. In Bengal, the Kite-flying celebration particularly marks the occasion of Viswakarma-Puja. Various people had used kites for various measures. Some used it as symbol for defiant euphoria and hence to resist attack, some for experimentation while some for mere fun.  About 50 years back, kite-flying was a tremendous exciting carefree game in Bengal rural areas as it involved manufacturing of kite, then binding and adjusting the balance. \n \n Manufacturing the thread involves collection of glass pieces mostly of electric bulb or the pieces of the streetlights, or of train. Then a dust of it was made by iron mortar and pestle and the finer dust is collected. The moist sago is then boiled for a considerable time and when it is in semi-solid stage, the identifying colour is added and it is allowed to cool.  \n \nThen the reel of thread is held at one end, and collected on a spool by another. In the middle, one boy is supposed to hold the sago paste in his palm and one experienced boy holds the glass dust with the help of a cotton cloth. The sago paste has to be drawn up into the thread by rolling the spool. The thread is mixed with sago paste, then dust of glass is added and becomes sharp. Then the threads are tugged tightly from one post to another.  And we get the reinforced string prepared for kites.   \n \nBut times have changed. There are none around for engaging in such laborious activities. Leave alone preparing the strong glass-dust thread, very few boys can be found chasing kites and returning with whoops of joy on getting hold of one. \n \nAnnesha Chatterjee, Coordinator, Class IX, Kalyani University Experimental School, Kalyani
0142_df6c4181-8639-4674-a0c7-881114f8a6a8	By now we’ve forgotten the State Fair entirely, and want nothing to do with it. Autumn is here and we must be industrious and orient ourselves towards Omnipresent Pumpkin Spice Season. Oh, it’s nice today; it would be a good day at the Fair, even though the breeze had an undertone of chill in the morn. Noon feels warm, but that’s not going to last. \n \nIt’s possible you’ll go back to the Fairgrounds for something or other. I used to go to an Arts & Crafts event in the fall - and of course there’s the Back to the Fifties event in June, which occupies the Fairgrounds with so much gorgeous metal you really don’t see the bones of the Fair at all, even though they’re all there. In the Fall, however, it seems wrong to go there. It’s like going home and finding every store downtown empty and shuttered. Your parents moved away and didn't leave a forwarding address. \n \nAnyway: here’s a picture I never got around to posting. I like it because it’s shorthand, and everyone knows what it means. \n  \nBut only because it’s an Italian restaurant. If you saw IT GAR BR on an auto-parts store, you’d be completely confused. \n \nSomeone who's just learning English might be confused, though. What's a Meatbaii? \n \nCOMICS The creator of Marmaduke explains his appeal: \n “He’s not a talking dog,” Mr. Anderson said. “He doesn’t have a balloon above his head, he doesn’t walk on his hind legs. He walks and does things a real dog would do.”  \nMarmaduke has been around since 1954. His creator, Brad Anderson, has died at the age of 91. The obit concludes with the saddest thing you might read today. \n Mr. Anderson said that his cartoon helped fill a void for older people who could no longer keep an animal.“I get a lot of letters from people who are in retirement homes, and sometimes they can’t keep a dog anymore, so this is their pet,” he said. “They watch the paper for it, and they clip it out and put it in scrapbooks.”  \nSigh. \n \nTECH The Apple Event yesterday generated the usual coverage: They’re not innovating any more, and Steve Jobs would be unhappy. Well, the Fall event is usually about the second version of the latest phone - fine-tuning, not reinvention. As for Steve Jobs weeping from the great beyond because they’re selling a Stylus, well, Jobs was not an infallible being, and made a number of design mistakes, from the hockey-puck mouse to the irritating little thumb-wheel volume control on QuickTime. (I raise a glass to other UI nerds who remember such pointless things.) If you want a Stylus, they are making the best one you’d use. If you don’t want one you don’t need it. As for the keyboard, OF COURSE it’s just like a Surface. I have a friend who uses a Surface because he’s in the PC world and loves the keyboard; it’s his everyday out-and-about computer. The iPad cannot be your everyday out-and-about computer because typing on glass is a pain. My wife uses an iPad for everything, and she uses a Bluetooth computer. Whatever works. \n \nThe real news is the Apple TV upgrade. Yes, a new remote is not MIND-BLOWING INNOVATION, except for the part about voice control and a glass-panel trackpad for navigation. I use the AppleTV every day, and like the idea of the app store and voice control, especially for my wife, who tires of going click-click-click through the alphabet to find a show. \n \nIf the Roku has the ability to read your mind right now, I don’t particularly care, and if you prefer a Roku to AppleTV I don’t particularly care, either: enjoy your choice! Who cares what other people like?
0143_f2eccbef-f8e3-4217-867e-6a97a73121f2	Same-sex marriage was supposed to be a settled matter in America -- it's a constitutional right -- but the issue returned to headlines this month after a Kentucky county clerk refused to license those nuptials. \n \nHere are eight things to know about Kim Davis, who spent five days in jail for refusing to abide by this summer's historic ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage. The same judge who jailed her for contempt ordered her release on Tuesday. Kim Davis is the elected clerk of Rowan County in northeastern Kentucky, along the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. \n\nShe is a Democrat who was first elected last fall with 3,909 votes, or 53% of the vote. The county has 23,655 residents. \n\nThough on the job only since January, Davis is hardly new to its demands. \n\nHer mother was the county clerk for 37 years, and Davis worked 27 years for her. \n\nDavis, 49, has spent her entire life in Rowan County, where 96% of people are white and more than one-fourth live in poverty. \n\nWhy was she jailed? \n\nDavis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, defying the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that legalized same-sex marriage. \n\n"It is not a light issue for me. It is a heaven or hell decision," Davis said in a statement, citing her religion. \n\nDavis doesn't want her name and title affixed to a same-sex marriage license "that goes down in the annals of Kentucky history," said her attorney, Mat Staver. \n\nOn September 3, U.S. District Court Judge David Bunning declared Davis in contempt of court for refusing to issue the licenses and not allowing her six deputy clerks to issue them for her. He said Davis would remain behind bars until she complied. \n\nFive of her deputies then agreed to issue marriage licenses in her absence, and the Rowan County Clerk's Office began doing so the following day. \n\nThe sixth deputy is Davis' son, Nathan, who didn't give an answer when he appeared in court to discuss whether he would issue same-sex marriage licenses. \n\nDavis' defense failed to sway the judge. \n\n"You can't be separated from something that's in your heart and in your soul," she told the judge, according to CNN affiliate WKYT-TV. \n\nWhy was she released? \n\nJudge Bunning said in his order Tuesday that he is satisfied the office is issuing marriage licenses to "legally eligible couples," and ordered that counsel for the five deputy clerks who agreed to issue such licenses to submit a status report every 14 days to ensure that compliance continues. \n\nBunning ordered Davis not to interfere "directly or indirectly" with the efforts of her deputies in those duties, and that "appropriate sanctions will be considered" if she fails to comply with the order. \n\nWhat is her faith? \n\nDavis experienced a religious conversion 4½ years ago and became an Apostolic Christian, a faith which has a strict moral code. She attends Solid Rock Apostolic Church in Morehead, the county seat. \n\n"She said she played in the devil's playground for a long time, and her life has been radically changed since then," attorney Staver said. \n\nShe has been married four times, including twice to the same man. \n\n"I am not perfect. No one is," Davis said in a statement. "But I am forgiven and I love my Lord and must be obedient to him and to the word of God." \n\nWill she resign or step down? Can she be fired? \n\nThe governor has no legal authority to remove Davis and cannot use an executive order to relieve her of statutory duties, he said. \n\nDuring Davis' time in jail, her attorney said the county clerk has no intention of resigning. \n\n"She will remain the clerk of Rowan County as long as the people want her," Staver said.

Reuters/Carlos Barria    \nU.S. President Barack Obama will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement reached in July, the White House said on Wednesday. \n\nThe announcement was in response to a Republican bill introduced in Congress that would prevent the president from providing sanctions relief to Iran until $40 billion dollars in restitution has been paid to American victims of Iranian-backed terrorism. \n \n  \n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Julia Edwards )
0151_53308703-b9bb-4162-a73a-036c3affe3aa	9/29/2015 \n \nPROVIDENCE - President Obama is encouraging all 4th-graders to explore the nation's recreational areas, including the Roger Williams National Memorial in Providence, through the new federal Every Kid In a Park initiative. \n \nFourth-grade students can go to www.everykidinapark.gov to do an activity and obtain a free annual entry pass to more than 2,000 federal recreation areas and national parks. Students and their families can use the pass through Aug. 31, 2016. The website also includes fun and engaging learning activities aligned to educational standards, trip planning tools, safety and packing tips and other important and helpful information for educators and parents. \n \nThe goal of the Every Kid in a Park program is to connect 4th-graders with the great outdoors and inspire them to become future environmental stewards, ready to preserve and protect national parks and other public lands for years to come. It is part of the National Park Service's centennial celebration in 2016. \n \n"During the National Park Service's centennial celebration, we want everyone to get to know their national parks, and we're offering a special invitation to 4th-graders and their families to discover everything that national parks offer," said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis. "We hope these free passes for 4th-graders will introduce 4th-graders, their classes, and families to our national treasures, places where they can run and play, explore and learn." \n \nEvery Kid in a Park is an administrative-wide effort, launched by President Obama, and supported by eight federal agencies, including the National Park Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Education, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \nThe Roger Williams National Memorial, at 282 North Main St., in Providence, offers a variety of educational programs and activities for students. For more information on the memorial, visit www.nps.gov/rowi/learn/education/index.htm or call 401-521-7266.
0152_73a34d75-3fc5-4047-91c3-b0cce6f7c1da	WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration says the fingerprints of 5.6 million people who applied for or received a federal security clearance were stolen -- not 1.1 million as first believed. \n\nThat sobering news comes from the Office of Personnel Management, the federal personnel agency whose data was hacked in what officials believe was a Chinese espionage operation. \n\nAn estimated 21.5 million current and former federal employees or job applicants were affected in a data theft that experts say will give Chinese intelligence a huge leg up in recruiting informants. It could also help the Chinese catch U.S. spies. \n\nThe agency says the ability of an U.S. adversary to misuse fingerprint data is limited. But for intelligence operatives, the notion that the Chinese have their fingerprints is a nightmare.
0153_06f4b172-0ef7-4a11-9e4f-07f24152e425	(CNN) -  \nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent target of some of Jimmy Fallon's barbs, showed an easy rapport with the host on "The Tonight Show" Monday night, armed with an amusing anecdote about his New Hampshire visit with the Romneys and the Rubios and joking about the upcoming CNN GOP presidential debate. \n \nHe also took a couple lighthearted shots at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. \n\nDeclaring he was "fired up" to be on the show, the 2016 candidate opened the interview by insisting on participating in one of the show's notorious lip sync battles. But Christie was quickly shut down after launching into the opening lines of "Born in the U.S.A." by his famously beloved Bruce Springsteen, with Fallon slamming the buzzer and declaring Christie the winner. \n\nChristie, winking at his slipping poll numbers, quipped, "Wow, my first first place! That's really good." \n\nThe New Jersey governor also shared a story from his stay at Mitt Romney's lakeside home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, over the Fourth of July weekend, during which he was accompanied by fellow 2016 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio and his family. Christie described a spontaneous boating trip to a local ice cream store gone awry, whereupon arriving at the shop with a small horde of children and grandchildren, he, Romney and Rubio discovered, uncomfortably, that they had forgotten to bring enough money to pay for the crowd's ice cream demands. \n\n"So Mitt Romney turns to me and he says, 'By the way, do you have any money?' Mitt Romney! Right?," Christie joked. "I said, 'No, I don't have any money, I didn't know we were going for ice cream.'" He continued, "So he turns to Rubio and he says, 'Do you have any money?' Rubio goes, 'I don't have any money.'" \n\nThen came the punchline: "So...our wives are walking behind us, and finally we hear a voice from behind going, 'Don't worry, would-be presidents, I have it handled.' And it was Ann Romney. She had the money." \n\nThe would-be president also addressed the domination of the crowded 2016 GOP field by Donald Trump during the interview. Asked by Fallon if he had expected Trump's surge in the polls, Christie sarcastically replied "Oh, no, I completely expected that -- didn't you?" \n\nThe governor then teased the GOP frontrunner over his notorious self-confidence, breaking into his best Trump impression to add, "Of course. Everything he does is fabulous, spectacular, wonderful, amazing." \n\nLater in the interview, Christie discussed his performance in the first GOP presidential debate and his plans for the second debate, scheduled to take place on CNN on September 16. \n\nComplaining about the lack of opportunities to speak, he noted that during the first debate "There was one point where I went twenty questions in a row without being asked a question. And that's hard." \n\n"I'm standing up there next to Marco Rubio and we're looking at each other and going, 'Are we still here?'" \n\nBut Christie promised to make his presence felt at the second debate. "By the way, stay tuned on September 16th. We may be changing tactics. If I go -- if I get to fifteen questions in a row -- count them at home -- if I get that fifteen in a row, they're gonna go 'Uh-oh, he's going nuclear now,'" adding "if I turn green and get the hulk thing going." \n\nThe second GOP presidential debate will take place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Fingers crossed for an appearance by the hulk.
0154_77b5fa0d-36ae-4bc8-aba9-ba87a946ec04	A 17-year-old Syrian refugee has walked more than 300 miles carrying his pet dog after he could not bear to leave the animal in his war-torn homeland. \n \nAslan, from Damascus, was interviewed by the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) after arriving on the Greek island of Lesbos. \n  \n  I love my dog! \n"Some people will ask - you have only a small bag?""Yes.""And you bring your dog?""Yes.""Why?""I love my dog!"Many animal lovers will relate to this 17-year-old boy from Damascus, Syria. And we've seen many like him carrying their animals with them on the long journey from Syria, across the Mediterranean Sea and through Europe. When forced to flee home because of war, many people would never dream of leaving their pets behind. \nPosted by UNHCR on Saturday, 19 September 2015   \nHolding the tiny dog as it yapped happily in his arms, he said: "I love this dog, I need her." \n \nThe teenager said he had walked at least 500km carrying all his belongings in a rucksack, and holding the dog in a red carrier. \n \n"The dog is Rose," Aslan said, holding up his pet's animal passport, before giving her a drink from his water bottle. \n \n"They said 'you can't take your dog'. I have food and I have water, I have everything." \n \nWhen asked by aid workers why he did not leave Rose in Syria, he replied: "I love my dog. \n \nA spokesperson for the UNHCR said it had seen "many" refugees like Aslan carrying their animals with them on dangerous journeys from the Middle East, across the Mediterranean and onwards through Europe. \n \n"When forced to flee home because of war, many people would never dream of leaving their pets behind," she added. \n \nOf the 300,000 refugees and migrants who have arrived in Greece so far this year, more than 93,000 have landed in Lesbos, where the infrastructure is unable to cope. \n  \n  Aslan was continuing his journey from the Greek island of Lesbos, into Europe with Rose   \nEric Kempson, 60, has worked with his wife and teenage daughter to transform their home into an impromptu base of operations for humanitarian efforts. \n \n"I'm here and I'm a human being," he told The Independent. \n \n"When you see these babies suffering you can't just watch." \n \nA five-year-old girl was among more than a dozen Syrian refugees believed to have died on Saturday when their dinghy sank on the way from Turkey to the island. \n \nMany of the refugees and migrants reaching Greek islands continue their journey through the Western Balkan route, which is becoming increasingly difficult after Hungary closed its border with Serbia and other countries started increasing controls. \n \nThe UN estimates that 80 per cent of the people entering Europe through the Balkans are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, with the remainder from a range of countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burundi and in Sub-Saharan Africa. \n \nAccording to UNHCR figures,  more than 442,440 people have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe so far this year and 2,921 have died attempting the voyage.

Buy Angst . \n \nThe Beast [ La bête ] (1975): An aristocratic French woman has sex with a Beast who is stalking the countryside.

0156_cfbd4e36-e28d-4741-b87a-4b935fd9e613	Donald Trump has always been an overly-opinionated media whore with way too much to say about everything.  But, once upon a time, he was capable of occasional moments of good sense.\nWith Us:\nTrump has said he supports women's rights and is "strongly pro-choice."   He has been in favor of single-payer national health care. He has acknowledged the need for higher tax rates on higher incomes. Has said that Hillary Clinton "would be good" as a leader. Has said he is "more of a Democrat than people might think." Has said he has "no idea" why he's a Republican. Against Us:\nThose comments are from some time ago.  Sadly, today's Trump has reversed his positions on all of the above.   Recent surveys show that the large majority of his supporters believe that Obama is a Muslim who was not born in the U.S., want to repeal the 14th Amendment and eliminate birthright citizenship, and are in favor of deporting all immigrant children immediately. Which means most of Trump's supporters are low-information idiots and racists.
0157_87dc4a59-3fac-4de7-ba28-f72b8da4d5ca	With thousands of Syrian refugees and other migrants finally reaching havens in Germany and other European countries – and thousands more arriving daily – the Obama administration says it's "actively considering" ways to help, including allowing more refugees into the U.S. \n \nThe migrant crisis has placed stress on infrastructure in Greece, Macedonia and Hungary – and it has also highlighted divisions between European Union countries. \n \nWhile Germany's vice chancellor said Tuesday that his country could accept at least 500,000 migrants annually, he also called for other European countries to do more. But in Hungary, where a bottleneck had trapped thousands of migrants in large camps before neighboring borders were opened, t the prime minister is urging the completion of a 13-foot fence at its border with Serbia before the end of this year. \n \n"Hungary says the migrants are mostly fleeing bad economic conditions, and don't need asylum status to protect their lives," NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports. "Hungarian police are hindering migrants in their trek through southeast Europe towards the West. Romania says migrant quotas are not the solution; the E.U. says countries must come together in solidarity if Europe is to surmount the crisis." \n \nOn Monday, both France and Britain pledged to accept thousands of migrants – but the numbers – 24,000 for France and 20,000 for Britain – are vastly different from the pace set by Germany, which over this past weekend welcomed at least 20,000 migrants . Chancellor Angela Merkel also said that Germany is devoting $6.7 billion to cope with the crisis. \n \nAs for what steps the U.S. might take, the White House says it is looking at "a range of approaches to be more responsive to the global refugee crisis, including with regard to refugee resettlement." \n \nThe administration adds that with the U.S. having provided over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance since the Syrian crisis began, and over $1 billion in assistance this year, "The U.S. is the single largest donor to the Syrian crisis." \n \nSo far in 2015, more than 367,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seek safety and better prospects in Europe, according to the UN Refugee Agency . Of that number, more than 244,000 made their landing in Greece; at least 121,000 reached Italy. \n \nThe UN agency says the number of migrants rose sharply in August, to nearly 130,000.
0158_cfe07b42-a15c-4607-bf79-4bf2bbd729ea	It’s hard to play better than Tom Brady did Thursday night. \n \nYet despite the New England Patriots quarterback’s  elite performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers, there still are two NFL quarterbacks who will have him beat this season. \n \nThat’s the consensus of 28 executives from around the league, who were asked by NFL.com’s Albert Breer in August to predict who the NFL’s top five quarterbacks  will be at season’s end. Here were their responses: \n \n1. Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers \n2. Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts \n3. Tom Brady, Patriots \n4. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers \n5. Tony Romo, Dallas Cowboys \n \nPatriots fans might disagree, but it’s hard to argue with putting Rodgers and Luck at the top of the heap. Breer asked the executives not to factor in past history when making their decisions, and they had particularly high praise for Rodgers, who received 18 of 28 first-place votes. \n \n“He’s so smart, so accurate, so competitive, such a fast decision maker,” an NFC exec told Breer. “And I know it’s generic to say a lot of this, but he really is a 10 out of 10 in a lot of categories.” \n \nLeague executives did acknowledge Brady will be especially motivated this season — something we certainly found out in Week 1 — and that he isn’t exactly a guy you want to face in a big game. \n \n“I think he’s coming back with a chip on his shoulder, like he did after they lost a couple games early last year,” an NFC exec said of Brady. “He’s such a competitor — no one like him — and he’s got the proven track record. And I think what I’d based it on is, of all these guys, I sure don’t want to be playing against him.” \n \nA notable name left out of the Top 5: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who NFL executives ranked 6th. \n \nThumbnail photo via Mark L.

0159_8f7e2dac-23d4-412e-882b-ba3840ee2bdd	Promotional Products have been around for a very long time, we figure it would be interesting to see the evolution of promotional products since they first made their debut in 1789!\n\n1789 - George Washington created commemorative buttons to mark the event that he was elected president. Because of the success in his campaign, wooden promotional items such as almanacs, calendars, rulers and wooden items became popular.\n1864 - A ferrotype with a locking pin was made for Abraham Lincoln the year he was reelected.  This pin was sold by vendors at campaign rallies or sold in small quantities to vendors.\n\n1886 - A man by the name of Jasper Meek is known to most as the father of the industry of promotional products.  Meek was a newspaper salesman who wanted to keep his presses running during slow times.  After seeing a child drop her schoolbooks on a dirt road, he had an idea that he would use his printing press to print advertising messages on burlap bags.  He sold the bags to his friend Mr. Cantwell who gave the bags out for free to children who came into his store.  The end result?  Mr. Cantwell's message: "Buy Cantwell Shoes" was seen all over town and Meek found a way to stay busy during his slow season.\n\n1889 - Meek had a good streak of selling his bags without competition until another newspaper salesman, Henry D. Beach decided he was going to start printing advertising messages on anything that could be ran through a printing press: aprons, caps, hats for horses, bags for marbles, buggy whips, card cases, calendars and fans.\n\n1896 - The first presidential election to mass-produce campaign buttons\n\nSecond Part of the 19th Century - Adolphus Busch, helped pioneer more than the Anheuser-Busch company.  When Busch's salesmen went to taverns to sell Busch's products, Busch sent them with logoed items like corkscrews and pocket knives, to give to their potential and current customers.\n\n1920's - The first bobblehead to be used for promotional purpose was one created for the New York Knicks.\n\n1936- The Chevrolet garage sent out a photographic postcard with their advertising message of 12 lube jobs for $6 in time payments.\n\n1937 - After polyurethane was first synthesized in response to the demand for a rubber substitute during World War II, stress relievers were developed.\n\nAfter 1930's - 2000's - Pens, coffee mugs, bumper stickers, post-its, etc became popular throughout the years.\n\n2008 - President Barack Obama created an online store with promotional SWAG - this was a different take on presidential election campaigning.\n\n2008 - Present - More and more products are available to print logos on than ever before.  With over 25,000 products to choose from and different kinds of inks used for print (example: UV Ink), the promotional products industry has evolved extensively in the United States alone, since the first promotional button was created for our first president.
0160_181cf8d2-940d-4be6-8530-be7a4fc27a20	click to enlargesnowflock/ThinkstockGood reporting lets readers draw their own conclusions, and that's a good thing.After reading Aimee Levitt’s Reader cover story on rape at the University of Chicago, I sent her a note to say how much I admired it. What followed was an exchange of e-mails that exposed differences of perspective rooted in age and sex. I wondered if Aimee was beginning to think I actually didn't like her story much at all. But the story's greatest virtue was that it didn't tell me what I had to think about it. Some writers put their heads down, snort, and charge the reader. If ambiguity gets in their way they trample it out. Although rape invites didacticism, Aimee didn’t do that. Other writers love ambiguity so much they refuse to sully it by coming to any point at all. Aimee didn’t do that either. She empathized with her characters’ traumas and struggles but she allowed them to be complicated and inconsistent. In our e-mails we sounded like two people arguing over mutual friends whom they both feel they’ve come to understand better than the friends understand themselves.\nA journalist can’t afford to be an unreliable narrator, and Aimee’s reporting is meticulous. Yet she’s reticent. She gave me space. It’s the literary device of allowing the reader to write the story as he or she reads it. I saw this device at work a second time this week, in an essay in the Tribune. (It ran previously in the Washington Post.) "I gave my daughter up for adoption. Then I tried to be her mom," is the title of the op-ed by Stephanie Andersen, a creative writing teacher in Pennsylvania who became pregnant at 16 and gave up the baby to a couple who couldn’t conceive. What we’re told: She stayed in touch with her daughter’s new parents, read their letters and studied their pictures. And when her daughter Eli was ten, Andersen welcomed her for a visit. These visits multiplied; when Andersen married, Eli was a junior bridesmaid. But when Andersen gave birth to a second daughter, Sophia, Eli’s disposition changed and she became sullen and angry. She announced she hated her family, and—Andersen tells us almost in passing—"after her mother moved out, she said she felt even more alone." Eli actually moves in with Andersen when she turns 18. She enrolls in a local college, waits tables, and warms to Sophia. Andersen finally feels at peace. But it doesn’t last. Eli drops out of school and heads north to find her adoptive father. And now, Andersen admits to herself, "I knew I would never be her mom, not in the way both of us hoped I could be. That chance, I understood now, had been lost 18 years ago." She got to learn "how to love her while simultaneously letting her go. Maybe that’s what motherhood is about after all."\nOne way of responding to Andersen’s piece is to say she’s blind to her own material. But another way is to say she knows what she’s doing and she’s counting on readers to see past the story she says she’s telling to the ghastly story she hints at. Motherhood! an attentive reader is apt to think. This story isn't about motherhood. The real story here, the one we glimpse between the cracks, is about a little girl who grew up with two mothers who both abandoned her. She probably would have been better off if she’d never known her birth mother existed. Does Andersen understand that the boilerplate sentiments about motherhood she recites to wrap up her piece are vapid and off-point? Maybe not, but I want to think she does. As a final ironic flourish to a piece of ingenious creative writing they’re hard to top. I want to think that Andersen, like Aimee Levitt, knows her stuff and trusts her readers to find what's there.
0161_8873d7bc-4af4-4493-a772-ab2b5584f4e1	Gossip by Clara Grace Walker is a bit of a one-size-fits-all novel with something for everyone - a gripping murder mystery, some raunchy sex scenes, an awww-inspiring romance and the usual glitzy A-lister adventures and misadventures often encountered in summery chicklit. The book starts with a darker side. Newshound Nick Beck chases off to a murder scene at the local golf club, hoping for an exciting new story to cover, only to discover that the victim is his wife. There is some poetic justice here but I felt some empathy for him because, while he is happy to dish the dirt on the rich and famous in his celeb-filled tabloid, he does also have a more highbrow news publication so he seems slightly less ruthless and opportunistic than his purely scandal-seeking rival, Peter Arnold. With a seedy porn studio and its lowlife employees, a string of used and abused starlets and endless acrimonious divorces and extra-marital affairs popping up in the story, there are more suspects than you could shake a stick at !  It's a fun read with an engaging storyline and characters that you either love to love or love to hate. It reminded me of the atmosphere of Desperate Housewives and was perfect for devouring by the pool in Turkey. Gossip is one book from the Desire Never Dies trilogy, but it works perfectly as a stand-alone novel. We even had fun with the front cover taking selfies ! star rating : 4/5 Paperback: 376 pages Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (20 July 2014) Language: English ISBN-10: 1499286120 ISBN-13: 978-1499286120 Product Dimensions: 15.2 x 2.2 x 22.9 cm Disclosure : I received a copy of the book in order to write an honest review.
0162_c0a70550-50a5-4054-a954-cc88538a98c6	Here is some information on a few occasional invaders you may find in and around your home. Pesticides are not necessary to control any of them. \n\nSowbugs (Porcellionidae) and Pillbugs (Armadillidiidae) \n\nSowbugs and pillbugs, which are also called roly polys and woodlice, are crustaceans, not insects. They require a lot of moisture where they live. Sowbugs (Porcellio laevis) and pillbugs (Armadillium vulgare ) are actually beneficial as they are excellent decomposers. Pillbugs can roll up into a ball when threatened. Sowbugs cannot roll up into a ball. \n \nThey aren’t major pests, but will damage bean sprouts. They can be kept away from plants by putting food grade diatomaceous earth (DE) on the ground around the base of the plants. You can keep them out of your house by installing door sweeps if your doors don’t close tightly. \n\nScale insects (Coccidae) \n\nFemale scale insects are oval in shape and usually convex, but some species are flat. They have a hard cuticle that is either smooth or covered with a wax-like material. Most scale insects feed on plants and some are serious pests of crops. They are not a major pest in home gardens, but there is one species that is very common on houseplants. The brown soft scale (Coccus hesperidum) is found in houseplants all over the world. It will feed on a variety of flowering plants and ornamental foliage but is particularly fond of ferns. \n\nBecause of their scale-like body wall, they can be difficult to treat. If you have plants that are heavily infested, it would be best to discard them. You can remove them individually from plants by swabbing them with a mixture of alcohol and water or dish soap and water. \n\nSnails (Helicidae) and Slugs (Limacidae) \n\nSnails and slugs are terrestrial mollusks. Snails have shells while slugs do not. There are a great many species, but only a few are pests in gardens. They will feed on a wide variety of plants and are most active at night or after rains. They often leave large, jagged holes in the leaves of plants they are feeding on. \n\nThe best method of control is to put DE under and around all plants you want to protect as they will not crawl over it. You can also trap them with small pans of beer in the yard. The good news is the beer will also attract and kill any cockroaches in the yard. Never use a commercial snail bait that contains methaldehyde as this is very dangerous to dogs. \n\nSpringtails (Collembola) \n\nSpringtails are very small, wingless insects. Some are brown or gray, while other are brightly colored. They have a structure (furcula) on their underside that enables them to jump when suddenly straightened out. \n \nSpringtails are probably the most abundant non-social insect on the planet. There are approximately 650 species in the United States alone and they are found in the Arctic and Antarctic. \n\nThey can be very common in damp, organic soil where they feed on fungus. Large numbers in any area will show that the soil is healthy. They rarely cause any damage to plants, but will occasionally feed on young shoots. \n\nContrary to what some people believe, springtails are not capable of infesting human beings. This is a myth that is often found on the Internet. \n\nYou can control them by mixing DE with the soil they are in. In houseplants it would be a good idea to dry the soil out to eliminate any mold or fungi that they may be feeding on. If you have them in your home, you can spray them with a mixture of soap, water and alcohol. Mix a sprayer with equal amounts of water and alcohol and add a couple of tablespoons of dish soap. \n\nIf you have any pest questions, you can contact me at askthebugman2013@gmail.com or call me at 385-2820.

0163_38d46731-a757-4441-9844-3a4fcac4b656	Harris Billings , Staff Writer • September 4, 2015 • Leave a Commen \n\n     \n\nIn 1993, Ireland decriminalized homosexual activity. Twenty-two years later, the transgender community of Ireland celebrates a major victory. \n \nIn May 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote. Two months later, Ireland made history yet again by becoming the fifth nation worldwide to legally recognize a transgender individual’s self-identified gender without medical or government intervention. \n \nIreland now joins the ranks of Denmark, Malta, Argentina and Columbia. \n \nThe term transgender refers to an individual who identifies as a gender different from their biological sex. Laverne Cox, Chaz Bono, Ruby Rose and Caitlyn Jenner are all examples of high-profile transgender individuals. \n \nIn many European countries, transgender people are required to receive sex-reassignment surgery, a diagnosis of mental disorder, a divorce if married or even sterilization before receiving legal recognition of their gender identity. \n \n“Transitioning is a complicated process,” said Assistant Professor of Psychology Sarah Estow. “Individuals choose to do so in many different ways.  There is often an overemphasis on and, sadly, a lurid curiosity about the state of a trans person’s genitals, completely missing the complexity of what it means to be trans.” \n \nMany feel setting requirements for legal recognition is harmful to how transgender people who desire to transition differently, or not at all, are treated and perceived. \n \nThis bill, however, allows individuals above the age 18 to receive this recognition without any such intervention or requirements, putting transgender individuals in control of the definition and determination of their own gender identities. \n \nCritics of this bill point out that there is currently no option other than male or female, which they feel excludes intersex and non-binary-identifying individuals, a large part of the transgender community, from legal recognition. \n \n“With any kinds of moments that appear as unmitigated wins, we have to be conscious of the message we are sending,” said Parker Hurley, LGBTQQA coordinator. “What this is saying is that it’s okay to be trans, so long as you are a certain type of trans.” \n \nGroups such as the Transgender Equality Network Ireland are currently lobbying for the inclusion of these identities. \n \nIn America, transgender individuals still face many barriers to receiving legal recognition. Most states require sex-reassignment surgery to alter one’s sex on their birth certificate, with Idaho, Kansas, Ohio and Tennessee refusing to alter these documents altogether. \n \nAdditionally, these legal processes and medical procedures are extremely costly and often inaccessible to transgender individuals. \n \n“These barriers cause a lot of issues for those who don’t have the money or don’t have the desire to physically transition but still identify as transgender,” said sophomore Aron Correa. \n \nIn America especially, transgender individuals face not only discrimination and lack of legal recognition, but also extreme cases of violence. \n \nAccording to a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, out of all of the instances of reported homicide against LGBTQ individuals in 2013, 72 percent were transgender women, 67 percent of which were transgender women of color. \n \nAdditionally, in 2014, the Williams Institute published a report stating that 42 to 46 percent of transgender individuals have attempted suicide, compared to a rate of 4.6 percent for the overall population. \n \nIreland has taken the first step in combating this violence and self-harm, and their demonstration of solidarity could go a long way. \n \n“Having an entire country support the trans community in such a large way is really helpful,” said junior and trans student activist Taylor Brown. “It gives hope to trans kids everywhere who want to go throuh the whole process of transition.” \n\n     \n\nTags: #transgender , discrimination , Ireland , rights , same-sex marriage \n\n\nLeave a Comment      \nName (required) \n\n \nEmail Address (required) \n\n \nWebsite \n\n  \nSpeak your mind
0164_ac6904b6-1d1a-49ef-8e6c-28f6744efe22	Teen's father ran for president of Sudan earlier this year \n\nBy \n\nUpdated 09/16 2015 02:51PM \n\nCopyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \n\nThe same day Texas police announced that a teenager falsely suspected of making a bomb would not be charged, President Barack Obama invited the student to the White House. \n\n"Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great," the POTUS Twitter account tweeted. \n\nAhmed Mohamed, who plans to become an engineer, went to his high school in Irving, Texas, on Monday with the goal of showing his teacher a digital clock he'd made from a pencil case. \n\nBut the 14-year-old's day did not end with high praise. Instead, an English teacher reported Ahmed's project, which prompted school officials to call police. A photo shows Ahmed being led out of school in handcuffs and a NASA T-shirt. \n\n"They arrested me and they told me that I committed the crime of a hoax bomb, a fake bomb," the freshman later explained. \n\nMohamed repeatedly told police that what they believed to be a bomb was actually a clock. He said they would not allow him to contact his father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, who ran for president of Sudan earlier this year. \n\n"My son is a very brilliant boy," the father told CNN. "We need people like him in this country." \n\nU.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan agreed. \n\n"We need to be encouraging young engineers, not putting them in handcuffs. #IStandWithAhmed," Duncan tweeted. \n\nThe White House invited Ahmed to Astronomy Night in October, an annual event that brings together astronauts, scientists and other professionals. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the incident "is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even goodhearted people who have dedicated their lives to educating young people from doing the good work they set out to do. \n\n"The president, like many of us, was struck by the news reports of this particular incident. The fact is, America's best teachers and our schools and our best schools, at least, nurture the intellectual curiously of all of our students. And this instance, it's clear that at least some of Ahmed's teachers failed him," Earnest said. \n\nPolice announced Wednesday that the teen will not be charged, but Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed said he is not sure if his son will return to school Thursday. School officials said they were cooperating with authorities on the matter. \n\n"We always ask our students and staff to immediately report if they observe any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior," the school's statement reads. "If something is out of the ordinary, the information should be reported immediately to a school administrator and/or the police so it can be addressed right away. We will always take necessary precautions to protect our students and keep our school community as safe as possible." \n\nIn the meantime, Ahmed was racking up invitations from top tech companies. Google invited him on Twitter to this weekend's Google Science Fair. \n\nAnd Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg invited the teen to stop by his company in a statement posted on his page. \n\n"Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest. The future belongs to people like Ahmed. \n\n"Ahmed, if you ever want to come by Facebook, I'd love to meet you. Keep building," Zuckerberg wrote.

0166_555c7cb1-b2b5-45c5-a729-de91603153b0	Lock your car. Take your keys. These are the words taught to us as we were learning to drive and be responsible car owners. Of course it should go without saying to never drink and drive. But that is a subject that I will leave to others better equipped to delve into that arena. The lock your car and take your keys arena is where I want to drive your attention today. \n\nOf course I lock my car. I would be devastated if someone got into my car and took my four dollars and seventeen cents worth of loose change I throw in the console between the two front seats in case I have a need to get a soda at the nearest drive through. I call that change my Pepsi money. Even though I like Coke-a-Cola, it just sounds better to say Pepsi money than Coke money! And it would be a loss for sure if that same bad guy took my back up roll of fruit flavored life savers that I have had since Regan was in office—the governor’s office. \n\nOkay so I don’t have a ton of valuables in my car. But I also don’t want my car to be driven off to some greasy chop shop and be cut apart and sold by Marlon Brando wannabes ready to offer you a deal you can’t refuse! So I lock my car to keep her and her cargo safe from sticky fingers. \n\nBut that second set of words. Take your keys. Now-a-days I seem to have a problem, and apparently I am not alone. If you are new to me, you should know that I own a devil car. Yes the little devil is way smarter than yours truly. I take no pride in that fact, but I am a realist and know my limitations. \n\nThat knowing your limitations thing is one very important life lesson to learn. I remember finally realizing it when I was asked to climb a very step muddy hill on a Honda 110. Suffice to say I now know I have limitations and I use that life knowledge nearly every day! But again I have slipped off the trail… \n\nSo just how smart is my car? Well it doesn’t need keys. Nope, some rocket scientist, okay a car scientist, at a car manufacturing plant in some far east country, (hint, hint) decided to create a car that can tell if you have your key fob thingy on your person or in your purse, and without a real key looking type of key you can lock, unlock, start and turn off your car by pushing various buttons. Well I had to have that! It was so cool when the salesman was going over all the do dahs of the car when we bought it. Oh we bought it all right, we bought it all. Silly us! \n \nSkip forward a year… I now carry the key thingy in my pocket, luckily I wear jeans everywhere. I parked at a Costco to do some light shopping. Wait, light shopping and Costco? Again, silly me. Anyway I parked and my other half and I got out of the car. To lock our devil car you just need to push a little square black spot on one of the front door handles and the car politely say, “Beep,” from somewhere around its rear end. (Well that sounds unladylike.) \n\nSo I touched the magic spot and my devil car said, “Beep, beep, beep.” Wait? What? Three beeps. Well I thought I was hearing things. So as any woman would, I touched the magic spot again. Beep, beep, beep. Okay now I’m getting hot and I want to get to the muffins in Costco before they run out. I touched it again, of course. Beep, beep, beep. All this time the husband is just waiting, looking at me as though I were crazy. I am not! He of course can’t hear the beeping anyway. \n\nMust be door ajar. I go around and open, close and check each door. Didn’t seem any were askew. So of course I touched the magic spot again. Beep, beep, beep. Well what the? \n\nThe key fob thingy is in my pocket, yes I checked. So I went back to the beginning. I opened the driver’s door and got in. I closed the door and took a deep breath and noticed the air conditioner was cooling me. Nice. And the radio was on. Tuned to the 60’s. Wait the tachometer was registering like 1500—well that could only mean---yes the car was still running. Note to self, devil car will not lock if engine is still running. Engine running, air blowing, radio playing, and owner--stupid!

0168_8749cce6-fbc8-47a1-b30b-519b9a9d4d7e	Australia's South Sudanese community is turning out promising teenage basketball stars, with dozens of young men winning competitive sporting scholarships in the United States. \n\nA little-known basketball club in western Sydney is one the clubs which has been a training ground for players who are being noticed by American scouts. \n\nThe Savannah Pride in Blacktown has teams made up of all South-Sudanese-Australian players. \n\nHead coach Mayor Chagai said between 10 and 15 teenagers from Australia's South Sudanese community were going to the United States every year, to take up sporting scholarships in schools and colleges. \n\n"It's a big opportunity," Mr Chagai said.. \n\n"It gives them better education, better basketball, and a chance of a lifetime career." \n\nHe said Australian teenagers were playing in Kentucky, Florida and Texas. \n  \nOne of Savannah Pride's latest teenage stars, Deng Gak, has just left for the United States, after he won a scholarship at the prestigious Blair Academy in New Jersey. \n\nAt a statuesque 207 centimetres, that's 6 foot 10 inches, 17-year-old Mr Gak has caught the eye of scouts. \n\n"They want me to be like part of their basketball program and finish my next two years of school there," he said. \n   \nThere's a lot of opportunities for them in Australia compared to South Sudan where we all came from. \n \n      Head coach Mayor Chagai   \n"It's obviously what I want to do and you have to kind of be willing to do things that other people don't want to do, lots of early morning training. \n\n"I come back here and play [in Blacktown] all the time. I love the atmosphere that this place brings, that South Sudanese people bring to basketball." \n\nSavannah Pride was formed almost a decade ago by 30-year-old South Sudanese refugee Mayor Chagai after he arrived in Australia from war-torn Sudan. \n\n"What it is about is the love for the game, it is also the other aspect of it is the social part of it and education," he said. \n\n"It's not just only about basketball. It's also engagement and social inclusion for these young kids and the fun of playing basketball." \n\nHe said most of the boys are children of parents who fled Sudan before South Sudan officially gained independence in 2011. \n\n"Most of their parents fled south and they settled here in Australia or some kids come here with their uncles, aunties and the mother or the father they all remain in South Sudan and that's always a challenge as well because they miss their family," Mr Chagai said. \n  \nMr Gak said teenagers from the South Sudanese community are attracted to basketball because they have "natural skills". \n\n"We're long and tall. We can run pretty fast, jump pretty high so I think we've like found out that we're pretty good at it and everyone likes it." \n\nWhile Savannah Pride was one of the first teams of its kind, teams are now starting up across Australia. \n\nThe National South Sudanese Australian Basketball Association now has 1,000 teenagers involved. \n\nMr Chagai said he was incredibly proud of his protégés. \n\n"They're having a lot of opportunities here. There's a lot of opportunities for them in Australia compared to South Sudan where we all came from," he said. \n\n"It wouldn't be the same if these kids were in South Sudan or any part of Africa compared to the opportunities that they are having right now in the community, playing basketball, having an education which is one of the biggest opportunities. \n\n"So their dreams now are more positive."

While such CMA categories as vocal duo, video and musical event have often featured non-hit artists and material, the entertainer, album and male and female vocalist categories are all populated with at least one artist who hasn't had a top 10 single during the eligibility period, including Kacey Musgraves , Chris Stapleton ,  Garth Brooks and Lee Ann Womack . Granted, three of those acts reached No. 1 or No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart, and all have had hits as an artist or songwriter in the past. Still, it suggests CMA voters are taking the time to look beyond radio playlists to judge what's working, creatively and/or financially, in the format. \n \nChris Stapleton Travels Back Up the Charts; Thomas Rhett Scores Again at Country Radio \n \nDierks Bentley is expanding his Whiskey Row restaurant and bar : A new franchise opens Sept. 17 in Tempe, Ariz., less than 7 miles from the first Row locale in Scottsdale.

The association comes as he prepares for his first headlining tour, an 11-date club romp that begins Nov. 6 at Coyote Joe's in Charlotte, N.C., and wraps Dec. 11 at the Revolution Music Room in Little Rock, Ark. \n \n'ROUND THE ROW \n \nSony Music Nashville made a pair of promotion staff changes, effective Sept. 14.

0172_fd8d5661-f6f5-48a9-975f-8243b6e1ffd2	10:50 am Washington: Reflecting their dramatically expanded political, economic and strategic cooperation, India and the US have announced a new Diplomacy Partnership aimed at more closely aligning their strategic perspectives, diplomatic training, and engagements around the world.\n\nThe new partnership was announced at the conclusion of the first US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue co-chaired by Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and US Secretary of State John Kerry. The Diplomacy Partnership between the US State Department of and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs includes a new Policy Planning Dialogue to share perspectives on strategic challenges and opportunities. The Diplomacy Partnership also will familiarise the two sides’ diplomatic corps with each other through site visits by institute staff and diplomats, and by the exchange of best practices in diplomatic training. As part of the Diplomacy Partnership, the US and India will strengthen and expand their consultations on the full range of regional and functional diplomatic issues. A fact sheet issued after the dialogue also noted that ten years ago, defence trade between the US and India was virtually non-existent.\n\nOver the last few years, the US has signed more than $10 billion in defence sales to India. These capabilities have strengthened India’s role as a net provider of security in the Indian Ocean Region, it said. US and Indian businesses have partnered on the co-development of defence equipment, establishing a base from which to launch new Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) co-development and co-production efforts in the future and expand the Indian defence industrial base.\n\nA renewed 10-year Defence Framework signed in June 2015 provides avenues for high level strategic discussions, continued exchanges between armed forces of both countries, and strengthening capabilities. The fact sheet noted that to-way trade has increased nearly three-fold from $36 billion in 2005 to $104 billion in 2014. Similarly, US investments in India have increased from a total FDI stock of $7.7 billion in 2004 to $28 billion today. Travel for tourism, business, and education has seen unprecedented growth: a 152 percent increase in overall visa applications for Indians wishing to travel to the US, reaching a total of over one million applications in FY 2015.\n\nVisa applications for Indian students have increased by 202 percent to 92,156 in FY 2015. US visitors to India have nearly doubled from 611,165 visitors in 2005 to 1,123,444 in 2015. Indian students account for the second-largest group of foreign students in the US, with approximately 102,673 students studying in the US in 2013-14. At the same time, more than a million Americans travelled to India in 2013, and more than 4,000 Indians applied for student visas at US diplomatic facilities in India on a single day in May 2015.\n\nThe Indian diaspora, the fact sheet noted, has made enormous contributions to every facet of American society. It has contributed “its talents and ingenuity at the tech start-ups of Silicon Valley, the lecture halls and labs of premier educational institutions, the board rooms of Fortune 500 companies, and the corridors of Washington and across the nation.”\n\nShare this Post: « Previous Article
0173_041822fe-6f2c-4502-bc29-1186f5ffc5eb	Max Wolter and Terry Peterson with a 23-inch Hayward area walleye (Photo: Courtesy of ) \n\nAnd here comes fall...  This week has been a treat.  I took a couple of days off and spent some time on the water with my good buddy Terry Peterson, and we started out on Tuesday by returning a favor.  Wisconsin DNR Fisheries Biologist Max Wolter was kind enough to take Terry and I out this past spring to help check nets as they did their annual population surveys on the Hayward, WI area lakes.  It was about time he got to see the fruits of his labor!  We spent the morning focusing on walleyes and found some fish up to 23" in 30' - 35' of water on jigs and minnows.  It wasn't a fast bite by any means, but we were able to locate some willing fish.  In the afternoon we turned our attention to smallmouth and found plenty of nice fish up to 18" on rocks in 14' - 18' of water using minnows and drop shotting plastics.  Water temperatures held around 72 degrees on a warm day with bright skies.  With Terry (The Professor) and a local fisheries biologist in the boat those fish had no idea what hit them...  They didn't stand a chance!!!  Thanks for all of your hard work on our lakes Max.  You're doing a fantastic job, and your efforts are appreciated by all of us who use and depend on these lakes. \n\nTerry and I were back in the boat on Thursday with Terry's long time customer and friend Orville Landry from Hinsdale, IL.  Orville has been fishing with Terry for over 20 years and it was a really neat opportunity to fish with another guide and one of his long time customers.  We chased crappies all day and found them scattered in small schools over 21' - 25' of water.  They weren't bunched up like they've been in previous days, and I suspect the cold front with north winds we had coming in had something to do with it.  We'd catch a few fish up to 12" out of every school on plastics but had to move frequently to stay on biters.  I also noticed that some fish were relating to the thermocline, and others were relating to deep basins.  It was a good example on how to stay on top of fish at this time of year, and I couldn't have had two more capable guys in my boat.  Water temps held around 70 degrees on a cool day with high skies and north winds.  Thanks for the great day and all of the great laughs guys.  I had a blast! \n\nI was back to work on Friday and Fall arrived with stiff north winds and air temps in the 50's.  Hard to believe we were steaming hot just 5 days ago...  Good friend and customer Jon Schlussler from St. Paul, MN returned and brought buddy Greg Kennedy from Sillwater, MN to chase smallies on Chequamegon Bay.  We started out hot boating a couple of nice fish including Jon's fat 21" bruiser, but things got funky in a hurry.  North winds picked up to over 20 mph, and we had a hard time staying on fish.  Time to move...  We went inland for the afternoon, and it proved to be a good decision.  We were immediately on a hot bite landing lots of good fish up to 20" on minnows in 13' - 18' of water.  It was pure chaos at times with both guys battling fish after fish.  We even connected on a couple of double opportunities that included a late day rally with a bonus walleye.  Water temps inland were around 69 degrees, but I expect that to plummet over the next few days with cold nights in the forecast.  It's always a blast to have Jon in the boat, and Greg was a welcome addition.  Good thing I pointed out schlussler8those feeding fish at the end of the day to you Jon...  What would you do with out me?  See you in a couple of weeks my friend!!! \n\nFourteen years ago the world stopped turning on this day.  In some ways it feels like yesterday and in others it was a lifetime ago.  One thing is for sure, it's not forgotten!!!  To all of our firemen, police officers, and first responders...  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!  To all of the families of the victims...  You're always in our thoughts.  God Bless America!!! \n\nFor more from Jeff, including more fishing reports, go to jeffevansfishing.com \n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1URrYHH

See them worn on the blog before in the Wide-leg Pants Under $15 post.\nTee—Gap Cardigan—Loft (old) | similar Pants—Forever 21 | similar\nSandals—J.Crew Bag—Rebecca Minkoff Necklace—Lisa Freede Ring—St. John Watch—Movado | Skagen option Lip—Mac Vamplify "Peer Pressure", Mac "Vino" lip pencil\nBlush—NYX "Intuition"\nNails—OPI "stay in the night"\nI certainly plan to wear these linen pants for as long as the weather permits, especially since they're so easy to style for fall. For today's look, I added fall layers in grey and burgundy, a couple of my favorite autumnal hues.  It's not too cold for sandals just yet, so my J.Crew buckled mid-heel sandals got a run in this look. On a much cooler fall day, I would likely reach for a chic loafer or a pointed-toe flat. My grey cardigan (Banana Republic option) has been such a useful piece in my wardrobe. I got this particular style at Loft about five years ago, and it's still in perfect condition. I've worn it so much too. Remember this navy and grey ensemble? That's one of my favorite color combinations. I've also worn it with dresses. Remember how the cardigan helped ready this shift dress for fall? Today's images were taken at one of my favorite living green walls in my neighborhood. I wanted to photograph the wall before the leaves start changing color and eventually fall off. Want to see how it'll look later? Check out these two posts from last fall shot at the same location: Sweatshirt Style and Sweater Style. I've been shopping for a new tote for about a month. I knew I wanted a bag in a burgundy or wine color because that color goes with everything and always looks quite luxe in leather. After browsing several options, I narrowed the choices down to the Madewell Transport tote and the Rebecca Minkoff Unlined tote because of their classic, simple, and chic designs. I loved the more low-key look of the Madewell tote, but it was just too large for me. By the way, I got the Rebecca Minkoff bag at 15% off by signing up for emails at the Rebecca Minkoff site, a pop-up offer that's always available.   Shop the look:
0175_0968846d-7a55-4908-b897-48d1208fa396	NEW YORK — Bernie Sanders brought a “Feel the Bern” coffee cup for Stephen Colbert along with his message of lifting the middle class, and in return received a rock star’s welcome from the studio audience as a guest on CBS’ “The Late how” Frida. \n\n\n\t\tThe Vermont senator and Democratic presidential hopeful also brought along statistics to support his cause. \n\n\n\t\t“It is a moral outrage that the top one-tenth of 1 percent today owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent; that 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent,” he sid. \n \n\n\t\tTo that, as with nearly everything he said, the audience cheered. \n\n \n\n\n\t\tBut Colbert asked him how he expected to go all the way to the White House without forming a Super PAC and soliciting campaign contributions from big donors. \n\n\n\t\t“You don’t bring a spoon to a knife fight,” Colbertsaid. \n\n\n\t\tSanders countered he was getting small donations from hundreds of thousands of individual contributors instead. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\t\tSanders laughed. \n\n\n\t\t“I prefer the term ‘progressive,”’ he declared.
0176_10db0fad-9eb1-4255-9a5a-f709a102c60c	On a night when newcomers made their presence known for a short-handed Lincoln Southwest volleyball team, experienced seniors stepped forward when the Silver Hawks needed it most. \n\nSenior Maddie Kelle had four kills in the fifth set and senior outside hitter Brenna Hansen registered a key ace block and served an ace on back-to-back points to lift the Class A No. 6 Hawks to a 25-16, 21-25, 26-24, 12-25, 15-13 home triumph over No. 9 Lincoln North Star in the season opener for both teams Thursday night. \n\nAfter North Star battled from an 8-3 deficit to take a 13-12 lead, Hansen’s block tied the fifth set at 13, then her ace serve put Southwest at match point. After a long rally, senior setter Hailey Bax ended it with a dump shot that the Navigators couldn’t cover. \n\nBax had six of her 18 assists in the final set. \n\nThe victory becomes even more significant considering Southwest was without its two senior all-state players, both of whom are Division I college recruits. Allie Davis, a 6-foot-2 Wichita State outside hitter recruit, is still a couple of weeks away from returning to the lineup after two offseason wrist surgeries. \n\nSenior libero and Northern Colorado recruit Taylor Els is out for two weeks because of disciplinary reasons. \n\n“This win shows what kind of program we have,” said Hansen, a 5-10 outside hitter who led a balanced Southwest attack with 10 kills, two ace blocks and three ace serves. \n\nTwo freshmen played key roles for Southwest — 5-10 outside hitter Jaden Ferguson who finished with 10 kills and three blocks, and 6-foot Hannah Kelle, Maddie’s younger sister. Sophomore libero Kaitlin Siefkes had 28 digs in place of Els. Setter/right side Rachel Walker, a sophomore transfer from Auburn, had 23 assists and seven kills in her first Class A match. \n \n“It was fun to see all the new players come out and kill it like they did,” said Maddie Kelle, who had 10 kills and three ace blocks. “I know they were all nervous before the match, but once they got out there and settled in, they did great.” \n\nNorth Star dominated the fourth set, then battled back from the early five-point deficit in the fifth to take its 13-12 advantage on a Southwest hitting error. \n\nSuper-State senior middle blocker Sarah Allick paced the Navigators with a match-high 14 kills and three ace blocks. Ashley Kistaitis added 10 kills, while Jenna Tederman and Haley Seip added eight kills each.
0177_c4ef356f-c8fe-49e9-bd48-82242914d009	Share This Tags Business News of Tuesday, 15 September 2015 Source: Graphic.com.gh 2015-09-15 File photo The Programme Leader of GhanaVeg, Mr Joep van den Broek, has said the country could become self-sufficient in vegetable production when the public works with the private sector as stakeholders for a year-round irrigated production. He said it would be a win-win for both sides when the public sector developed infrastructure and attracted the private sector to come in with other logistics and infrastructure within the value chain. “Ultimately, a lot of opportunities for Ghana lie in irrigated production throughout the country, from the south, the middle belt and the north. The country is nestled around water bodies but with very little irrigation. With irrigation, you can do off-season production and meet local demand and stop the importation of onions, tomatoes and other vegetables. Speaking to the Daily Graphic at the 9th GhanaVeg Business Platform in Accra, the programme leader said the country had a perfect climate for the production of vegetables such as onions, chillies and tomatoes, and that coupled with the abundance of water, the country had all going for it to become a major player in the production of vegetables. A Dutch trade mission, comprising leading vegetable sector companies, was in the country to explore market and investment opportunities. GhanaVeg, which created the platform to bring players in the industry together to touch base on trends and developments, is a four-year strategic response (2014-2017) by the Netherlands to develop a sustainable and internationally competitive vegetable sector in the country to contribute to inclusive economic growth. It is a bilateral support by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands committed to developing and promoting commercial vegetables sector in the country. Selecting a sector to support was research-based which proved the country’s vast potential. There are enormous market opportunities across the world for vegetables, with the Netherlands alone holding about 14 billion euros in value. In 2013 for instance, it imported 4.6 billion euros worth of fresh fruits and vegetables from 107 countries and exported 7.1 billion to 150 countries. Ghana, where the need to consume more vegetable is catching on with the population imports various vegetables from the Netherlands and neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali and La Cote d’Ivoire. Mr Broek cited VegPro as a good example of how the government, under the Millennium Challenge Account grant, developed an irrigation project at Kpong at the Left Bank of Akuse Kpong Piped Irrigation Water Supply (KPIWS) Project for VegPro Ghana Limited. A member of the trade mission, Bejo Seeds, visited a carrot farm at Mampong which produces 10 tons. But the seeds company representatives believed that with their intervention and further linkages with other solutions providers in the Netherlands, the company should be able to easily scale up yields to 40 tons. The companies in the mission also included Unitherm, a cold chain provider; mechanisation equipment providers, Kramer and Matrex, and was led by Mr Peter Verbaas, the director of the Dutch fruit and vegetables wholesale association, FrugiVenta. GhanaVeg also presented findings on its private extension service study, which examined the three options of working with input suppliers to provide extension support to farmers. These involved forming study clubs of farmers who share experience, knowledge and ideas and solve common challenges together, and a third option of using more consultancy services delivered by experts with vegetables as their specialisation. “We see great prospects in the third option. There are already a number of good agricultural consultancy companies in Ghana who are active in all kinds of sectors, including fruits and vegetables. What we would like to do with them is to see how they can expand their scope to training small scale farmers, groups of farmers and outgrower schemes with the latest state-of-the-art knowledge in vegetable production,” Mr Broek explained. Working with smallholder farmers is a major requirement within GhanaVeg’s mandate, which is aimed at encouraging inclusive development.

0179_d5871f4a-a7a3-4c6c-99e2-7fc59484cde7	In May, the discovery of a young woman’s body packed into a suitcase buried under cement in the hills in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, left South Korea in shock and horror. \n \nThe 26-year-old, surnamed Kim, was murdered by her 24-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly killed her while drunk after she tried to break up with him. The boyfriend, only identified by his surname Lee, impersonated Kim on social media for two weeks after killing her and disposing of her body. \n \nAccording to Rep. Jeong Yong-ki of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of murder cases among dating partners has been on the rise in Korea since 2012, from 99 to 108 last year. In the last three years, the number of victims like Kim totaled 313. \n \n       A research also showed that 40 percent of the Korean women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. (123RF)     \nThe murder cases accounted for 11.9 percent of all crimes committed by the victims’ romantic partners against them, including stalking, physical violence and rape. The rate is particularly high considering the total number of murder cases in Korea only accounted for 1.69 percent of all violent crimes — murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — in the same period. \n \n“This means two people are being killed by their romantic partners every week,” Rep. Jeong said. \n \nAccording to Korea Women’s Hotline, a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence, at least 114 Korean women were killed by either their husbands or boyfriends last year, while at least 95 women survived after being seriously attacked by their spouses or romantic partners. \n \nAlmost 90 percent of women who participated in the NGO’s research last year said they had been either physically or emotionally abused while dating or during courtship. From 2011 to 2013, some 20,500 individuals were arrested for dating violence. \n \nAccording to the police, Kim had also reportedly endured serious dating violence for about a year until she tried to end things with Lee. \n \nAccording to local news reports, Lee would often break into Kim’s house without consent for “not picking up his calls” and physically abuse her. Lee later confessed to the police that he killed Kim “in a fit of rage” when he learned that Kim wanted to break up with him. \n \nKim and Lee had met as teacher and student at a private English institution in Busan, where Kim had been teaching upon returning to Korea after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany. \n \nKim’s story overlaps with experiences of many women who participated in researcher Lee Hwa-young’s study for Korea Women’s Hotline. \n \nMany suffered abuse, assault and rape when they tried to end the relationship. \n \nOne of the victims had been dragged to a motel room against her will and raped there by her enraged boyfriend, right after she told him that she wanted to break up with him. \n \nAnother victim had been guilt-tripped and emotionally abused after she tried to end things with her boyfriend. “He told me that I’m being a terrible person (by trying to break up with him) to his mother as well, because he already told her that we are getting married and our breakup is going to hurt and disappoint her badly,” the victim told researcher Lee in her study. \n \nAnother victim was stunned by what a police officer told her after she reported her ex. She also had been stalked and physically abused by her ex after breaking up with him. The officer reportedly told her: “You shouldn’t have been so harsh when you broke up with him.” \n \nAccording to Safe Harbors of the Finger Lakes, an American support organization for victims of violence, there are some characteristics that are common to abusers of dating violence. One of them has to do with gender role expectations. \n \nMany individuals who abuse their romantic partners tend to have certain ideas of how men and women should act, largely following the stereotypical ideas of male dominance and female passivity. \n \nThe abusers also may have difficulty expressing feelings, abuse alcohol and be “protective of their romantic partners to the point of controlling that person,” according to the organization. \n \nLocal experts say that popular culture and sex education are some of the biggest — and often negative — influences in gender role expectations among Koreans, which sometimes cause problematic consequences in relationships. \n \n“For example, there are so many Korean TV dramas that show its male protagonist forcing a kiss onto his love interest, while the woman just docilely accepts it,” researcher Lee from Korea Women’s Hotline told The Korea Herald. \n \n“Many men, especially teenagers, may think this is normal and acceptable behavior. It does not only apply to men. While men may think it’s acceptable to kiss or touch someone against the person’s will — or it’s not ‘manly enough’ or ‘cool’ to even ask the woman for consent — young women may think they should just remain silent even if their dating partner does something they don’t want or like, or keep their wants to themselves and wait until the man makes the move.” \n \nMeanwhile, the Education Ministry’s recently issued – and heavily criticized – guidelines for sex education famously stated that “date rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want commensurate compensation from the woman.” \n \nLee’s research also showed that 40 percent of the women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. The largest portion of them, 60 percent, said it was because the abuse was not “serious enough” to end the relationship. \n \nRep. Jeong said the government needs to be more involved in combating dating and domestic violence. Introducing heavier penalties for stalking, which often leads to more serious forms of abuse, can be one of the ways to improve the situation, according to civic experts. In Korea, the heaviest penalty a stalker can face is a fine of 100,000 won ($83). \n \nSince 2012, two bills have been proposed to introduce heavier punishment for stalking, but are still pending at the National Assembly for approval. \n \nBy Claire Lee ( dyc@heraldcorp.com )
0180_ca7c42c6-f3b4-4fa7-8770-cc5858ff39ba	She's Not There by P.J. Parrish; Thomas & Mercer (382 pages, $15.95) \n\n--- \n\nIdentity issues are among the driving force of the mystery genre as characters grapple with who they are and how events shape their persona. In P.J. Parrish's captivating "She's Not There," a young woman wrestles not only with her identity - in this case exacerbated by temporary amnesia - but also tries to find the very essence of who she is. "She's Not There" also works as a story about a marriage. \n\nAmelia wakes up in a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., hospital with no idea who she is or how she became battered and bruised. A stranger apparently found her by the side of the road and brought her to the hospital, her purse and keys missing. Slowly, her first name comes back to her as does her last name, Tobias, and the police track down her husband, Alex, who had not seen his wife in four days. But Alex's visit at the hospital leaves Amelia with an uneasy feeling so she flees the hospital. She is afraid of Alex, yet not sure why. \n\nThe worried Alex hires Clay Buchanan, a skip tracer who commands a high fee. "I do one thing and one thing only. I find people who don't want to be found." But Clay makes it clear that if Amelia has reason to be afraid, he will not tell Alex where she is. Clay's investigation takes him across the country and back to Fort Lauderdale. As Amelia slowly regains her memory, she can only rely on her instincts, which may be flawed. \n\nParrish, the pseudonym of sisters Kelly Nichols of Michigan and Kristy Montee of Fort Lauderdale, delivers a tension-filled plot rich in characterizations. Twists and turns keep the reader off-kilter. Bits and pieces of Amelia's background, and how she ended up in the hospital, are doled out, adding to the suspense, as do the snippets revealed about Clay. \n\nA sequel is required.
0181_30b981c4-8e8d-4468-b240-710f0ad82dac	07:49 PM September 9th, 2015 \n\nRecommended \n\n“It has been more than a decade and while he and everyone else have moved on, I am still standing here—alone, waiting.” \n\nThis month, fourteen years ago. \n\nIt was when he and I officially ended. It will take me a year and many more months before I can stop denying that truth to myself. But it was over then, nonetheless. Unlike the many breakups we had, that very last time, he didn’t go after me, didn’t ask me back, didn’t try to win me over. \n\nThat heartbreak led me to leave our hometown, my family, my comfort zone, and everything and everyone I knew and grew up with and start somewhere anew. It was difficult, scary and painful. Many times did I want to just pack my bags and go back home but didn’t. \n\nI still wonder how I could have stayed away for so long. But I was determined to do it not only because I needed to save face, but also because I knew I couldn’t be in the same vicinity and not pine for him. \n\nOnly God knows how many times I have driven by his house or plans I orchestrated to make sure I’d bump into or get a glimpse of him, or even how I slept with the phone right beside me to make sure I won’t ever miss a ring, a beep, a call, hoping it is him. \n\nLater I learned there was someone else. Unlike what he told me, the girl my friends had been seeing him with was not his sister. She was the girl he was about to marry two years later, have kids and build a happy home with. \n\nMany years after that day in July that sealed our fate, I managed to live my life far away and went on to have a great career, relationships, even marriage—in spite of the “closure” talk I felt I needed and never got. He too got promoted and became his company’s big boss. I moved on because I needed it to function. He moved on too—and in a big way. \n\nHis wife’s work eventually made him move overseas, while circumstances led me back home after a decade. As I write this, I’m at the airport waiting for my flight and thinking about him and me and the nonexistent us. \n\nI heard he was flying in with his wife and kids to our hometown for a vacation. By sheer coincidence, I was flying out the same day, today, for work and vacation too. It had been days since I knew and I couldn’t keep still since. I have been preoccupied with thoughts of his return—at work, while driving, when I wake up, and before I retire at night. Like my crying bouts 14 years ago, this happens anywhere and everywhere. \n\nFunny how fate works, him flying in the same day I am flying out. I wonder if it is the universe setting us up to coincidentally bump into each other or conspiring to keep us apart—like it has done in the past 14 years. \n\nGod knows I don’t know what I’ll do when I see him. With him, I don’t trust myself enough to do what is right. \n\nIt has been more than a decade and while he and everyone else have moved on, I am still standing here. Alone. Waiting, still waiting, for I don’t know what. A closure talk, perhaps? A proper ending to our love story? \n\nBelieve me, I’m a sensible girl. If a friend is in a same predicament as I am and has asked for my advice, I will say, leave, let it be. Don’t wait for a closure that may never happen and just believe that things end for a reason. \n\nBut like a doctor who can’t heal his own wounds, I can’t too. I’m messed up, like I was 14 years ago. Better now, maybe, but still messed up. \n\nNo matter how impossible it may seem, I still pray for that day to come—that he’ll help me close this chapter of my life, the way he has done with his. At the very least, please, please, let me have that. \n\nElle Miller, 33, is back at her hometown down south and dabbles in a career as a wordsmith. \n\nPREVIOUS ENTRIES \n\nLove.Life. is an online weekly column of contributed personal essays sharing real-life stories about love, relationships, sex, and yes, tadhana.

Next time they ask to borrow a cup of sugar, let's make sure they don't post about it on Facebook.\n\nBecause Facebook is precisely what got this young Ohio couple in trouble.\n\nThis story starts Aug. 24 when John Mogan, 28, and Ashley Duboe, 24, allegedly robbed Savings Bank in Ashville, a town 20 miles south of Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWebsite The Smoking Gun reports the male half of the power duo covered his face tattoos when he walked into the bank with a note and demanded cash. He is, notably, a convicted felon who was recently released after serving five years for bank robbery, according to Smoking Gun.\n\nAfter successfully fleeing with a bag of cash, Mogan and Duboe got their selfie on, police say, posting numerous photos of themselves displaying wads of cash.\n\nIn one, Mogan has a big stack of bills stuffed in his mouth and he says it's a 'McStack.'\n\nHe also does the classic athlete pose and uses a stack of bills as a phone. Hopefully, he was calling his parole officer.\n\nEventually, law enforcement was apprised of the situation, and Mogan and Duboe were arrested.

0183_4bbbcd17-6203-43fa-96a5-f43dad18c888	LOUISVILLE, Ky.: A Kentucky clerk who went to jail for defying a federal court’s orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses says she met briefly with the pope during his historic visit to the United States. \n\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, didn’t deny the encounter took place but said Wednesday in Rome that he had no comment on the topic. \n\nRowan County clerk Kim Davis and her husband met privately with Pope Francis on Thursday afternoon at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., for less than 15 minutes, said her lawyer, Mat Staver. \n\n“It was really very humbling to even think that he would want to meet me or know me,” Davis said in an interview with ABC. \n\nDavis, an Apostolic Christian, spent five days in jail earlier this month for defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In a telephone interview late Tuesday, Staver would not say who initiated the meeting with the pope or how it came to be, though he did say that Vatican officials had inquired about Davis’ situation while she was in jail. He declined to name them. \n\n“He told me before he left, he said ‘stay strong.’ That was a great encouragement,” Davis said of the pope during the ABC interview. “Just knowing that the pope is on track with what we’re doing and agreeing, you know, it kind of validates everything.” \n\nShe didn’t say in the interview whether she had a private audience with the pope or she was part of larger crowd. \n\nDavis was in Washington for the Values Voter Summit, where the Family Research Council, which opposes same-sex marriage, presented her with an award for defying the federal judge. While in Washington, the longtime Democrat said she was switching to the Republican party because she felt abandoned by Democrats in her fight against same-sex marriage. \n\nPope Francis did not focus on the divisive debate over same-sex marriage during his visit last week. As he left the country, he told reporters who inquired that he did not know Davis’ case in detail, but he defended conscientious objection as a human right. \n\n“It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right,” Francis said.

She apparently head butted one of the cops — and the whole thing was caught on tape!  \nMiko Grimes , got herself into some major trouble prior to her NFL hubby’s football game! The wife of Miami Dolphins cornerback Brent Grimes  was arrested after being given several warnings from police outside of the Dolphins stadium on Sept. 27. Following her arrest, Miko is facing charges of disorderly conduct, battery on a police officer and resisting arrest with violence. Watch the intense video of her arrest below! \n \nDuring pre-game festivities, Miko was trying to cross a busy road and refused to listen to a cop’s demand to stop, which resulted in her arrest. Although she was the one not cooperating, Miko charged at an officer who then grabbed her in a bear-hug-like motion and brought her to the ground. \n \nAfter the officer contained Miko with her hands cuffed behind her back, she still continued to be aggressive towards the cops. A huge crowd formed around Miko as she screamed profanities at the officers, repeating the phrase, “Are you f*****g serious right now?” One of the observers caught part of the incident on tape! \n \n[embedded content] \n \nMiko must have really been upset, because she didn’t stop being combative toward officers. Before being taken to an off-site police station, Miko reportedly head-butted an officer — that certainly couldn’t have helped her situation! Her aggressiveness even resulted in minor injuries to her right knee and arm. \n \nTo make matters worse, Brent apparently didn’t know about Miko’s arrest until after the game, according to reports. Unfortunately, on top of her arrest, the Dolphins suffered a major loss to the Buffalo Bills by a score of 41-14. Hearing that his wife was arrested right after a tough loss couldn’t have made things any easier for Brent or Miko! Hopefully Miko will be able to let go of her anger and resolve things with the police soon! \n  \n— Taylor Weatherby 
0186_691f4346-84bb-4dfa-80a1-3267c546a1ca	When the train's map lit up showing it had crossed into Germany, an Iraqi refugee couple felt a rush of peace and joy. \n \nThey and their baby had survived a hellish journey through the Balkans. At last their dream of a "beautiful life" far from bombs seemed within reach. \n \nCradling four-month-old Adam, Ahmad and Alia from Baghdad could now relax in the plush evening train from Vienna , among businessmen, tourists and other refugees, amazed at their week-long odyssey from Turkey to Greece , then Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Austria. \n \nThe nightmare, they hoped, was behind them, an exhausting 2,500-kilometre (1,500-mile) journey, with an AFP team travelling along from the Greek-Macedonian border up to Germany, which many refugees see as a promised land. \n \n"We made it," smiled 27-year-old Ahmad, who sold his home and fashion store to take his wife and son out of harm's way. \n \nIn the past week, the hip young couple with Adam tucked in a baby sling had escaped arrest by border authorities, slept rough when no hotels would take them in, evaded thieves and haggled with greedy smugglers. \n \nIn the Balkan countries they had entered legally, they waited long hours under the scorching sun, then shivering at night, to register with local authorities. They were given practically no assistance amid a shocking dearth of government and international aid along the way. \n \nWith the AFP photo, text and video team in tow, the couple plodded north by train, bus, on foot, an exodus marred at every turn with the sense they were being exploited. \n \nIn and out of Hungary, they held their breath as they followed an Iraqi Kurdish smuggler through fields under the moonlight to avoid being fingerprinted and forcibly returned there in line with EU rules. \n \n- 'Live together or die together' - \n \nIn all they paid more than 9,000 euros ($10,000) to reach Germany. \n \n"I just want a beautiful life for myself, for my wife. I want to live like other people, without tension, without stress, without fear," said Ahmad, his big brown eyes sparkling. \n \nTheir decision to flee Iraq came in February last year, 10 days after their engagement, when Ahmad took his sweetheart for dinner at a restaurant called Mr Chicken. \n \n"There was an explosion and all the glass smashed in our faces," Ahmad said. The scars are still visible, notably on the strikingly pretty Alia who wears her auburn hair tied back in a little bun. \n \nThe daughter of an academic, her studies were stopped by the Islamist groups that emerged after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. \n \n"When I was in school, I was attacked by armed men who threatened to kill me because I wasn't wearing the hijab," said the 26-year-old dressed in a T-shirt, Levi's jeans and trainers with fuchsia-coloured laces. \n \nBut she kept looking forward. "We hope at least some of our dreams will come true," Alia said, on a bus from Belgrade to Kanjiza near Hungary. \n \nAhmad first tried and failed to get asylum in the United States, so opted for an illegal route to Europe. Alia's parents did not want her to risk such a trip, but she felt she had no choice. \n \nAhmad, too, hesitated when he saw the rickety fishing boat their smuggler in Turkey was ordering them to climb into, wanting his wife and baby to turn back. \n \nBut Alia stood firm: "Either we live together or we die together." \n \nPangs of regret overtook her one morning in Budapest, however, when they couldn't find a hotel for lack of documents. Even a miserable brothel a smuggler tried to take them to was full. \n \n- Stress stopped mother's milk - \n \n"I can't tell my mother what we're going through, she would be too upset," Alia wept, her eyeshadow smudged after another sleepless night. \n \nNot only did traffickers take advantage, so too did vendors selling overpriced water, sandwiches and Red Bull -- the energy drink people on the trail guzzled to keep them going -- at every turn. \n \nIn Serbia's Presevo camp, hustlers sold fake permits to enable the migrants to skip a day-long queue. Police wore face masks and refused to answer any of the desperate migrants' pleas. \n \nIn a Belgrade cafe, Ahmad begged a smuggler to drive the family to Budapest. In a rare moment of kindness from a trafficker, the man of Algerian origin refused. \n \n"Haven't you heard about the 71 people found dead in the truck? I'm not taking anyone with babies," the smuggler said. \n \nWhen they finally made it to the Hungarian capital, the family was driven up by another smuggler to the border with Austria and told to walk to the other side. \n \nSix of their travel companions were arrested, but Ahmad and Alia escaped. Imagining his father was only playing, baby Adam giggled as Ahmad ran. \n \nIn mid-week, Alia could no longer nurse her baby. The stress of living like a fugitive had dried up her milk. "Alia hasn't eaten so she can't breastfeed Adam," Ahmad said. "I can't take seeing my son cry." \n \n- 'Not a hotel' - \n \nBut there were also many beautiful moments. \n \n"The harder the journey gets, the stronger our relationship grows," said Alia. \n \nOnce in Vienna, the first city where the couple did not feel persecuted, they had to plan. All this time they had been running, without knowing where to. \n \nAfter much hesitation they settled on the German city of Cologne, where Ahmad's sister lives. They would decide later whether to stay there or continue to Holland where they both have family. \n \nAt the Vienna train station, the couple shared a kebab sandwich. They could almost taste the perfect ending they had dreamed of, in the arms and homes of relatives. \n \nBut in Munich where they were due to change trains, the journey came to a bittersweet stop. \n \nThere were no cheering crowds, only silence as they were detained by German police, taken to a makeshift facility for registration and then to a grim temporary shelter. \n \nAhmad kept up a brave face as he hugged and kissed his weeping wife. "It's OK," he said. \n \nSpeaking to AFP from the camp through the phone app Viber, Ahmad for the first time sounded disillusioned. \n \n"It's really crowded here, we are two families in one tiny room and we are still wearing the same clothes we arrived in," he said. \n \nAlia tried to negotiate a better living space but an official snapped: "This is not a hotel." \n \nBecause of the large number of refugees and migrants arriving in Germany it could be months before the family has a place to call home. \n \n"I thought that we would be able to rest, however it seems we still have a long road ahead," Ahmad said, added: "Thank God, at least we made it." \n \nSource

0188_bfc6a03f-a5a9-4342-b697-6ded1c302d58	The Queen has thanked the nation for its kind messages on the day she becomes the longest reigning monarch in British history. \n\nReflecting on the landmark record, the Queen admitted it was not a milestone she had ever aspired to. \n\nAs she opened the £294 million Scottish Borders Railway in Tweedbank, the Queen said: "Prince Philip and I are very grateful for the warmth of your welcome on this occasion. \n\n"Many ,including you First Minister, have also kindly noted another significance attaching to today although it is not one to which I have ever aspired. \n\n"Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception. But I thank you all and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness." \n\nThe 89-year-old monarch, with the Duke of Edinburgh at her side, has spent the day travelling 40 miles on the railway with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, starting at Edinburgh's Waverley Station, stopping off at Newtongrange in Midlothian before carrying on to the Borders town of Tweedbank. \n\nLater today, the Queen overtakes the record set by her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria to become the nation's longest reigning sovereign, when she will have been on the throne for 23,226 days, 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes. \n\nThe Queen demonstrated her business as usual approach at the end of her short speech by remarking: " So now to the business in hand. It is my very happy duty to declare the Borders Railway open." \n\nThe milestone is tinged with sadness for the Queen as the calculation of the length of her reign is linked to the death of her father, King George VI, and that of Queen Victoria. \n\nThere was no mention of Victoria in the Queen's address but she was wearing her great-great grandmother's diamond bow brooch, which was handed down to her through the generations. \n\nThe Queen began her speech by remarking that she and Philip were delighted to be back in the Borders and to have arrived by train. \n\n"It's been wonderful to witness the excitement which the return of the railway has brought here," she said. \n\nEarlier she was greeted by delighted crowds at Edinburgh's Waverley Station as she stepped onto the polished steam locomotive Union of South Africa with Philip. \n\nThe Queen, the Duke and Ms Sturgeon travelled in a ''Pegasus'' Pullman coach that seats 14 in the main lounge area and also has a bar - that was serving tea and coffee. \n\nThe trio were seated in a pristine private compartment at the end of the coach's lounge area with the Queen's entourage in nearby seats. \n\nTributes have been paid to the monarch with Prime Minister David Cameron declaring in the House of Commons: "The Queen is our Queen and we could not be more proud of her. \n\n"She has served this country with an unerring grace, dignity and decency and long may she continue to do so.'' \n\nMs Sturgeon in her own speech greeted the Queen with ''a simple but heartfelt thank you'' for her work. \n\nShe said: ''We are privileged ma'am that you have chosen to mark today's milestone here. All of us are delighted to be able to share some of this special day with you. For those watching from around the world let me say, on their behalf ma'am a simple but heartfelt thank you.'' \n\nThe rest of the royals carried on with their scheduled diary of engagements, with the Queen's daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall describing the milestone as "marvellous" on a tour of the studios of ITV show This Morning. \n\nThe Queen's son the Duke of York, in a pre-recorded interview with the BBC, spoke of her consistency and leadership. \n\n''It's a milestone in UK terms but as far as her consistency and leadership - it's the normal run of the mill sort of date. It's just one day in her reign," he said. \n\n''So yes it's an extraordinary achievement in some respects, but actually it's about the consistency and the leadership that she is showing and has shown throughout her reign that I think is probably the one thing that marks her up more than anything else.'' \n\nThe exact moment the Queen passes Victoria's milestone is not known as there is no precise time for the death of her father who died in the early hours of February 6 1952. \n\nBut it is thought he probably died at 1am so at around 5.30pm the Queen will make history when she will have reigned for a few minutes longer than Victoria.
0189_bb1e4251-08be-490f-b11b-979cd703d4bb	Thanks to the Internet, cat iconography is ubiquitous and inescapable. However, this is just the continuation of an epic, millennia-strong love affair between two (not so) different species. \n\n10 The First ‘Pet’ Cat\nThe unearthing of a 9,500-year-old cat at a Neolithic burial site in Cyprus has quite possibly pushed back the anthro-felinic timeline by thousands of years. You see, cats are not native to the region and must have been brought there by ancient settlers.\n\nIt was first thought that humans transmogrified wild cats to house cats around 4,000 years ago in Egypt. However, more recent finds credit cat domestication to the Chinese 1,000 years earlier. Since then, older specimens have been found in Northern Africa, but the nearly 10,000-year-old remains unearthed at the Shillourokambos settlement in Cyprus are a downright antediluvian antique.\n\nThis Neolithic Nyan Cat was planted about a 0.3 meters (1 ft) away from its potential human, a person of great importance, judging by the intricate burial trinkets found within. The duo’s grave was littered with a rare assortment of items, including ornamental shells and a small, ceremonial jade axe.\n\nWhy was the kitten entombed alongside a human? Archaeologists aren’t sure, but the eight-month-old mouser definitely wasn’t butchered, strengthening the notion that the cat commanded at least a moderate amount of political sway.\n\n9) Native American Ritual Burial\nNobody knows when humans stopped seeing cats as simple rat-killing machines and adopted them as cuddly companions, but a recent archaeological find has provided a partial answer.\n\nAt a Native American burial mound in what is now western Illinois, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old bobcat. We’ve already talked about an even older cat, so why is this one so special? For one, it’s a historical one-off and the only recorded burial of a bobcat across the entire annals of archaeology. On top of that, it was placed in the middle of 22 human carcasses. It was also found with a fancy shell-and-bear-teeth collar around its neck.\n\nSadly, we might never find out if the Hopewell Native Americans really did try to domesticate bobcats. The feline’s current repository, the Illinois State Museum, is facing financial distress and shutting down. Hopefully, a miraculous cash infusion will save the institution, because if the museum closes, the bones will be made inaccessible by heaps of bureaucratic stupidity.\n\n8) Tokyo’s Cat Temple\nThe Japanese really, really love their cats. In the 18th century, the maneki neko, little white cat effigies with upraised paws, were created to bring prosperity to shop owners and noodle weavers alike. Just like China’s opaque wall of smog, this endearing Japanese character has gradually swept through mainland Asia.\n\nBut when it comes to sheer numbers, no site houses more maneki neko than the legendary Gotokuji Temple in Tokyo’s Setagaya ward. The temple itself is small and unassuming, its facade giving no indication of the ceramic cat chaos within. Step inside, and you’ll see cloisters crowded with tiny white figures. Take a closer look, and you’ll find that they’re all cats!\n\nConsidered home by all maneki neko, Gotokuji Temple’s mythos is fascinating but perhaps not quite 100 percent historically established. Apocryphal or not, the story is as follows: Once upon a time, a wandering feudal lord sought shelter from a tempest underneath a tree not far from the temple. He noticed the priest’s cat beckoning him with its paw and followed it into the temple. Moments later, that same sheltering tree was vaporized by lightning. To honor the portentous pet, the feudal lord created the first maneki neko, beckoning paw and all. \n\n7) Houtong, The Village Saved By Its Cats\nSituated on Taiwan’s northern coast, the village of Houtong was literally saved by cats. It sounds like the plot of a Disney movie, but in the 1970s, this once-proud mining town was on the verge of disintegration, thanks to the emergence of cleaner energy sources, such as oil and gas.\n\nThe population had apocalyptically dwindled from 6,000 to a few hundred, and the little coal hub was in its death throes. Then in 2008, in a miracle that would be par for the course in Hollywood feel-good films, a random cat fan known Internet-wide as “Palin88” staged a photo op for the village’s large cat contingent.\n\nWith hundreds of cats lazing about the streets, Houtong immediately became an online sensation and suddenly needed a tourism board. Now, people are flocking from all corners of the globe to visit the slightly renamed Houtong Cat Village. They descend by the thousands on weekend jaunts to indulge their cat lust and inadvertently save a portion of Taiwanese mining history.\n\n6) Cats And Marriage Beliefs\nFor all their ferocity, would you believe that the Vikings loved cats? They stocked felines to keep home and ship rat-free, and the most renowned of these breeds, the hulking Norwegian forest cat, still thrives in Scandinavia and on Reddit.\n\nBecause of their connection to Freyja, the goddess of getting it on, felines gained mystical status, and the Vikings looked upon all cat-related events as predictors of a fruitful (or fitful) marriage. For example, gifting newlyweds a black cat was a surefire way to ensure wedded bliss for all their days. In contrast to our modern stereotype of the crazy cat lady, all feline-frenzied females were guaranteed to eventually tie the knot.\n\nInterestingly, many other peoples, including the French and English, adhered to the belief that felines doubled as matrimonial crystal balls. Seemingly random factors such as a mew or a sneeze could influence upcoming marriages. Half a Eurasian landmass away, the same beliefs propagated through the Buddhist world, where anything that meowed and had dark fur was considered a prognosticator of future riches. Polydactyl, or thumbed, cats were also considered lucky and fawned over.\n\n5) Kuching Cat Museum\nThe Kuching Cat Museum, in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, is the first institution of its kind and the world’s largest repository of all things feline. Kuching roughly means “Cat City,” and as such, no better place could exist to showcase historical artifacts alongside tacky cat curios from all corners of the globe. In total, over 2,000 pieces from disparate cultures and times are displayed.\n\nOperated under the auspices of Kuching’s North City Hall, the museum isn’t merely a kitschy tourist attraction. It’s also a scholarly place, indulging in history and global cat mythology. To distinguish itself from sleazy roadside attractions of the same theme, the museum is filled with rare, historical goodies, such as a 3,500-year-old Egyptian mummy and the world’s rarest taxidermied cat, the elusive Felis badia of Bornean fame.\n\nIf the museum wasn’t enough, Kuching is rife with cat statues and is also home to the Meow Meow Cafe. \n\n4) Pan-American Jaguar Worship\nBig cats are mostly associated with savannas and other African backdrops, but the stately jaguar is all-American. Endemic to the New World, these animals are inextricably entrenched in all sorts of Pan-American lore.\n\nJaguars are also associated with all sorts of desirable virtues like ferocity and valor. Even its name is awesome, meaning “he who kills in one fell swoop.” The Aztec, Maya, and Inca all revered the animal and enshrined it in their panoply of Gods. Temples were built to honor the jaguar’s magnificence, and the Maya even inducted the ferocious feline as their god of the underworld, complete with priests, called balam, to ordain over all death- and jaguar-related ventures.\n\nThe jaguar also features prominently in Native American legends, often as a guiding figure. In the story of the jaguar and the baby skunk, the former becomes godfather to the latter, teaching his stinky friend to “hunt.” In reality, the skunk was simply tasked with pointing out a target for the large cat to dispose of. Not realizing his limitations, the baby skunk then attempts to bring down a large elk on his own and is summarily killed.\n\n3) Japan’s Cat Islands\nAoshima is one of those rare places where cats heavily outnumber humans. The Japanese island, part of the Ehime prefecture, houses a modest fishing village with six times as many felines as humans. Feedings routinely attract a ubiquity of cats, and the island has grown popular with tourists, much to the chagrin of the few permanent human denizens.\n\nAoshima isn’t alone, either. Tashirojima Island also holds an overwhelming cat contingent, several hundred strong with only around 100 human caretakers to revel in the fluffiness. Residents revere the cats, who were enshrined on the island almost 300 years ago as mousers. Tashirojima was home to a bustling, island-wide silkworm growing operation, and the kitties were brought in to protect valuable worms from rodent predation. Later on, fishermen became so enamored with the animals that they erected a cat stupa, or shrine, at the island’s center.\n\nIf two cat islands aren’t enough for you ailurophiles out there, rest assured that Japan has at least nine other cat islands that you can visit. \n\n2) The Site Of Caesar’s Stabbing Has Been Repurposed Into A Cat Sanctuary\nFormer Roman dictator and salad namesake Gaius Julius Caesar was betrayed and killed by his colleagues at the Theater of Pompey in 44 BC. Now known as Largo di Torre Argentina, this historic site has quite unexpectedly been repurposed into a cat sanctuary.\n\nLocated about 6 meters (20 ft) under age-ravaged Roman streets, the large temple complex was unearthed when Mussolini’s crews were refurbishing the area in 1929. Over the next 80 years, the site of one of history’s most notorious murders bore witness to yet another invasion—feral cats. The multi-tiered structure was apparently irresistible to the city’s many stray cats, and they decided to aggregate within the perfectly sculpted cubbyholes and on top of immaculately shaped colonnades.\n\nRome’s total feline population is around 300,000, and the city’s laws protect cat gathering spots as urban sanctuaries. No one may disrupt any place where five or more cats have made their roost. \n\n1) Nineteenth-Century Cat Meme Photograph\nCat memes are no recent invention. As long as photography has existed, people have been gussying up their felines in human garb and posing them for elaborately staged portraits.\n\nIt all started with 19th-century British photographer and cat meme pioneer Harry Pointer, who cut his teeth taking cat pictures au naturel. That was pretty cool, but he decided that he could boost his appeal by enticing his Brighton Cats, as they came to be known, into reenacting human behaviors. We can’t vouch for his methods, as animal cruelty laws had yet to be invented, and clubbing seals was still legal, but Pointer experimented with several other animals as well. He found that pigs, dogs, and rabbits were stubbornly uncooperative, but young felines were perfectly malleable.\n\nAlmost 40 years later, in 1906, Harry Whittier Frees would achieve the next revolution in feline photography by slapping a party cap on the family cat and unknowingly birthing a new and long-lasting art form.\n\n\nCourtesy of Listverse

0193_999f0322-94e8-4265-945a-c51e22682f82	Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris wants to solve the refugee crisis in Europe by creating two new countries for those fleeing theirs \n\nNaguib Sawiris, the chief executive officer of Cairo-based Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, is worth an estimated $3 billion — he is one of Egypt’s richest men and has had one of the craziest, most ambitious ideas about how to deal with the ongoing refugee crisis plaguing Europe’s politics and infrastructure. He wants to buy two islands, fill them with fleeing refugees, provide them with jobs and give the islands a legitimate legal cover. \n\nIn a rare interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Sawiris explained the amount of paperwork the project will require, saying, “You can’t just take people and put them on an island that you bought. You need a passport control agency. You need people to check them out. You need their data. You need customs.” The next step involves convincing Italy or Greece to part with two of the several little islands scattered around the main landmass. \n\nUpon fruition, Sawiris’ plans will involve the following numbers: Purchase cost of the islands will be anything between $10 million and $100 million, they will take in close to 100,000 to 200,000 refugees and he’s prepared to foot most of the enormous bill. \n\nIn a media release, the billionaire added more details about the venture. A communique from his office read, “Mr Sawiris has identified two privately owned Greek islands that constitute a good opportunity for the project. We have corresponded with their owners and expressed our interest to go into negotiation with them provided they can acquire the approval of the government of Greece to host the maximum number of refugees allowable according to Greek laws.” \n\nThe United Nations, meanwhile, is willing to go dutch. “Mr Sawiris has been approached by UNHCR and is going to meet with them soon to discuss possible areas of co-operation. He welcomes co-operating with the UN refugee agency, provided his idea does not get held back by any bureaucracy,” the note added. \n\nRed tape and “unnecessary criticism” are things the magnate has warned against. He has been tweeting virtually non-stop (even quoting Rabindranath Tagore) ever since his plan was announced and his social media stream targeted by “haters”. \n\nBut how is he planning to shore up so much capital to take this massive humanitarian mission off the ground? The answer is simple — he can. As it turns out, Sawiris is extremely popular in Egypt. His firm, Orascom, runs “mobile telephone networks and underwater communications networks” and is one of the country’s largest employers in the private sector. He has even founded a political party called the Al Masreyeen Al Ahrrar and is part of several of Egypt’s forefront developmental agencies. \n\nThe island buying plan has also made him famous worldwide — the married father of four claims that he has received close to 10,000 emails filled with suggestions and encouragement. “The way they (refugees) are being treated now, they are being treated like cattle. (On the islands), the main thing is investment in infrastructure. There would be temporary shelters to house the people, then you start employing the people to build housing, schools, universities and hospitals,” he told AFP. “And if things improve, whoever wants to go back (to their homeland) goes back,” he added. \n\nAmidst all this noise about “building a continent”, Sawiris has been constantly reminding the world why he’s doing this. It’s for little Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned while trying to make it to Greece’s shores with his family. “That was the moment. The Gulf nations should really be pitching in or trying to help these poor people. I mean, I cannot just sit like that and just do nothing, you know, and pretend that it’s not my problem,” he said during the interview with CNN. \n\nAnd in memory of the child who died without a country, one of the proposed islands will be named ‘Aylan Island’ — a home for all those who have been displaced by war, strife, hunger and some of the greatest mistakes of 21st century humanity.

In fact, the nation’s first president died a slow and bloody death. In his book “Becoming George Washington,” author Steve Yoch says the founding father was a life-long believer in the efficacy of bleeding as a medical treatment. “And because of this,” explains Yoch, “Washington and his physicians virtually guaranteed his death by excessive bleeding.” \n  \nYoch says that on December 12, 1799, Washington ignored a blanket of snow and hail and mounted his horse for a five-hour tour of his farms. He chose not to change out of his wet clothes when he arrived home because dinner was ready and he did not want to inconvenience his guests. \n \nThe next morning, even though the snow had fallen even harder and he was starting to feel sick, Washington went down to the Potomac to inspect another part of his sprawling plantation. That night, he retired for the evening in a cheerful mood and said the best treatment for the cold was to “let it go as it came.” His wife Martha thought he looked terrible, but Washington chose to sit up late in the library reading. In the middle of the night, he woke Martha with throat pain and shortness of breath. Once again, he rejected medical treatment and wanted to rely on his body’s own restorative powers. \n \nIn the morning, Martha would wait no longer and called for Dr. James Craik, one of Washington’s oldest friends and a trusted physician who had served with him since the French and Indian war 40 years earlier. ”Washington always believed that bleeding improved his health,” says Yoch.  “As a young man, he frequently turned to bleeding to address his repeated illness throughout the French and Indian War and it’s only through sheer luck that his physicians didn’t kill him then.” \n \nUnfortunately, he wasn’t so lucky in December of 1799. While waiting for Dr. Craik to arrive, Washington ordered Albin Rawlins, a local clerk, to bleed him. As author Ron Chernow notes in his biography “Washington: A Life,” “When the clerk blanched, Washington gently but firmly pressed him ‘don’t be afraid’ he said. Once Rawlins had sliced into the skin, making the blood run freely, he added, ‘The orifice is not large enough.’ Martha showed better medical judgment and pleaded for a halt to the bleeding. Washington urged Rawlins on, saying ‘More, more!’ until nearly a pint of blood had been drained.” \n \nWhen Craik finally arrived, he immediately drew more blood and applied a treatment of dried beetles to Washington’s inflamed throat. Craik summoned another doctor, Elisha Cullen Dick. As soon as Dick arrived, he and Craik siphoned off even more blood, which “came very slow, was thick, and did not produce any symptoms of fainting.” \n \nHistorians estimate that Washington surrendered five pints of blood all together, or about half of his body’s total supply. Washington probably suffered from a virulent bacterial infection of the epiglottis. As it swells, the epiglottis closes off the windpipe, making breathing and swallowing extremely difficult and eventually impossible. \n \nYoch says that while Washington may have died anyway, “the loss of blood guaranteed his death.” When Washington finally ordered the bleeding to end, he reportedly said “Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go.” His last words were: “Tis well.” \n \nFor more information on George Washington’s early life and his views on bleeding visit www.becominggeorgewashington.com.  
0196_928d3c40-ab7f-4508-8633-14a2ddbd677f	Director M. Night Shyamalan, whose career has been spiraling downward since 2002’s “Signs,” doesn’t return to form with “The Visit,” but it’s still a step up for the former suspense wunderkind. In telling his story of a brother and sister’s week-long stay with their whacked-out grandparents on a Pennsylvania farm, Shyamalan (“The Sixth Sense,” “The Last Airbender,” “Lady in the Water”) delivers his two trademarks: a game-changing third-act twist and a seat-squirming broody moodiness. He also employs several red herrings in pursuit of that “big reveal,” which in some eyes will be seen as either flimsy or predictable. Mainly, Shyamalan’s spookfest suffers from an acute case of monotony. It takes place over five days, each the same as the one before, sans Nana (Tony winner Deanna Dunagan) or Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) periodically going off the rails. Both are not right. At night, she roams the house naked and scratches the walls. He has a problem with soiled diapers. The shock value wears off quickly. In real life, the kids would leave or call for help. But they buy Pop-Pop’s explanation: “What a bunch of confused old fools your grandparents turned out to be.” Then he warns them not to come out of their rooms after 9:30 p.m. For real. The action unfolds in a found-footage way through the lens of 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge), an aspiring documentarian, who along with her 13-year-old brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), is chronicling the first-ever meeting with their estranged grandparents. The device allows Shyamalan to have some fun in a Filmmaking 101 way. There’s a lesson about ironic scores, which Shyamalan employs himself in the end. Isn’t he clever? Despite its cautionary message to let anger go, “The Visit” is thin on logic. For instance, what mother would send her kids off alone to visit people she hasn’t spoken with in 15 years? Once there, Becca is determined to discover the truth of Mom’s (Kathryn Hahn) falling out with her parents. But the central question becomes figuring out why Nana and Pop-Pop act so odd. After about 30 minutes, you don’t care, and the payoff isn’t really worth the investment. Shyamalan delivers a couple of cheap thrills, but Pop-Pop’s incontinence and Nana’s vomiting will only make you regurgitate. The other alleged thrills are all pat, like creepy characters popping up unexpectedly in the dark. The basement is off limits, until it’s not. Doors creak. Is there something in the well? The barn? Under the house? Shyamalan knows how to build suspense. In “The Visit” he’s missing the originality and truly scary inventiveness of “The Sixth Sense” and “Unbreakable.” It’s all stuff you’ve seen before. Page 2 of 2 - Dunagan and McRobbie provide plenty of campy creepiness. As a newly divorced mom, Hahn, a Judd Apatow veteran, is serviceable if a tad miscast. The kids are scarred by their dad’s sudden departure. DeJonge does the de rigueur precocious kid in peril. Oxenbould provides moments of levity as Tyler, the aspiring actor. The real laughs, however unintentional, come when Shyamalan gets serious. In the end, “The Visit” goes nowhere.

0197_3c141c48-2649-42ac-9b53-14ab0550e6b1	- As morcellator cancer lawsuits continue to be filed around the country, The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has agreed to investigate claims that laparoscopic power morcellators spread cancer during gynecological surgeries after a request from Congress. Southern Med Law continues to represent women across the country who are believed to have had undetected uterine cancer spread after gynecological procedures involving power morcellators and had filed and settled the first power morcellator cancer lawsuit in a U.S. federal court for an undisclosed amount. (In Re: Power Morcellator Litigation, MDL Case No. 78) \nGAO’s managing director, Katherine Siggerud, sent a response on September 1 to U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who led the12-member bipartisan Congressional group in asking for the probe. The GAO conducts investigations for the U.S. Congress. According to a report by Philly.com, Ms. Siggerud wrote, "GAO accepts your request as work that is within the scope of its authority." The legislators sent a letter to the GAO on August 7 noting that, "hundreds, if not thousands, of women in America are dead" because of power morcellators. The legislators asked the GAO to determine, among other things, whether the FDA’s expedited approval process for medical devices "sufficiently identified" the cancer risks before the power morcellators entered the marketplace. \n\n"Southern Med Law looks forward to the outcome of the GAO’s investigation because the law firm is representing women who have been seriously or fatally injured allegedly by power morcellators," says Dr. François Blaudeau, founder of Southern Med Law. In July, Dr. Blaudeau settled the first power morcellator cancer lawsuit filed in federal court on behalf of a Pennsylvania widower, Scott Burkhart, whose wife, Donna Burkhart, 53, died of disseminated leiomyosarcoma in February 2013. Donna Burkhart developed the cancer after undergoing a power morcellator hysterectomy in March 2012. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against morcellator manufacturers, LiNA Medical APS, Kebomed AB & LiNA Medical US. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount.(Case No. 5:14-cv-1557) \n\nThe law firm explains that laparoscopic power morcellators are used during a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and a myomectomy (removal of uterine fibroids). The device grinds uterine tissue into pieces so that the fragments can be removed through small (laparoscopic) incisions in the abdomen. It is during the removal of uterine tissue that undetected cancer cells are spread into the peritoneal cavity. \n\nIn November 2014, the FDA warned that power morcellators should be avoided in the majority of women who require a hysterectomy and a myomectomy due to the medical device’s potential to spread undetected cancer cells which greatly reduced a woman’s chances for long-term survival. The law firm notes that after the FDA’s announcement, national health insurance companies including Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth, announced that they would either end or restrict coverage for uterine morcellation procedures. Additionally, in the wake of the FDA’s warning, the FBI decided to investigate power morcellators. According to CBS News, the FBI’s probe includes questioning Johnson & Johnson, the largest power morcellator manufacturer, on what it knew about the cancer risks associated with the morcellators. Johnson & Johnson suspended global sales of the devices after the FDA’s warning. \n\nCourt documents indicate that the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) will hear oral arguments on October 1 on a request from six plaintiffs who filed a request to consolidate all federally filed power morcellator cancer lawsuits. The plaintiffs are asking the panel to transfer 22 pending morcellator lawsuits, and those that are subsequently filed, to the U.S. District Court, District of Kansas. The plaintiffs, who filed claims against various morcellator manufacturers, asked for a consolidation because all the complaints allege that power morcellators used during gynecological procedures can spread and upstage cancer. (In Re: Power Morcellator Litigation, MDL Case No. 78) \n\nAbout Southern Med Law And Filing A Morcellator Cancer Lawsuit \nSouthern Med Law and Dr. François Blaudeau possess a unique understanding of the medical and legal questions at issue in power morcellator cancer lawsuit claims. It is this in-depth knowledge that is tantamount to a successful legal representation that protects the rights of the injured. The staff at Southern Med Law is not only trained in successfully handling your legal needs but also understand the pain and suffering and treatment from a medical point of view, and is committed to protecting the rights of all individuals.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \n \nCMP created a fake company that purported to buy body parts of aborted babies and sell them to researchers. \n \nOver several years, CMP secretly recorded conversations with Planned Parenthood officials who engaged in negotiation for body parts and candidly discussed gruesome aspects of the trade. \n \nJordan said the recently released undercover Planned Parenthood videos are “beyond disturbing.” \n \n“They are outright appalling, and show activity that is not only morally wrong, but appears to be potentially illegal as well,” he said. \n \nRead the tested and proven strategies to defeat the abortion cartel, in “Abortion Free: Your Manual for Building a Pro-Life America One Community at a Time.” \n \n“These videos raise serious questions about this organization’s use of taxpayer funds that cannot go unanswered. It is our duty as members of Congress to ensure taxpayer money is not misused. This subpoena creates a legal obligation that ensures that a judge in Northern California cannot stand in the way of congressional investigations into this matter.” \n \nHe explained that for Congress to make informed decisions about its use of taxpayer dollars, “it is vital that we review the unedited videos to understand the whole truth.” \n \nJudge William Orrick of San Francisco had blocked the release of some of the videos in response to a complaint from the National Abortion Federation, whose leaders are on record in the videos. \n \nAs part of the case, lawyers for CMP and its founder, David Daleiden, on Wednesday went to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to file a mandamus action. \n \nThe filing explains CMP conducted a 30-month undercover investigation of the practice of buying and selling fetal tissue within the abortion industry. \n \n“Their investigation revealed evidence of widespread criminal practices in the industry, including the selling of fetal tissue for profit, the alteration of abortion methods to procure better fetal tissue specimens, the collection of intact fetuses born with beating hearts for research purposes, and the procurement of fetal tissue for research without patients’ knowledge and consent,” the order said. “Each of these practices is a crime under federal law.” \n \nNAF sued Daleiden and CMP “in an attempt to silence free speech on the abortion industry’s sale of fetal body parts,” lawyers from the Thomas More Society said on behalf of CMP. \n \nThe filing with the appeals court followed an unsuccessful effort at the district court to have NAF’s complaint dismissed under California’s anti-SLAPP law. \n \nThe “point of the anti-SLAPP statute is that you have a right not to be dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights,” the legal team explained. \n \nThe lawyers told the appeals judges, “This case involves an extraordinary gag order, followed by an equally extraordinary discovery order.” \n \nThe district court’s order prevents Daleiden “from speaking publicly on matters of paramount public interest that have dominated national headlines for weeks.” \n \nAnd its discovery decision ordered the center “to participate in burdensome and intrusive discovery relating to a motion for preliminary injunction.” \n \n“This court should hold that the district court’s order compelling CMP to participate in discovery must be dissolved for two independent reasons: (1) no discovery is necessary to resolve the pending motion for preliminary injunction, because any injunction in this case would manifestly violate the First Amendment’s ironclad prohibition on prior restraints on free speech; and (2) California law, applicable in federal court … requires the district court to rule on the anti-SLAPP motion prior to conducting discovery in the case.” \n \nIn a similar, separate ruling, another court previously determined that the First Amendment allowed CMP to release the disputed videos. \n \nBut the congressional subpoena means the videos can be forwarded to Congress for its purposes – whether or not a California judge is suppressing them. \n \nWND has reported on the videos – 10 so far – as they have been released. They are posted online. \n \nThe most recent showed the abortionists were aware of how bad it would look if word got out about their baby-parts business. \n \n“This is important,” said Vanessa Cullins, the vice president of external medical affairs for Planned Parenthood. “This could destroy your organization and us, if we don’t time those conversations correctly.” \n \nAnd Deborah VanDerhei, the national director of Planned Parenthood ‘s Consortium of Abortion Providers, said, “Think New York Times headline when you’re creating your policy.” \n \nShe explained it’s an issue “you might imagine that we’re not that comfortable talking about on emails.” \n \n“And so we want to have the conversation in person,” VanDerhei said. \n \n“I think a congressional hearing from, you know, scared the bejeezus out of people 15 years ago … so we just want to not have to repeat that again.” \n \nRead the tested and proven strategies to defeat the abortion cartel, in “Abortion Free: Your Manual for Building a Pro-Life America One Community at a Time.” \n \nCMP noted the sale or purchase of human fetal tissue is a federal felony punishable by up to 10 yeas in prison or a fine of up to $500,000. \n \nSee the most recent video: \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video    Click here for reuse options!

(Photo: Adam Bettcher, ) \n\nThe Lions will try to right their ship on Sunday against the Vikings with a 1 p.m. game at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. \n\nFollow the action here with updates throughout the game by Rod Beard of The Detroit News. \n\nLions close gap with Calvin Johnson TD \n\nAfter looking to be nearly out of it, the Lions have responded with a TD drive, capped by an 11-yard pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson. The play was reviewed because Johnson's feed looked to be out of bounds, but the call on the field stood, cutting the Vikings' lead to 17-10 at halftime. \n\nJohnson only had 3 catches on 5 targets, but the touchdown was critical in getting some momentum heading into the locker room. Stafford looked to be a tad more accurate and got the Lions into position with his arm. \n\nThe Vikings got another big play from Adrian Peterson on a makeshift play from Teddy Bridgewater avoided a sack and ended up being a 49-yard pass play. They settled for a field goal, though, leaving the door open for the Lions. \n\nLions finally get on the scoreboard \n\nFollowing their best drive of the game, the Lions had to settle for a field goal after the drive stalled. Matthew Stafford went 7-for-8 on the drive, hitting seven different receivers in the possession, but couldn't get into the end zone. They picked up a couple of third-down conversions and got Calvin Johnson involved a little, but still spread the ball too much and didn't get Johnson going the way that the Vikings have with Adrian Peterson. \n\nThe defense still hasn't shown that they can stop the Vikings and has been on the field for two extended drives. A stop would be helpful, along with a drive for a touchdown. \n\nLions dig an early hole against Vikings \n\nAfter jumping to an early lead last week against the Chargers, the Lions have dug an early hole in the first quarter today against the Vikings. They haven't been able to get much of anything going offensively and the defense hasn't had an answer for Adrian Peterson, who has 13 carries for 70 yards. He appeared to have a touchdown run but a replay review showed that he didn't get in the end zone before his knee was down. \n\nIn any case, the Vikings have dominated the early line play on both sides of the ball. The defensive line hasn't been able to get a good hold on Peterson and the offensive line hasn't created any holes for Joique Bell or protection for Stafford on pass plays. \n\nLions defense picks up from last week \n\nThe Vikings went to Adrian Peterson seven times on their opening drive and the Lions didn't have much of an answer. Peterson totaled 45 yards, including a 25-yard burst. A key play was a quarterback draw by Teddy Bridgewater for a first down, inside the 10-yard line. \n\nThe defense was a sieve last week, allowing almost 500 yards to the Chargers, along with 30 straight points. \n\nWhat to do to not go 0-2 \n\nThrow the ball to Calvin Johnson more. And Golden Tate. And don't give up 30 straight points. \n\nThat would be an easy entry and it's somewhat that simple. The offense has so many options that sometimes it's hard to get balance in assuring that Johnson, Tate and the others get enough touches. In any game, there's an urge to spread the ball around to Eric Ebron, Ameer Abdullah, Joique Bell and Theor Riddick. That's six weapons that Matthew Stafford has and offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi joked that general manager Martin Mayhew should get some of the blame for having so many pieces. It's a legitimate point, but it's up to Lombardi and Stafford to figure things out. Lombardi also said that in some games, there won't be that balance and the numbers of touches will fluctuate. \n\nMore importantly will be the defense, which has to keep an eye on Adrian Peterson, while ensuring that Teddy Bridgewater doesn't keep his streak of completing 70 percent of his passes in five of the last six games. He has a better receiving weapon in Mike Wallace and if they can achieve a run-pass balance, that could give the Lions defense some problems. DeAndre Levy is out again at linebacker but the Lions have the rest of their defense healthy and playing. Brandon Pettigrew won't play today at tight end, which puts a bigger premium on the blocking up front for the offensive line. \n\nWith Green Bay as the only team in the division with a win in the opening week, it's important for the Lions not to fall too far back -- funny to be saying that in week 2, but it's true. They played ahead for most of the season last year, so they'll need some margin of error in case they need a tiebreaker down the stretch. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1F9lDWz

She deserves to enjoy life after all she’s been through. \n\n‘She’s so happy with John. He’s a top bloke, friendly, honest, trustworthy, everything she needs. All her friends and family are thrilled for them.’ \n\nThe mother-of-two started dating Mr McGee in early 2013, and they have been living together for more than a year. \n\nPhotos emerged of the happy couple in June, taken while they were on holiday in Rome and Kent. \n\nThe holiday snaps prompted friends to ask if wedding bells were on the horizon, with one commenting on the Rome picture: ‘You married yet?!!!’  \n\nBut Ms Rathband replied: ‘We’re committed to not getting married.’ \n\nOther close friends of the pair expressed their joy at Mrs Rathband’s new-found happiness. \n    \nWedding bells: Friends were questioning in June whether they would get married, when a set of holiday snaps of the pair emerged on Facebook \n\nOne friend wrote: ‘Ahh you look so good together.’ \n\nWhile another said: ‘The eyes have it. Proper smiley happy eyes.’  \n\nOne photo showed the couple lounging on Goggglebox stars Steph and Dom’s sofa at their B&B in Kent. \n\nPC Rathband was on duty in Newcastle when killer Moat shot him in the face with a sawn-off shotgun in July 2010. \n\nMoat hunted down his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and her boyfriend Chris Brown, 29, and shot them in cold blood using a shotgun two days after he was released from HMP Durham in 2010. \n\nMs Stobbart survived the attack, while her ex-boyfriend went on the run and the next day shot and blinded PC Rathband. \n  \nTragedy: Killer Raoul Moat (left) shot and blinded PC David Rathband in a savage attack with a sawn-off shotgun in Newcastle \n   \nBrave: The couple's marriage broke down following the shooting, as Mrs Rathband said they had underestimated the impact that the blinding would have on her husband \n\nMoat was hunted down by police and found in Rothbury, Northumberland, where he shot himself during a six-hour stand-off with armed police after a week on the run. \n We knew that our lives were to change for ever, but we didn’t know how difficult it was going to be and the challenges that David would face.  Widow Kath Rathband  \nPC Rathband spent nearly three weeks in hospital recovering from the attack, but was told that he would never see again. \n\nThe officer became a national hero after the shooting, setting the The Blue Lamp Foundation to help emergency service workers who have been injured while doing their jobs. \n\nHe was even honoured at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards in November 2010 for his bravery and charity work. \n\nBut he was never able to escape the deep depression into which he sank after being shot. \n\nSpeaking after the attack, Kath said: ‘He would see horrible things – children without faces and skeletons. He’d reach out to touch them. \n\n‘We knew that our lives were to change for ever, but we didn’t know how difficult it was going to be and the challenges that David would face. \n   \nNational hero: PC Rathband was honoured for his bravery and charity work following the shooting, after he set up The Blue Lamp Foundation to help injured emergency service workers \n   \nDepression: But PC Rathband (pictured with an unidentified woman) was unable to escape the deep depression caused by his sudden blindness \n\n‘We didn’t know the impact it would have on him – psychologically, emotionally and physically.’ \n\nMr Rathband moved out of the family home in August 2011 after it emerged he was having an affair with another woman. \n\nAlthough Ms Rathband had put up with previous affairs, his last, with 7/7 London bombing survivor Lisa French, effectively ended the marriage. \n\nMs Rathband broke the news to her husband prior to him flying out for a holiday in Australia with his identical twin Darren. \n\nThe former policeman grew desperate after the collapse of his marriage and struggled to cope with his irreversible disability, posting a series of tormented messages on Twitter. \n   \n'First step': The inquest into PC Rathband's death found that the shooting was the trigger for the series of events that led up to his death \n\n‘Disaster. Job lost, eyes lost, family lost, wife and marriage lost, what a year.’ \n\nAnother read: ‘RIP PC Rathband.’ \n\nMr Rathband was found hanging at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, on February 29 2012. \n\nCoroner Eric Armstrong urged none of those involved to blame themselves. \n\nThe inquest heard Mr Rathband had made threats to kill himself and told his new partner he attempted to hang himself but could not go through with it. \n\nBut his widow Kath and police colleagues she alerted, while concerned for his well-being, did not consider him to be at immediate risk of suicide. \n\nThe inquest found the shooting by Moat was the ‘first step’ in a series of events that led to his death. \n\n

0207_2829b43e-8490-4da6-a180-4f8cac57929b	Volcano and Crater Hike \n \nThis Volcano De San Salvador has a beautiful green crater and the pleasant hike and surrounded by lush green trees.  Benjamin specializes in bird watching and brought a telescope to point out several in the tress for us to get an up close look at. We then went and had a fantastic meal at La Pampa Restaurant. \n \n\n\nPrawns and Steak Meal \n I had a very tender steak and several large prawns cooked in garlic. La Pampa Restaurant has several locations around the country you will pass on your travels and I would recommend you have more than one meal there. They are open for lunch and dinner. The next morning after breakfast at the hotel we got in our van and Benjamin and our driver Miguel drove the 4 of us on a 2 hour drive to the Puerto Barillas Marina and Lodge  . \n\n\nBlack Jesus Mural \n \nAlong the scenic drive we visited a few charming  towns that are famous for their beautifully decorated ruralist painted murals as well as stopping along the side of the road to get fresh cashews and a variety of sweet fruit. A local favorite is a fresh coconut, drink the water then eat the meat, a perfect healthy snack for the drive. \n \n\n\nFresh Fruit Roadside \n \nThroughout the country they have a bounty of tasty bananas, pineapple, coconuts, mangos and several other exotic fruits you have never heard of so give them a try. You'll find several exotics as drinks in the restaurants as well. I enjoyed the Hibiscus juice with a meal. \n   \n\n\nFresh Coconut Roadside \n \n\n\nMarina Lodge Bungalow \n The Puerto Barillas Marina and Lodge is charming in its individual bungalows set in the trees and their outdoor covered restaurant is a five minute walk from your room and right on the water.    \n\n\nRelaxing At Puerto Barillos Marina Lodge \n \nThe Lodge is part of the unspoiled Bahia De Jiquilisco biosphere reserve. Here at the lodge you can book many tours including a guided Kayak Tour through the mangroves where many colorful birds, fish and crocodiles live. It is a great way to start the morning after breakfast. I really loved their Spider Monkey Sanctuary Tour where we fed them bananas as they descended from the trees above us. \n \n\n\nFeeding The Wild Monkeys \n \n\n\nMommy and Baby \n \nDuring the civil war the fighters living in the jungle killed most all of the country's monkeys for food. This sanctuary is now the only place you can see and interact with them in the entire country. We started our days early because in the rainy season it usually rains around 5 pm for an hour or two. \n   \n\n\nOur Turtle Adventure Boat \n Next the lodge took us on a Sea turtle Conservation Tour to visit the Turtle Hatchery and have lunch. We boarded a local boat which took us through the mangroves to a local waterfront dock for a nice red snapper lunch. The fish were caught that morning by the local fisherman.  \n\n\nLocal Boys Enjoy A Swim \n \n\n\nRed Snapper Lunch \n \nYoung boys played in the water around the dock as we ate. The Turtle Hatchery is run by ICAPO charity and is set up to protect and repopulate the highly endangered Hawksbill Turtle. \n \n\n\nTurtle Hatchery \n \nThe hatchery is run by a youngish 20's group of trained dedicated volunteers, who work with the locals and pay them by the eggs that they find. The local fisherman report around the clock no matter the time of night where they've spotted the turtles in the act of laying eggs and let the trained staff move in and remove the buried eggs into the protected hatchery. Sometimes the locals just bring the new eggs right to the Hatchery but that is not ideal since they are very fragile. Up until 2009 it was legal to eat turtle eggs and locals love the treat, so this was causing the turtle population to vanish. Now with this successful program and locals on board to help they have been able to release each season 40,000 to 50,000 new turtles into the water safely.   This tour and lunch cost a group up to 6 people $230. Only around $40 per person. Our tour concluded with a Rodeo Capture of a turtle in the bay. The staff if they can spot a turtle will have local fisherman surround it with a fishing net, the turtle gets curious and come to the net. The staff get in the water and then bring the turtle onto your boat. Here they can measure its size, scrape a small skin sample for DNA and tag the turtle. \n \n\n\nOne Big Turtle Onboard \n \nOn our trip they pulled a huge 200 pound turtle into our boat and it was very exciting. They put a wet cloth over turtles eyes to keep it calm. Within a few minutes the work was done and the turtle was back in the water off swimming away. \n \n\n\nSpotted Eagle Ray \n The staff also grabbed a beautiful spotted stingray caught in the net which they held up for us to admire before releasing it safely back into the water. To learn more about their work visit ICAPO site .   The highlight of the trip for me was the Turtle and Spider Monkey Tours which you book through the lodge. Both were highly educational and thrilling to be a part of. The Marina and Lodge offer so much more from great fishing tours, sailing, bird watching and bike riding . That evening while rain poured down we enjoyed in our air conditioned bungalow a terrific dinner, (chicken, fish or steak) with apple pie and ice cream. And yes the water is fine in El Salvador so we ate salad and fruit that was washed and nobody got sick on the trip. You can brush your teeth with tap water in the hotels. All the hotels we stayed in were well air conditioned, making for a great nights sleep. And they use American money so no need here to change currency on arrival. The next morning we headed out early again for a 3 hour drive to an organic Indigo farm. All along our drives we saw horses and cattle off to the side of the road and lots of local friendly dogs. Surprisingly there aren't many goats in the country.    \n\n\nSimple Life \n   \n\n\nLocal Improvised Buses \n \nThere are many regular buses for locals to get around but in the small towns we also saw converted trucks which serve locals with a stand up open air ride for the price of a quarter. Driving around the country i noticed that every Gas Station which also had a air conditioned 7-11 like convenience store attached had a hired private security armed guard out front. This keeps would be criminals away. There is a lot of poor on poor crime so all nice restaurants as well have armed security out front that way they discourage problems. \n \n\n\nArmed Guards At Gas Stations \n Hacienda Los Nacimientos  is one of only 2 certified Organic Indigo Farms in the world . Owner Rhina deRehmann  will give you a wonderful and educational tour of her farm and show you how they take the indigo from the plant  through the washing process and into that spectacular blue color dye. She then ships her entire inventory to Turkey where The Gap, Levi's and Bennetonturn it into children's jeans and jackets. Going organic means there are no allergy problems. But being organic is much harder and of course much more expensive. Rhina is very proud of their work. As her farm grows they are employing more locals which is great for the community.  \n\n\nWashing the Organic Indigo \n \nIndigo is the most famous of all dyes and the hardest to get just right. It is the only dye that doesn't fade in sunlight. You will learn how the plant is grown then cut, and the seeds collected. They export 800 kilos of Indigo this year have have requests for double that amount. \n \n\n\nCreate Your Own Indego Scarfs \n \nThe tour includes each visiting member a lesson on how to dye a white scarf with the blue indigo and using marbles and other small wood blocks you will create your own design. It is a great souvenir from your tour. The farm also grows cashews and makes cashew wine. \n   \n\n\nPapusas Lunch \n \nAll throughout the country including here at the indigo farm Pupusas is the local snack or a quick lunch . They are made with pork or beef, a popular one is filled with cheese and beans, some are made with a local flower and with all you get a side of tomato sauce to dip them in. The cost from a quarter to seventy five cents each. We enjoyed a Pupusas lunch with Rhina and her husband. \n   \n\n\nWhite Church \n Back on the road we headed to the small town of Suchitoto  with it's beautiful white church. This town had the nicest hotel in the entire country, Los Almendres de San Lorenzo . A wonderful mix of Spanish hacienda with a Moroccan influence. The owners spend many years living in Europe and brought spectacular furnishings with them.  \n\n\nLoved My Two Story Villa \n \n\n\nHotel Pool and Restaurant \n \nMy two level suite slept four, had a beautiful balcony overlooking the mountains and lake in the distance. I enjoyed a nice swim in the hotel pool, watched colorful geckos and birds abound the lush plants that line the hotel. We had a wonderful dinner that night in the Hotel restaurant. That afternoon after shopping in the town for local handmade souvenirs and we explored the towns dramatic large white church. El Salvador is a very catholic country.  \n \n\n\nAmazing Grilled Lunch \n \n\n\nCozy Charming Cafe \n   \n\n\nBeautiful Cafe View \n \nThe next day we were back on the road for a few hour drive to explore 2 Mayan Ruin Archaeology sites of Joya de Ceven and  Cihvatan. There are 4 major Mayan Ruins and all can be seen in one day of driving around. At Joya de Ceven we saw the remains of a Mayan village that was buried below in 20 feet of Volcanic rock and ash from the Volcano eruption (think Pompeii) and sat undiscovered for close to a 800 years till a construction crew digging for a building project in the 1970's hit into a base of a Mayan house.   \n \n\n\nMayan House Ruins \n \n\n\n1000 Year Old Mayan Family House \n \nAt this site you will see how the family lived, slept, cooked. And there is an interesting Shaman house and community building for ceremonies. There is a sauna or hot house remains, and one that has been fully reconstructed for you to see how it looked back in the day. In the museum here you will see the Mayan pottery, jewelry, plus black volcanic carved spear heads for hunting. They even have the fossil of a duck that was tied to a string left at the family house when the villagers fled before the Volcano erupted. \n   \n\n\n1000-1500 Year Old Mayan Temple \n \nA short 40 minute ride took us to a spectacular Mayan temple at Cihvatan . Here going back 1500 years they built 4 temples each on top of the other. The first one is so old it is now completely under the earth. The other 3 temples are spectacular to see. There is a huge green grass field next to the temple where the warriors played a soccer like game now called The Ball Game .  They used a rubber ball about 20 inches, the goal of the game was to pass the ball around without it touching your hands, and get ball to pass thru one of the rings which were very high on a stone wall.. Not always but sometimes the winning team was then sacrificed, put to death at the temple. The logic was that the best warriors needed to die to enter the underworld and fight the demons that were causing all the hardship here on earth to the village.  They assumed the volcano eruptions were the Demons acting up.  \n \n\n\nMayan Pottery \n We had a our last dinner at the terrific El Jardin de Celeste . Known as one of the best restaurants in the country I had great veal shank while others opted for the famous steaks. Everyone was very happy we came here. Like many of the country restaurants it was open air but covered from the sun and rain. The restaurant had some wonderful flowers and gardens.    \n\n\nRestaurant Featured Beautiful Flowers \n We slept our last night at Casa Degraciela  a very nice Boutique Hotel in the town of Ahuachapan .  This was a very charming town for shopping and like all the towns shuts down early around 8 pm on weeknights. The walls were thin and I was able to hear others outside but after a full day on the road I had no problem sleeping in my air conditioned room.   \nOur last afternoon before heading to the airport we headed up the winding mountain road and visited Cerro Verde a spectacular Volcano  park which offers very nice 2 hour hiking tour of the volcano. \n \n\n\nStunning Cerro Verde Volcano \n Here we saw the ruins of a once beautiful hotel that was abandoned years ago shortly after it opened and is now overgrown with flowers and moss. El Salvador is a wonderful country to explore and I recommend you contact the El Salvador Tourism Office and hire my new friend Benjamin Rivera for a guided tour of scenic and fascinating country.

0209_5c8abac9-cbea-4cf9-bb08-5a607669b6f0	The first murder I can remember hearing about was committed with a baseball bat. I was sitting in the living room of the mission house in Fort Yukon, Alaska, having a tea party with my dolls, when the words "murdered," "decapitated," "baseball bat," and "drunk" floated past my ears, drifting over from a nearby conversation. I never learned more. Many years later, I asked my parents about the specifics, but they couldn't recall. I knew from then on, though, that the world was more than what I saw in front of me. But knowing that something like murder exists isn't the same as understanding what it really means. And until my senior year of high school in Fairbanks, a city 140 air miles southwest of Fort Yukon, murder was something that involved only strangers. \n\nFor five years when I was a child, my family lived in Fort Yukon, a Gwich'in Athabascan community where many people lived a subsistence lifestyle, hunting and fishing, trapping and gathering their food. My father was priest-in-charge of St. Stephen's, the Episcopal church established there in the late 19-century. I loved growing up in Fort Yukon; I felt free and alive as a kid, close to something powerful in the river and the light and the trees. But, despite the peaceful simplicity of a schedule dictated by the seasons, it was not always an easy place to live. Violence and tragedy were an intimate part of life. \nSome of my friends from high school think that I'm obsessed with the murder. But I don't want the silence to be the story. \nBack then, a lot of the area's strife came through the mission house. The phone would ring in the night and my dad would leave, or someone would bang on the door, shouting, and my parents would let him in, or a grieving mother would sit on our couch for days at a time, numbly accepting food, crying under a blanket. When there was death, people talked openly and worked together to do what had to be done: The young men dug the graves, lighting fires to thaw the ground in the winter; the grandpas built the coffins; the grandmas sewed and beaded; the women cooked. Death was not sanitized or ignored; it was understood. \n\nWhen I was six, my family moved to Fairbanks. At first, I loved my new surroundings. But after the glamour of the well-lit grocery stores, the McDonald's, and the local swimming pool wore off, I just wanted to go home—or at least, what I still considered home—to Fort Yukon. I didn't feel safe in Fairbanks. If you lost something on the street, it was unlikely that you'd ever find it again. There were places we were told to avoid on our walks to school, like the bike path along the river. But still, I remained a mostly oblivious, mostly happy child. It wasn't until a murder in Fairbanks in 1989 that I really felt the stark differences between the two places where I'd grown up: One of my friends brutally murdered another one of my friends, and the ensuing silence in Fairbanks around the murder compounded the shock of the crime itself. \n\nOnly now, decades later, am I beginning to understand why people in Fairbanks went quiet, so unlike the people in Fort Yukon. Some of my friends from high school think that I'm obsessed with the murder, that I need to let it go, to move on. They've made their peace with the past, they say, and I should, too. But I don't want the silence to be the story. \n     \nOn January 4, 1989, 16-year-old Byran Perotti kidnapped Johnny Jackson, 18, at gunpoint from the parking lot of Los Amigos, the Mexican restaurant where Johnny worked, and drove on Lathrop Street to the Tanana River, about three miles away. According to court documents , Byran held Johnny hostage for an hour and a half in his truck before walking him across the ice to an island one hundred yards away and shooting him twice in the head. Byran then stripped Johnny's body, poured gasoline on it, and attempted to burn the corpse. When that failed, he hid Johnny's remains under an embankment, surrounded by snow and frozen dirt. \n\nByran and I knew each other from church, St. Matthew's, the historic Episcopal church on the Chena River, which runs through downtown Fairbanks. He was a year younger than I was, but we would hang out after the service, prowling aimlessly around the building. We once shared a meaningless kiss in a dark bathroom, as teenagers sometimes do. We didn't interact much at school because we were in different grades and social circles, but settled for the nod and smile when we passed each other in the hallways. \n From left: Byran's yearbook photo; Johnny's senior picture.     \nByran liked attention and tried constantly to generate it. Once, he procured an old couch, which he somehow stowed at school. He would lounge on this couch during school assemblies, directly in front of the bleachers where his classmates sat, just for a laugh. Byran and his friends would catcall girls in the hallways, flipping up their skirts and snapping their bras. (This was back when such actions were generally dismissed with an amused "boys will be boys" eye roll.) \n\nAt some point during his sophomore year, Byran acquired a girlfriend. He went to extremes, always: jockeying for the title of class clown, starving himself to cut weight for wrestling, public displays of affection with his girlfriend—not just kissing and hand-holding, but flowers and stuffed animals at school. He kept taking his parents' car after they were asleep to go to her house. His parents didn't know what to do; he wouldn't listen to them. Finally, his father threatened to call the police if Byran took the car again. Byran did it again, and his father called the police. \n\nMy mother was a good friend of Byran's parents, and sometimes our families would get together for meals. She told me about their struggles with Byran. No one at school seemed to know about Byran getting into trouble at home, and I didn't think much of it. I was distracted by my own life, focused on my schoolwork and getting into college. \n\nI was working out at a local gym in early January when I heard on the radio that Johnny was missing. I was on the bench press. I put the bar back on the rack and lay there for a minute, thinking, praying. It wasn't that unusual for people to go missing in Fairbanks; we'd gotten somewhat used to that, unfortunately, over the years. It usually meant they were dead, though, and that they'd been murdered, rather than an accidental death like drowning, which was more likely to happen in a place like Fort Yukon, where people regularly travelled on the nearby rivers. \n\nJohnny was goofy and charming, with a smallish build but big feet, like he still had a lot of growing to do. He wore black-and-white checkered Vans and talked to everyone, ignoring the strange high school etiquette that discourages interaction between social groups. Johnny and I hadn't quite dated, but we'd hung out over the years. We held hands under a blanket at a party once, went to see "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" when it was in theaters, and stayed friends after he graduated. He worked in the kitchen at Los Amigos, and liked to roller skate, I remember. \n\nIn the spring of 1988, nine months prior to the murder, Byran's girlfriend was overheard by a school official telling a friend that Johnny had raped her when they went out on a date a month or so earlier, before she had started seeing Byran. The school official reported it, but upon being questioned by the police, Byran's girlfriend declined to press charges. Johnny, according to court documents, "adamantly denied any assaultive conduct." Citing a lack of evidence, the police declined to go forward with the case. \n\nThe accusation was generally understood not to be true. I didn't think it was true.  It was like a big open secret, an opinion we all shared and didn't feel the need to discuss. Even Byran doubted the claim: He told his family that he wasn't exactly sure what had happened, because his girlfriend refused to give him any details. But he became consumed with the idea of defending her honor, taking the alleged assault as a personal affront and twisting it into a very public vendetta against Johnny. In a letter to his girlfriend dated May 11, 1988, Byran wrote: \n\nThis may sound egotistical, and possessive, but he took something that was mine—it was and is a part of me, it was, is, like he did it to me, even though I don't know what happened or exactly how much he hurt you. But he stole something that is very precious to me, something that cannot be returned. I want it back, and by doing what I'm going to do, I will gain something that is equally precious to him. \n\nThe suggestion here is that that Johnny and Byran's girlfriend had sex. Perhaps she regretted it and called it rape, or perhaps Byran was just jealous that anything might have happened at all. \n     \nWhen Johnny's disappearance was broadcast on the radio, I didn't immediately think of Byran, though I should have. Byran had been stalking Johnny for months, broadcasting his intent to kill him. It's strange, but somehow, we ignored the threats. Byran talked a big game, but we all, everyone at school, had assumed that the truth—the reality that Johnny was innocent of the crime he had been accused of—would save him from Byran's anger. \n\nJohnny tried to brush off the menacing remarks, but Byran was hard to ignore. \n\nByran threatened Johnny to his face, following him around town, sometimes waiting outside Los Amigos. He said repeatedly to Johnny's friends and his own friends that Johnny deserved to die. He glared at me when I told him I didn't think Johnny was capable of hurting anyone, that I'd gone out with him too, that he was harmless, and kind. "Fuck that, I don't care," Byran said as he walked away. \n\nIt seems crazy now that we didn't try to do more to help, that we didn't heed the warning signs. I think it was just impossible to imagine that Byran would ever really do anything more than talk. He was just looking for attention, we thought. \n\nA childhood friend who works in law enforcement in Fairbanks says that the answer, now, is simple: "He was homicidal, and needed someone to kill." That is to say, if it wasn't Johnny, it would have been someone else. A 2006 study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine  notes that "attempts to develop models that predict violence have in part been unsuccessful from the fact the ideation is common." Byran said later that he told everyone he was going to do it, that we should have taken him seriously. It's difficult to know when teenagers are just fantasizing about killing someone and when they actually plan on doing it. \n\nThere were rumors that Byran's girlfriend recanted and told him that Johnny hadn't raped her, but it was too late. Even if Johnny wasn't guilty of assault, in Byran's eyes he may have had sex with her, and that was just as bad an offense. He told me later, "I didn't kill him because he raped –––. I killed him because he wouldn't go away." \n     \nIn January, the sun lingers briefly on the horizon at mid-day in Fairbanks, sleepily bathing the city in dim light for a couple of hours before it slips away again. Byran was arrested on a Sunday, in the late afternoon, after dark. That morning, he and I had served together at the altar at St. Matthew's. One of us, I don't remember who, was the crucifer, bearing the cross. The other was an acolyte. We'd goofed around as usual, trying to make each other laugh during the service. His father called our house a few hours later. My mother answered the phone, listened, spoke briefly, hung up, and turned to me, where I was drying dishes at the kitchen sink: "Byran's been arrested for Johnny Jackson's murder." \n\nMy mother went to sit with Byran's family at their house. I sat in my room, alone. I pressed my hand, and then my cheek, to an exterior wall; it was cold, -60 outside. I called Byran's best friend to tell him, not yet knowing he had been involved in the sting operation that led to Byran's arrest. The friend had arranged, my mother told me later that night, to have Byran meet him at his father's car dealership, where the police were waiting, after they'd already listened in on a conversation during which Byran described the murder in detail, saying that he'd take this friend out to where Johnny's body was buried in the coming summer, that they'd have a party. \n"By doing what I'm going to do, I will gain something that is equally precious to him." \nAt school the morning after the arrest, the hallways were buzzing, partly with shock, but also with the thrill of intrigue and scandal. There was a competition as to who knew Byran and Johnny best, who was closest to the whole situation, who deserved to be the most upset. I can still hear the chillingly matter-of-fact tone with which I delivered the news to a teacher who hadn't heard: "Byran Perotti killed Johnny Jackson,"  I said blankly. She gasped. I continued: "He shot him twice in the head and tried to burn the body." Her hands went to her face. Her eyes went to the desk in her classroom where Johnny used to sit. \n\nByran later told me about the arrest, in one of our many phone calls in the months immediately after he killed Johnny. He sounded excited as he described how he'd walked in to the darkened dealership office, how several police officers had stood up from where they'd been crouching behind desks, how they'd pointed their guns at him, shouting "Freeze!" He was sure he never would have been caught if he hadn't talked so openly to his friend, nor would they have found Johnny's body had he refused to cooperate. \n\nByran took great personal satisfaction in the killing; he didn't want to make Johnny's death look like a suicide. Byran wanted the murder to be known, and told more than a few people about it in the days afterward. This psychological component was much of the reason he was tried as an adult and why his sentence of 99 years was upheld. \n\nThe Byran I knew, the Byran with the easy, twinkly grin, was as dead as the boy he shot. That was almost harder to believe than Johnny's death, because in the aftermath of the murder, Byran was still alive. He was on the other side of the glass; he was next to me in the visiting room at the jail; he was there, in letters and phone calls. \n\nI can't completely explain why I continued to have contact with Byran, why I didn't withdraw and protect myself. I didn't want to abandon him. Despite what he'd done, I still wanted to see him as someone who deserved, and needed, love. \n     \nBut then, after Johnny's funeral, no one talked about the murder, or Byran, or even Johnny. Parents, friends, priests, teachers—nobody seemed to know what to say. The silence grew, becoming as deep and cold as the chill outside. The shock was too much, it seemed; the center, if there was one, could not hold, and Fairbanks just moved on from the whole mess like it never happened. The days lengthened, and as winter became spring the only person I talked to about Byran was Byran himself. I wrote to him at the correctional center in Fairbanks where he was being held; he wrote back and started calling the house as soon as he was allowed access to a phone. He seemed lonely and confused and terrified. \n\nI tried to hold on, but after a few months, I couldn't anymore. I stopped answering his letters. After I graduated from high school that spring, my parents and sister made plans to move to North Dakota, because my father got a new job. I packed up my childhood in a few cardboard boxes. \n\nI was eighteen the last time I spoke with him, sitting on the front steps of my parents' new house in Fargo, a day or two before my father dropped me off for college on the East Coast. I left Alaska and Byran and Johnny and the murder and everything else behind me, or so I thought. \n\nWhen I went to college, I didn't talk about the murder. I didn't want it to be a part of the new life I was making for myself. And because my parents had left Alaska, too, there was no home for me to go back to, which made it easy to pretend that the murder had never taken place. The silence grew stronger over time. \n     \nFive years later, in 1994, while sitting in a Starbucks, I happened upon an issue of USA Today . Unconsciously, I looked at the paper's state-by-state news briefs. My eyes scanned Alaska first, and the text hit me like a brick: "Two drunk escaped murderers surrendered after finding themselves boxed by road blocks, sharpshooters, and snow-covered Mount Marathon … Byran Perotti, serving 99 years … escaped Tuesday from Spring Creek prison." He and another inmate had cut through a fence after learning that a section of the alarm system was out of service. I knew this was actually his second attempt. The first time, when Byran was in jail awaiting sentencing, he'd overpowered a guard, grabbed his gun, and threatened him with it. The trouble with that attempt: The gun wasn't loaded. Clearly, Byran wasn't only dangerous; he was desperate, too. I called my parents in tears, not knowing that by the time the newspaper went to print, he had already been found. \n Tanana River, near Fairbanks. (Photo: Alara Varnel/Flickr)     \nI felt safe after I left Alaska because Byran was locked away—not because I ever thought he would hurt me, but because I didn't have to think about him. I had trouble understanding, even after he murdered Johnny, how disturbed Byran was. Court records note that Byran told a friend at the time of the murder, "When I shot him and I saw the look on his face I've never been so happy in my life, but at the same time I was sick to my stomach." I held on to that last part at first, Byran feeling sick to his stomach, the part of him that I wanted to believe was the real Byran. Maybe he was not lost completely, not yet anyway. I didn't want to acknowledge what it meant that he might be able to feel both of those things at once. \n\nIt wasn't until I was forced to again think about the murder, after I saw Byran's name in that USA Today , that I began to understand why I had run away, and how different the response to tragedy had been in Fairbanks than it was in Fort Yukon. Fairbanks was a gold rush town that, in this case, seemed to be governed by its frontier, everyone-for-himself attitude. It didn't have the tribal connections, the sense of community you find in Alaska's villages. \n\nI think I'd always known that leaving Alaska would leave a trail of unanswered questions. I also knew I would one day have to at least try to sort them out. I didn't, though, until I couldn't ignore the silence anymore—until those questions started to crowd out other thoughts from my head. \nJohnny's mother embraced Byran's mother in the courtroom, saying, "Today, we've both lost sons." \nOr maybe the opposite is true: Maybe I was waiting for things in my life to get in order before trying to make sense of what happened in Fairbanks. I went to graduate school, I got married, I had children, I started teaching. Maybe the time was finally right. \n\nI had always planned to go back, but after moving to Maine for my husband's job, 16 years passed before I saw Alaska again. I've surrounded myself with pieces of home: split willow root baskets woven by the village grandma who cared for me when I was a baby; a wall-size map of Alaska in our living room; a near-nightly check for the Big Dipper, the constellation on the Alaska state flag. \n\nIn starting to write about Alaska, and the murder, I've been able to go home in other ways. I've reached out to people I had known, members of St. Matthew's in particular. I asked about Byran's parents—they still attend services there—and was discouraged from getting in touch with them. But I was given Byran's address at the state-run correctional facility in Seward, Alaska, the prison he'd escaped from in 1994. \n\nI didn't reach out to him right away. One night last spring, though, after an intense period of writing and thinking about the winter of 1989 and the way I left home, I dreamt vividly that I was hugging Byran, holding him. I woke up feeling gutted, totally empty, and crying, but also knowing exactly what I had to do. I described the dream in a short note to him the next day, not saying much else. \n\nHe wrote back immediately: "Shall we pick up where we left off?" \n\nI wish I could say that Byran's letters make sense to me, that there lay in those words an explanation of what happened, remorse for what he'd done. But what those letters do provide, it seems, is a way for him to be heard by the administrators where he's being held. His letters come sliced open and taped shut, with a "√" somewhere on the envelope to show that it's been read. Byran fills his letters with commentary about bureaucratic nonsense and processes, compliments about certain administrators, complaints about others (never by name). \n\nI give him sketches from my life, the view from my office window, the list of things I've done on a given day, things I expect will happen in the coming weeks. At first, we returned again to January, 1989, and Johnny, but it quickly became apparent to me that I was never going to be able to understand the depths of his mental illness, or what it truly means to be criminally insane. Byran was tried as an adult at 16 because it was determined that his chances of rehabilitation by age 20 were "slim." Knowing what I know now, based on his letters to me, I have to agree that rehabilitation, whatever that means, seems unlikely by any age. \n\nI nudged the conversation in other directions, away from Johnny, away from the murder. Byran didn't try to bring it back around. \n\nInstead, we talk now about our daily lives. "You'd be surprised to know," he wrote recently, "how busy it's possible to be in here." He has beautiful handwriting. He talks often about poetry; he wants me to remember that he was smart, that he still is. He almost always writes back right away. \n\nMy letters take longer. I search for words, wary about telling him too much, not wanting to put myself, or my family, at risk, even though I know his release date isn't until 2065. There is no parole eligibility listed in his records. People around me, my husband, those friends from Alaska who think I'm obsessed, expressed concern at first. But, I explain to them, I still think Byran is worthy of love. \n\nJohnny and I weren't close, but we would certainly be Facebook friends now, had he lived. He was the kind of guy who would have written on everyone's walls on their birthdays. He would have been a funny, loving dad, I imagine. \n\nByran didn't just kill Johnny; he silenced all of us, too. He made it hard to have faith in people. The ensuing hush around the murder reinforced the feeling that the world was not a safe place: If the grown-ups didn't know how to respond, how were we supposed to? I've talked about it with my own mother and father and other people who were parental figures at the time—church friends, former teachers. They all just shake their heads and say simply, "No one knew what to do." I don't blame them. The shock was deep. \n\nTalking about it, asking questions, trying to tell the story—despite the resistance I've met from other people who've also lived through it—has yielded unexpected gifts: I learned recently that when Byran was sentenced to life in prison, Johnny's mother embraced Byran's mother in the courtroom, saying, "Today, we've both lost sons." \n\nIt's that kind of truth I'm searching for, in my letters to Byran and in telling the story. Johnny's mother seems to have known that the only thing worse than losing your child is watching your child lose himself. She offered the compassion and the love that only she could offer. She is why I keep writing, even when I don't know what to say. \n     \nLead Photo :  Tanana River with ice fog . (Photo: frostnip/Flickr)

0211_4143d849-30fd-4589-89d5-3a5813c7a80b	Monarchs, Presidents and Prime Ministers will gather by the scores at United Nations Headquarters in New York on Monday for the General Assembly's annual General Debate, with a small island State that symbolizes the combat against climate change - an urgent threat to global sustainability - set to occupy the first seat. \n \nBy tradition, each year, the Secretary-General draws lots to select which among the UNs 193 Member States will occupy the first seat in the General Assembly Hall throughout the yearlong session, and this year Ban Ki-moon picked Tuvalu, a low-lying developing State of some 11,000 people in the South Pacific whose very existence is under dire threat from rising seas brought on by human-caused climate change. \n\nTackling climate change is one of the major objectives of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which the Assembly adopted on Friday. \n\nComposed of 17 goals and 169 targets, the Agenda is an essential plank in the effort to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and enhance medical and educational access over the next 15 years. \n\nUnchecked climate change could undermine all the other goals. \n\nAhead of this 70th anniversary General Debate, Ban will present his annual report on the work of the Organization. This years Assembly President, Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, will then deliver the keynote opening speech. \n\nHe will then be followed by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, whose country holds the traditional role of first national speaker. She will be followed by United States President Barak Obama as leader of the host nation. \n\nMany of the leaders have already participated in the three-day UN Sustainable Development Summit that launched the 2030 Agenda. \n\nThe new Agenda is people-centred, universal, transformative and integrated. It calls for action by all countries for all people over the next 15 years in five areas of critical importance: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. \n\nThe agenda recognizes that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with a plan that builds economic growth and addresses a range of social needs, while tackling climate change. \n\nThe Summit opened Friday with the film screening, The Earth from Space, followed by musical performances by UN Goodwill Ambassadors Shakira and Angelique Kidjo, as well as a call to action by Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai along with youth representatives as torch bearers to a sustainable future. \n\nOpening remarks were delivered by Yoweri Museveni, President of Uganda, Lars Lkke Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and civil society representative Salil Shetty, Amnesty International Secretary-General. \n\nPhoto: UN Photo/Cia Pak

0214_c69ce097-96b5-43b0-a5bb-9120c7b17dd1	The San Francisco 49ers depth chart remains the same thus far. It might be time to start considering some changes after a couple ugly losses. \nThe San Francisco 49ers PR department published their weekly game release as the team prepares to welcome the Green Bay Packers. The release includes a depth chart, created by the PR department. PR departments all across the league create depth charts for public consumption. The depth charts sometimes include feedback from members of the coaching staff, but really they're just more for discussion than deep insight. In this case, nothing has changed on it from Week 1.\n\nThat being said, this is mostly what the 49ers depth chart appears as right now. The "Acker OR Reaser" listing is not particularly accurate, considering Reaser only played defensive snaps for the first time this week. But for the most part, this is what it is.\n\nWith that in mind, what changes would you make to this group? You can look at this in one of two ways. On the one hand, you might think some changes can turn this thing around and get it back on track. On the other hand, you might be ready for the great re-build to begin, and thus think it is time to get young guys in the lineup.\n\nI am inclined to lean the latter given how the last two weeks have gone, but even some of those moves might get optimists going. Either way, the line needs some changes. Marcus Martin, Jordan Devey and Erik Pears have struggled mightily, so shaking that up would be a significant first step.\n\nIf Bruce Ellington can finally get healthy this week, I would have him as the clear third receiving option after Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith. No "OR" in the discussion. He is a potential playmaker, who can be used in a variety of roles. If the 49ers are going to figure out what these young guys can offer long-term, I'd like to see him in the mix more.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing Arik Armstead worked further and further into the gameplan. Tony Jerod-Eddie is a serviceable player, but he has always struck me as a valuable reserve tool. When a team is not good, rotational guys lose some of that luster. The value just isn't there.\n\nJim Tomsula talked about this offense being tight end focused. We've seen plenty of the tight ends. I am fine continuing to see how that develops, but I'd love to see more of Blake Bell sooner rather than later. I don't think Vernon Davis is going to be around next year, so figuring out what exactly this team has in that group would be helpful.\nQB: Colin Kaepernick, Blaine GabbertRB: Carlos Hyde, Reggie Bush, Jarryd Hayne, Mike DavisFB: Bruce MillerWR: Torrey Smith, DeAndrew WhiteWR: Anquan Boldin, Quinton Patton OR Bruce EllingtonLT: Joe StaleyLG: Alex Boone, Ian SilbermanC: Marcus Martin, Nick EastonRG: Jordan Devey, Brandon ThomasRT: Erik Pears, Trent BrownTE: Vernon Davis, Vance McDonald, Garrett Celek, Blake Bell\nLDT: Glenn Dorsey, Tony Jerod-Eddie, Arik ArmsteadNT: Ian Williams, Mike PurcellRDT: Quinton Dial, Tank CarradineOLB: Ahmad Brooks, Corey LemonierILB: NaVorro Bowman, Shayne SkovILB: Michael Wilhoite, Nick BelloreOLB: Aaron Lynch, Eli HaroldLCB: Tramaine Brock, Dontae JohnsonRCB: Kenneth Acker OR Keith Reaser, Shareece WrightFS: Eric Reid, Jimmie WardSS: Antoine Bethea, Jaquiski Tartt, L.J.

0215_2991129c-5a4c-4a81-9581-c8949adf9cc5	Ron “Boss” Everline keeps one major rule when he’s training his clients: no talking. Usually that’s an easy proposition when he’s keeping them busy with with reps on the bench press coupled with supersets of pushups and situps or snatching the air from their lungs with high intensity intervals . \n \nBut it’s tough to stop the chatter when your client is Kevin Hart. \n \n“Now Kevin is difficult, he’s always clowning around which is great for me,” said Everline, who’s been called “Boss” since his childhood after Dukes of Hazzar character Boss Hog. \n \n  \nBoss admits he rarely has been able to silence Hart during a workout unless the comedian is distracted by other work. But since Everline likes to train alongside his clients – which have included celebrities like Ne-Yo, Christian Milian and Trey Songz – he appreciates Hart’s infectious energy.  It also makes it that much easier to trash talk. Since Everline both travels and trains with Hart, they’ve made a habit of turning everything into a competition. \n \nEverline says that much of Hart’s routine focuses on core strength , not just building six-pack abs. But, for example, they might have a goal to hit 1000 pushups each day. The last person to complete the task will be punished, whether that means they’ll pay for dinner, the next round of gas or paying a $1,00 fine. \n \n  \n“It’s all about accountability,” Boss said. “It’s about making it fun.” \n \nWhen the duo started, Hart could push a 135-pound bench press. Now Everline said the “Get Hard” star can max out around 245 pounds. Hart’s been known for his boundless energy. Everline says that training kicks up a notch during movie \n \nEverline, who had NFL aspirations, played linebacker at Northwest Missouri. Before starting his personal training business. His first celebrity client was R&B singer Ne-Yo, who he worked with for three years before hooking up with Hart. Everline said he never actually sought out working with celebrities. Performance training was just a part of his lifestyle, a lifestyle he thought he could make a living sharing. \n \nNow if you follow Kevin Hart’s Instagram, you’ll see plenty of workout images and videos, some of which aso feature Boss. \n \n  \nHe’s joined Hart for multiple spontaneous 5K runs all over the country, including Chicago, San Francisco, Portland and Brooklyn, all as a means to help inspire people to get active and make health a priority. \n \n“That’s really the goal, to inspire the fitness community,” Everline said. “I’m inspired by him.

0218_b0cddee3-30f5-4931-8ccb-44de8cf1e75d	How I Heard About It:  As I was browsing for audio books at the public library, I came across this title and recognized the author's name.  I decided to give it a try now that I was heading back to work and needed a novel to listen to during my commute to and from school.  \nWhat It Is About:  This is not an easy novel to summarize.  There was so much that happened during the incredible story.  Joanna Mason was a young girl when her mother and two siblings were brutally murdered in a park near their home.  The killer was captured and put in prison.  Thirty some years later Joanna Hunter, now a doctor, is married and has her own child.  When she hears that the killer is going to be released from prison, she isn't quite sure how she feels about this situation.  Her nanny, Reggie, is involved in a train accident and saves the life of former detective Jackson Brodie.  Right before the crash, Brodie came across Andrew Decker.  Decker was the man that killed Joanna's family.  When Joanna disappears, Reggie becomes amateur detective (with the help of Brodie) to locate where she is and find out what happened to her.  All of their lives will collide in an explosive conclusion that will leave them all fighting for their lives. What I Thought Of It:  I was quite excited to listen to this story based on the positive reviews.  As the novel first started, I was a bit let down because it was a slow start and I was confused on all of the different characters and their stories.  I realized I was going to have to listen intently to follow this complex story.  Once I finished a few chapters, I was hooked.  The plot became fast-moving and the characters were interesting on their own, and extremely engaging as their lives began to cross paths.  The mystery of the disappearance of Joanna was frustrating at times because I wanted to know what truly happened, but had to listen for quite awhile to find out the answer.  Even though many horrible things happened during the story, it was a great story to listen to and kept me entertained for many commutes to and from work. Who Should Read It:  This is definitely an adult read.  Being my first Atkinson novel, I can see that she writes a complex and detailed fiction story.  I'm looking forward to trying another book by her in the near future.  If you are a mystery lover, then I know you will completely enjoy the story.  The setting takes place in England so this could be a draw for some readers.  There is definitely a British flavor to the story. Rating:  4 STARS out of 5 Stars

TAPING the show on Wednesday, Clinton asked Fallon if he'd ever touched Republican rival Donald Trump's hair before inviting him to touch her hair.\n\nFallon tugged her hair and declared it to be real.\n\nTrump spent the evening taking part in a Republican debate, but references to him dominated Clinton's appearance with Fallon.\n\nThe show began with Fallon wearing a wig, impersonating Trump in a sketch.\n\nClinton said if Trump became president, she imagined he might rename the White House as the Trump House.\n\nOn a serious note, Fallon asked what issue defines her campaign, and Clinton said raising Americans' income.
0220_cd72e42e-1199-45f3-ac3a-59cd0daa6c9c	Canberra Capitals coach Carrie Graf has confirmed a medical clearance is the only hurdle standing in the way of Abby Bishop re-signing for the upcoming WNBL season. \n\nThe Canberra Capitals have signed Australian Opals forward Abby Bishop after her hamstring injury prompted her European club to release her from her contract. Fairfax Media , and the Capitals were deep in negotiations to snap up their incumbent captain.\n\nOn Tuesday, scans confirmed her injury, which means the club can only play her on limited minutes.\n\nThe 26-year-old may miss games which involve long flights early on to avoid aggravating the problem.\n\nBishop attended training on Tuesday, where her teammates were informed of her signing, and the Capitals will make an official announcement on Wednesday.\n\nCapitals coach Carrie Graf said the lighter workload in the WNBL compared to Europe should ensure Bishop gets through the season unscathed.\n\n"Our season isn't like Europe where they have three games a week and practise twice a day, it's 24 games across five months," she said.\n\n"She's in a program where she can be well managed, we can reduce her minutes at practice."\n\nThe Capitals were reeling after the late withdrawals of Belgian centre Ann Wauters and point guard Kathleen Macleod, but have effectively improved their roster by luring Bishop and WNBA guard Renee Montgomery.\n\n"You're not just getting the MVP of the league [Bishop], we're getting one of our own players back that knows our program, plus a WNBA player of Renee Montgomery's ilk," Graf said.\n\n"Arguably those are two better recruits than the two we had, in terms of fit for our team and not having to adjust too much.\n\n"To be five weeks out from the season without a starting point guard or post was pretty damn scary, but sometimes out of adversity comes great things.\n\n"We may have some growing pains early but there's a sense when we add some bigs we can make a real splash in the league this year."\n\nMeanwhile, Graf said star Australian Opals centre Lauren Jackson is "tracking very well" in her rehabilitation from knee surgery and while there's no set time frame, expect her back on court early in the season.\n\nJackson has been training hard in a heat chamber and will form an outstanding post partnership with Bishop.\n\nThe Capitals won five of the six games Jackson played last year when she wasn't close to full fitness.\n\n"She's confident and feels really good about the knee, she's got the best base she's had in a couple of years and they're really confident the surgeries have got everything in the right place," Graf said.\n\n"She's doing conditioning in the heat chamber, and it'll be heat chamber minus oxygen next week.\n\n"It's about building her workload, what we don't want to do is bring her back too soon."\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0221_02002b92-f018-4cd8-8f52-f272e22c3190	Todd McCarthy couldn't think of a better to win the Sydney's drivers premiership than share it with his older brother Luke. At least that is what he says. Todd McCarthy couldn't think of a better way to win the Sydney drivers' premiership than share it with his older brother Luke. At least that is what he says. The 22-year-old came from a win behind at the final meeting of the season at Menangle to draw level but couldn't go past one of the blokes who taught him to drive.\n\n"I had some of the best blokes to teach [me] how to drive in dad, Luke and Andy," McCarthy said. "To share it with Luke was special and in a way made it better. But we are both very competitive and I wanted to beat him but it just didn't happen."\n\nMcCarthy, who drove 31 city winners for the season, is the new type of driver that brings an American style to Menangle.\n\n"I have watched a lot of American racing on the computer and with the big tracks over there it is something I have tried to do in my driving, leaning back like they do over there," McCarthy said. "This has easily been my biggest season and it is great to win the premiership."\n\nMcCarthy had chances to better his brother Luke after winning on Shannonsablast, he was runner-up in the feature of the night on Golden Montana, ran third in a three-way photo behind Monifieth but the final race looked his real opportunity.\n\nHe got to the front on $1.40 favourite Merrywood Ruby but was run down by Boundtobemad.\n\n"She is a nice filly but the other one was probably a little underrated," McCarthy said.\n\nBeautide for Inter Dominion\n\nJames Rattray confirmed two-time defending champion Beautide will be the star attraction of the Inter Dominion in Perth in November and December. Rattray went to Perth this week to have a look at facilities and complete the entry form 100 days from the series. He also had a couple of drives at Gloucester, steering home a winner in Pay Me Quick. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0222_0d13f8dc-78b4-4aba-8d13-7ecf17440fe6	Senator: Use military might to resolve conflicts, not make them \nBernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate on Wednesday to outline his support of the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal, likening its critics to those who backed the Iraq War in 2002. \n\nIn doing so, Sanders drew a sharp contrast with Hillary Clinton, who earlier Wednesday made her own case for supporting the deal. \n\n"Those who have spoken out against the Iran agreement, including many in this chamber, and those who have made every effort to thwart the diplomatic process, are many of the same people who spoke out forcefully and irresponsibly about the need to go to war with Iraq, one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of our country," Sanders said. \n\nSanders did not mention his vote against the war in 2002, but he has frequently cited his early opposition to the bill that authorized military force, and, like other Democratic candidates, has used the issue to highlight differences between him and Clinton. \n\nIn the speech, Sanders characterized the GOP as war-mongering. \n\n"I fear that many of my Republican colleagues don't fully understand that war must be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war. It is not so easy to fully comprehend the unintended consequences of that war," Sanders said. "Yes, the military option should always be on the table, but it should be the last option." \n\nSanders' remarks came hours after Clinton delivered a forceful yet cautious backing of the Iran nuclear deal in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, saying it helps protect Israel and pledging that, if elected, she would strengthen the security bond between the Jewish state and the U.S. \n\nThe Senate is currently debating a resolution to disapprove of the administration's agreement. Forty-two Democratic members of the Senate have come out in favor of the deal, giving President Barack Obama enough votes to prevent a likely GOP-led resolution disapproving of the deal. \n\n"It is my firm belief that the test of a great nation with the most powerful military on earth is not how many wars it can engage in, but how it can use our strength and our capabilities to resolve international conflicts in a peaceful way," Sanders said. "I believe it is incumbent upon us to give the negotiated agreement the chance to succeed." \n\nClinton's vote to authorize the war in Iraq has nagged her political career for years, most notably during her 2008 bid for president, when then-Sen. Barack Obama, who publicly opposed the war, cited Clinton's support to claim he was better suited to lead on foreign policy. \n\nClinton has since said her Iraq War vote was a "mistake."
0223_36670c3a-806d-4084-8e52-a8237151239b	MOREHEAD, Ky. (BP) — A Kentucky county clerk not only lost at the U.S. Supreme Court Monday evening (Aug. 31) but now faces a likely contempt of court ruling for again refusing to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \n \nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis and her deputies turned away gay couples seeking marriage licenses Tuesday morning (Sept. 1) at their office in the eastern Kentucky town of Morehead. Their refusal came after the high court denied Davis' request to block enforcement of a federal judge's order that she issue licenses for same-sex marriages. \n \nLawyers for the gay couples subsequently filed a contempt of court motion against Davis, The Louisville Courier-Journal reported. David Bunning, the federal judge who previously ordered Davis to issue licenses, will consider Thursday the request she be held in contempt, according to the newspaper. \n \nThe Supreme Court's denial of Davis' application for a stay of the order came two months after the justices legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. That 5-4 ruling June 26 prompted some country clerks to resign their jobs rather than issue licenses to gay couples. Davis stopped issuing all marriage licenses and has refused to resign, appealing for an accommodation of her religious beliefs in order for her to keep her job. \n \nAmerican history "is filled with accommodations for people's religious freedom and conscience," Davis said Sept. 1 in a statement issued by Liberty Counsel, a religious freedom advocacy organization that represents her. "I want to continue to perform my duties, but I also am requesting what our Founders envisioned — that conscience and religious freedom would be protected." \n \nPaul Chitwood, executive director of the Kentucky Baptist Convention, found the Supreme Court's decision unsurprising, since the same justices ruled in favor of same-sex marriage. "This case is just another step along the sad road where erotic liberty trumps religious liberty in the United States," he told Baptist Press in written comments. \n \n"This can't be an easy stand for Mrs. Davis to take," Chitwood said. "The criticism is sharp, and the potential for fines and even jail time is very real. No matter how this plays out, we can all agree she's facing an unenviable situation, and Christians across this country need to be praying for her." \n \nTom James, president of the Kentucky Baptist Convention, told BP he supports Davis. \n \n"To issue the license would not only violate her conscience but also her protection under the First Amendment of our Constitution, which provides for the free exercise of religion," said James, pastor of Eastwood Baptist Church in Bowling Green, in a written statement. "Christianity is not something a person can stop practicing when they go to work or school; our relationship with Christ should be marked by deeply held convictions that permeate all of who we are. \n \n"We as a society are moving towards removing all of God's standards and to silence all of God's children who seek to speak light and truth in a society that is becoming darker by the minute," he said. \n \nRussell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, called it "a sad development." \n \nHe told BP the government "ought to provide its employees with all protections possible to the furtherance of maintaining public order." \n \n"There are better solutions available than the one in Kentucky that needlessly pits the rule of law against freedom of conscience," Moore said in written comments. "The governor and legislature of Kentucky could act to accommodate county clerks whose consciences object to issuing same-sex marriage licenses while still maintaining the rule of law." \n \nThe Supreme Court opinion in June did not rule out accommodations for the conscience rights of religious Americans, Liberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver said Aug. 31 before the high court issued its denial. \n \n"Providing religious conviction accommodations is not antithetical for public employees," Staver said in a written release. "Throughout our history the courts have accommodated people's deeply held religious beliefs." \n \nAmong the accommodations suggested to the Supreme Court, Staver said, were removing Davis' name from marriage licenses and permitting the county's chief executive to issue licenses. \n \nDavid Moore and David Ermold were among the same-sex couples whose requests for marriage licenses were rejected by Davis' office Sept. 1. \n \n"Who has to go through this to get married? This is 2015. This is America. This is what we pay taxes for — to be treated like this. To be discriminated against," Moore told Davis, according to The Courier-Journal. \n \nWhen asked under whose authority she was refusing to issue licenses, Davis said, "Under God's authority." \n \nIn her statement issued by Liberty Counsel, Davis said, "To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God's definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. \n \n"To me this has never been a gay or lesbian issue. It is about marriage and God's Word. It is a matter of religious liberty," said Davis, who served as a deputy clerk for 27 years before winning election last year as county clerk. \n \nSteven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said in a written statement, "The duty of public officials is to enforce the law, not place themselves above it." The ACLU and ACLU of Kentucky filed the contempt motions with Bunning. \n \nDavis has appealed Bunning's order to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, but a court delay preventing enforcement of the order expired Aug. 31. \n \nShe has sued Gov. Steve Beshear for ordering the state's county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \n \nNot a subscriber?

0225_0ddd2601-4bc3-4e12-b60f-6b998afca3a3	It was August 1974 and U.S. president Richard Nixon — implicated in the Watergate coverup after a politically motivated break in — had just resigned in disgrce. \n \n\n                            "I am not a crook!" he pronounced defiantly, then reconsidered, flashed a peace sign and fled from office. \n \n\n                            Inspired by this real life political crisis — with its air of subterfuge and deceit — my siblings and I came to the paranoid conclusion that we could no longer trust each oter. \n \n\n                            "I'm telling you, Mom, someone has been in my room!" I would pronounce when I discovered a MAD magazine with a bent corner or record cover with a thumbprint. \n \n\n                            "THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!" \n \n\n                            "How do you know anyone was in there?" she would ask, annoyed by these thundering accusations from a 14-year old. \n \n\n                            I would slam my fist on the table for emphasis: "Because I can see footprints in the shag carpet!'' \n \n\n                            This, generally, would end the conversation, as she retreated to another room while I continued to eye my four younger siblings through a lens of dark suspicion. \n \n\n                            And then my brother Arnold, 12 — determined to fight fire with fire — trotted off to Radio Shack for a do-it-yourself security system that set off an alarm bell every time an intruder tripped a hidden wre. \n \n\n                            The next time I snuck in to check out his Kiss records and "Welcome Back Kotter" action figures — BUSTE! \n \n\n                            Equally inspired, Glenn, 10, would place a glass of water on top of his door frame to drench unwanted visitors, while Trevor, eight, simply tacked a piece of cardboard with the crude warning "KEEP OUT!" in jagged letters on his door. \n \n\n                            Only Susan, a sweet trusting six-year-old, was in the dark, blithely unaware her four older brothers would sneak into her room to eat the powdered cake mix from her Easy Bake oven and help ourselves to whatever coins we found in her piggy bank. \n \n\n                            And so we lived, eyeing each other warily, snooping through each other's possessions while guarding our own like prison screws at Sing Sing. \n \n\n                            Confrontations, naturally, were inevitable. \n \n\n                            "Why were you snooping in my room?' \n \n\n                            "Who me?" \n \n\n                            "Yes, you. I hooked up my camera to the heat sensor on my science kit. Here's an infrared image of your hand on my hockey card collection. Please explain.'' \n \n\n                            When I look back today, I have to laugh, because the only thing any of us owned of any value was our prized, state-of-the-art stereo systems. \n \n\n                            Five kids, five stereos. It makes sense, right? \n \n\n                            This was 1974, after all — the golden age of shlock rock. Every kid needed their own stereo to play Grand Funk's "Loco-Motion" and Terry Jacks' "Seasons in the Sun" \n \n\n                            I should point out that, as a one income family with five kids, we weren't rich, feasting on tins of clammy Chef Boyardee ravioli while watching "The Brady Bunch" on our crappy 12-inch black and white. \n \n\n                            But lo and behold, there were those stereos — Technics turntables, Sanyo eight-tracks, JBL speakers the size of refrigerators — purchased with money from snow shovelling, grass cutting, paper routes and birthday gifts from anonymous great auts. \n \n\n                            "That's the dumbest thing I ever heard," noted my wife when I recalled the deafening sound of five amplifiers turned to 11 under one roof. \n \n\n                            "Who has five stereos in one house? Who cares if someone went in your room? Were you all insane?"' \n \n\n                            "You don't understand," I fired back, glancing nervously over my shoulder. "I was the oldest. I had the best stuff. Nothing was secure." \n \n\n                            You would think we could joke about it today at family gatherings, having matured, mellowed, moved on with our lives. \n \n\n                            But when I recently asked my sibs to reflect back on our comical obsessions with secrecy and seclusion, the old paranoia returned. \n \n\n                            "You want a piece of me?" muttered Arnold, sounding like George Costanza's father on Seinfeld. "YOU GOT IT!" \n \n\n                            I have to admit, it's a rather odd family. \n \n\n                            While our peers were getting wasted at beer blasts and smoking dope in carpeted basements — or was that on "That 70s Show?" — we were at home, guarding our stereos with a stealth and determination more suited for careers as CIA operaties. \n \n\n                            There was, of course, an upside. \n \n\n                            This single-minded intensity devoted to in-home security not only kept us out of trouble, it was later put to good use earning university degrees and raising families who, I suspect, will one day guard their own bedrooms with the same unbridled zeal. \n \n\n                            "Hey Max," I called the other day to my Pokemon obsessed seven-year-old. "Want me to show you how to adjust your bedroom door so no one can sneak in and mess up your stuff?'' \n \n\n                            Max looks puzzled. \n \n\n                            "But Dad, you told us family was more important than material possessions." \n \n\n                            "Did I say that? I must have been drunk. Family is important, but that Pokemon card collection under your bed? That's something worth fighting for." \n \n\n                            Grabbing the carpet rake, I show him how to arrange the fibres in a pattern that will instantly capture the footprint of anyone who enters without permission. \n \n\n                            "What are you doing?" interrupts Alicia, barging in with a basket of laundry. "Turning our kids into dysfunctional control freaks? Isn't one generation enough?" \n \n\n                            I smile weakly. "Don't blame me," I protest, setting a glass of water on top of the door frame. "Blame Richard Nixon."

Collins, L. Coltman, J. Lentjes, T. Walden, P. Breen, J. Renton, J. Spence, M. Faddes tries; Breen 6 cons, 2 pens, dg) \nSouthland 7 (W. Halaholo try, L.

0228_a419ac1e-a1a2-4632-8235-48c71acf6b5c	The on-demand viewing habits of Millennials will not revert to the steady linear patterns of their parents as they grow up, according to YouTube's director content strategy, Jamie Byrne. The on-demand viewing habits of Millennials will never revert to the steady linear patterns of their parents when they grow up, according to YouTube's director content strategy, Jamie Byrne. In an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media, Mr Byrne also dismissed suggestions that YouTube risked becoming a farm system that fostered the next generation of stars only to see them stolen by the likes of Netflix and the Hollywood studios.\n\nYouTube says its reaches more people in the United States than any cable network among ages 18 to 49, the group most sought after by advertisers.\n\nAnd Mr Byrne, who has been with the video platform since 2006 – just before it was acquired by Google for a prescient $US1.65 billion – predicted it would keep viewers as they moved higher into that age range.\n\n"I find it hard to believe that if you have grown up in a world where you choose what you want to watch, you're not locked into anyone's linear programming schedule and can set your own schedule across any device, that you are going to switch back to something that gives you less control," he said. Billboard promotion\n\nAs part of its push to grab more advertising dollars from television, YouTube has bought space on prominent billboards along Sunset Boulevard to promote its growing roster of "creators" such as Tyler Oakley, Lilly Singh, Michelle Phan and Bethany Mota.\n\nThese stars have lured millions of millennial viewers – and some big-name sponsors – to their channels, which feature content from Oakley's interview with Michelle Obama to Singh's observational comedy skits via Phan and Mota's popular beauty tips. YouTube takes 45 per cent of advertising sold against the videos.\n\n"The creators are becoming moguls or media businesses in their own right and you will see them start to extend into other places like The New York Times bestseller lists and movies," Mr Byrne said.\n\nBut he insisted the most savvy YouTube stars would stay loyal to the platform amid increasing attempts by other media to poach them. "The creators tell us that no matter what else they do, they want to stay here. This is the platform that helps them get on the bestseller list, sell their movie and distribute their content to other players, which is fine, that's how the media business works." Disruptive threats\n\nBut YouTube itself faces disruptive threats in free on-demand video content with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat and Vine all competing aggressively for eyeballs.\n\nMr Byrne shrugged it off.\n\n"One company cannot build an entire industry on its own so it's expected," he said. "It's a good validation of what we've been doing but it also means there's other people in the marketplace that are going to help advertisers to move over to video as a platform and that's kind of needed in many respects.\n\n"We need advertisers to recognise the power of video and the power of these influencers and start moving more of their budgets into our space. As that happens, creators make more money, they can invest more money in content and the whole industry should rise."\n\nYouTube's content push is about to be stepped up with the arrival of ex-MTV programming chief Susanne Daniels, who will oversee development and production of content. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

S. to accept 10, 000 Syrian refugees: White House Categories: Banking Fraud Cognitive Dissonance Constitution CURRENCY COLLASPE DYSFUNCTIONAL EDUCATION Executive Orders GLOBAL GOVERNANCE Government corruption IMMIGRATION INTERNATIONAL BANKING CARTEL ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT Totalitarianism Treason U.S. Military UNITED NATIONS War Saturday, September 12th, 2015 by olddog http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/10/us-europe-migrants -whitehouse-idUSKCN0RA26220150910 U.S. President Barack Obama waves as he walks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington before their departure September 9, 2015. REUTERS/YURI GRIPAS   BY JULIA EDWARDS   President Barack Obama has directed his administration to prepare to take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year, the White House said on Thursday. It is the first specific commitment the United States has made toward increasing its acceptance of refugees from the war-torn country. Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the United States has taken in 1,500 refugees, with 300 more expected to be cleared by October. But refugee advocates and some members of Congress said taking in an additional 10,000 refugees did not go far enough toward addressing the humanitarian crisis triggered by the war, which has prompted a massive refugee influx into Europe. In a letter distributed to House members and seen by Reuters, Democratic Representative David Cicilline asked Obama to accommodate 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016. Religious groups have called for the United States to accept 100,000 Syrian refugees. European countries have taken in waves of migrants fleeing violence. Germany allowed 20,000 migrants into the country over the weekend and is preparing for 800,000 this year. Melanie Nezer, vice president of HIAS, a global refugee advocacy group, said that for the United States to allow 10,000 more refugees from Syria was not an adequate response to the crisis. RELATED COVERAGE › White House says U.S. security top concern regarding refugees “This is totally within the realm of what the current system on autopilot could do. This is not time for autopilot. This is time to really ramp things up,” said Nezer. The United States is conducting air strikes in Syria as part of its effort to fight against Islamic State. It currently admits a total of 70,000 refugees from around the world annually, and is due to increase that total by 5,000 for the fiscal year starting in October. White House spokesman Josh Earnest would not say whether the 10,000 Syrians would be a part of or in addition to that total. SECURITY CONCERNS Earnest said national security was a top concern for admitting Syrians, a country rife with anti-American militants, noting that intensive security screening for refugees could take up to 18 months. “I do feel confident in telling you that the president will not sign off on a process that cuts corners when it comes to the basic safety and security of the American people and the U.S. homeland,” Earnest told reporters. The additional background checks and processing will require a “significant financial commitment” from Congress, Earnest said. Secretary of State John Kerry met with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, a requirement before the administration can change the number of refugees allowed. Committee Chair Chuck Grassley said he welcomed the additional 10,000 but that Kerry was not clear about whether additional refugees would be allowed later. “Secretary Kerry initially said that the Obama administration is seeking a reasonable increase in refugees allowed into the United States in the upcoming fiscal year. But when pressed, the administration indicated that they were considering opening the floodgates and using emergency authority to go above what they proposed to Congress in today’s consultation,” the Republican lawmaker said in a statement. Congress cannot block the administration from setting limits on the number of refugees it admits from each region. But it can block funding needed for staffing agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services that handle the screening and resettlement procedures.   (Reporting by Julia Edwards; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Richard Cowan andLisa Lambert; Editing by Bernard Orr, Peter Cooney and Ken Wills)   Both comments and pings are currently closed.

And with that comes a large security risk.\n\n"We are monitoring very closely threats against the Pope as he comes in to the United States. We have disrupted one case in particular.\n\n"But as that date approaches, I think we're all very ... vigilant to protect him as he comes into the United States."\n\nAuthorities have been preparing for the security challenge of Pope Francis' visit between 22 September and 27 September.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has said the visit will be a National Special Security Event - meaning the Secret Service will head the planning of security.\n\nThe pontiff will get a plane-side greeting from President Barack Obama in Washington DC on 22 September, before becoming the third pope to visit the White House.\n\nHe is due to give a speech to the Senate and House of Representatives, address world leaders at the United Nations, preside over a service at the 9/11 memorial in New York and celebrate Mass at Madison Square Garden, among other events.\n\nNew York officials announced last week a series of new security measures ahead of the visit, including airspace restrictions, screening checkpoints and a ban on balloons, selfie sticks and backpacks at papal events.\n\nIn March, the inspector general of the Vatican's police force, Domenico Giani, told Polizia Moderna magazine that Islamic State militants could pose a threat to Pope Francis during the visit to the US.
0234_23bec493-df77-4230-83ed-32110dc914df	Petersburg area farmer Kurt Collins stripped the first reported bale of 2015-crop cotton in Hale County on Monday, with it being ginned about 3 p.m. Tuesday at Petersburg Co-op Gin. \n  \nCollins grew the dryland crop about a mile west of FM 789 on the north side of FM 784, producing four modules and 40 to 45 bales of cotton. Yield was approximately one bale, or about 500 pounds of fiber, to the acre. \n \nHe planted Fibermax 1830 in mid-May, and used a defoliant to prepare the crop for harvest. \n \n“We prepped it and then waited two weeks before harvest,” he reported. \n \nCollins, 39, started farming in 2004 and is completing his 11th crop. \n \nHe and his wife, Tammi, have been married 11 years and are farming partners. \n \n“I was born and raised in Petersburg, and never left,” he explained Tuesday.

0236_e2043241-c5b3-4866-af79-2bd338b25a6c	Recently, Hillary Clinton and others in her party have found it convenient to compare the GOP to “terrorist groups” on the issue of women’s health. They have emphasized that the GOP’s beliefs and behaviors are not what one would expect to see in a truly modern society. We know these “terrorist groups,” such as ISIS, to have a medieval mentality. We know them as a group prone to brutalizing their victims in many ways, including maiming, dismemberment, beheadings, burnings and crucifixions. We know them to murder without reservation the defenseless elderly, women and children. In a modern society, we would not do such things. In a modern society, we would step forth to put an end to such atrocities, and we would defend those who are most defenseless and most easily victimized. Yet Hillary and like-minded people are quick to condemn the GOP for its stance against abortion, which includes the maiming, dismemberment and dissection of unborn children. And they do this in the name of women’s health rights. The health rights of the children are not their concern. This is their vision of our modern society. Perhaps we should take pause and think more deeply about who are really the ones with the Dark Ages barbarian mentality.   Kevin Finson Washington

But when you cut overall the rate of inheritance tax, that means the very richest become richer.’ \n\nIn his Budget this year, Chancellor George Osborne raised the 40 per cent inheritance tax threshold for families from its current level of £650,000 to £1million from April 2020. \n\nMillions of families will be able to avoid the tax altogether when passing on their home to their children or grandchildren, with only 6 per cent of families having to pay the tax. \n\nLabour was unable to give details of how its new policy would work. But Mr Corbyn’s comments suggest any relief felt by ordinary families will be short-lived if Labour seizes power. \n\nAt the Labour Conference in Brighton today, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will signal plans for a huge tax raid on middle-class families as he calls for a radical redistribution of wealth in Britain. \n\nThe devoted Marxist will use his first major speech as Labour’s economic spokesman to call for a ‘new economics’ in which wealth is ‘shared more equally among all sections of our country’. \n\nMr McDonnell will also confirm plans to order the Bank of England to print tens of billions of pounds of new money to fund a spending spree if Labour is elected. \n\nThis comes despite a warning from a former financial watchdog today that the move represents a ‘huge risk’ to the economy. \n \nThe Shadow Chancellor has already called for a 7p rise in national insurance contributions for those earning more than £50,000 a year. \n\nYesterday, he appointed a team of Left-wing economists to advise him on policy, including controversial French author Thomas Piketty, who has called for the introduction of an 80 per cent top tax rate. \n\nMr Corbyn said Labour would move in this direction by reintroducing the 50p top tax rate, and the party would raise corporation tax and axe the welfare cap that limits the benefits families receive. \n   \nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell has already called for a 7p rise in national insurance contributions for those earning more than £50,000 a year and has a team of Left-wing economists to advise him on policy \n\nLabour sources said proposals previously outlined by Mr McDonnell would form the basis of a major policy review designed to incorporate the views of the thousands of Left-wing activists who propelled Mr Corbyn into power. \n\nWhile the Shadow Chancellor will talk of the need to tackle the huge deficit left behind by the last Labour government, his plans will leave him free to go on an unfunded spending spree running into tens of billions of pounds a year. Mr Osborne warned that Labour’s plans would create a £218billion black hole, potentially leading to punishing tax rises for the middle classes. \n\nThe Chancellor said: ‘The Labour Party’s plans to nationalise great swathes of our economy and abolish the welfare cap would cost billions, and now we know the money they say they would raise simply doesn’t exist. \n\n‘That means they would carry on borrowing, risking higher mortgage rates and burdening our children with more debt than they could ever hope to repay. This isn’t an economic policy so much as a recipe for disaster for Britain and your family.’ \n\nThe Tories claim that raising the £218billion would cost more than £12,000 in extra taxes or borrowing for every working household. \n\nThey calculate that renationalising energy firms would cost £185billion, taking the Royal Mail back into public ownership would cost £4.3billion and nationalising the railways comes with a £10billion price tag. \n   \nDeputy leader Tom Watson (pictured with Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour Conference in Brighton) acknowledged Labour was ‘unashamedly anti-austerity’ as Labour announced a spending spree if the party is elected \n\nReversing welfare changes announced by Mr Osborne in the Budget would cost £12billion, while scrapping tuition fees would leave a £7.1billion bill, the Tories added. \n\nLabour dismissed the claims as ‘total rubbish’. \n\nDeputy leader Tom Watson, who acknowledged Labour was ‘unashamedly anti-austerity’, said: ‘We reject the Tory narrative that says capping benefits, closing Sure Start centres, cutting tax credits for millions is the right way to get the economy on track. We will oppose that.’ \n\nHowever, Chris Leslie, Mr McDonnell’s predecessor, suggested Labour’s stance would alienate voters. \n\nHe urged the leadership to ‘tone down aggressive rhetoric’ aimed at business and the better-off, and called for greater clarity on how Labour would balance the books. \n\nAdair Turner, former head of the Financial Services Authority, will today warn about the dangers of Mr Corbyn’s plan for ‘people’s quantitative easing’ – printing billions of pounds to fund investment, fearing that Labour would use it ‘to excess’. \n\nLast night, Mr McDonnell said his speech today would not be ‘one of my normal rants’ but would take in the need to make tax collection more effective, and discuss whether to introduce a financial-transaction tax on the City – a so-called Robin Hood Tax. \n JEREMY CORBYN 'LOATHSOME' ON THE IRA, SAYS LORD TEBBIT      \nJeremy Corbyn faced a growing row yesterday after he confirmed he still believes in a united Ireland \n\nJeremy Corbyn was facing a growing row yesterday after he confirmed he still believes in a united Ireland. \n\nMr Corbyn, who sparked outrage in the 1980s and 90s for hosting Republicans in Parliament at the height of IRA terrorism, backed the idea of ‘one island of Ireland’ in an interview. \n\nHis views will set him on another collision course with Unionists at a tense time in the province, as well as his own party. \n\nSpeaking on the first day of Labour’s conference in Brighton, yards from Grand Hotel which was bombed by the IRA in 1984 killing five people, he defended his meetings with Sinn Fein leaders weeks afterwards claiming they helped the peace process. Asked if he still backed a united Ireland, he said: ‘It’s for the Irish people to decide,’ adding that his view was ‘very much on the record’. \n\nLast night former Tory minister Lord Tebbit, whose wife was paralysed in the Brighton bomb said: ‘Jeremy Corbyn is entirely and completely wrong. It is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide and they voted to stay within the United Kingdom. The ceasefire was not down to him, it was because the IRA were defeated and wanted to save their skins. \n\n‘I regard him as loathsome and contemptible.’
0239_082ca19b-ca67-4d51-9854-233fc037e553	Arab Spring has predictably been an utter disaster. \n \nBy undermining the legitimacy of existing authority, it has turned the middle east into a sea of blood and fire, the worst cases being Syria and Libya. \n \nMiddle Easterners are mostly of inferior races, and at the best of times, it is hard for them to maintain the basic functions of a modern society, hard to keep the electricity running, the water running, the sewage off the streets, and all that.  To operate this quite ordinary stuff in a society dominated by an inferior race requires a fair bit of arrogant confident elitism and a cheerful willingness to smack grossly inferior people around to keep them from mischief.  Arab Spring has been democratic and anti elitist.  Thus most of the anti Bashar Assad groups in Syria just cannot keep that stuff functioning, and keep begging the horrid evil tyrant Bashar Assad to keep that stuff operating for them. \n \nNear as I can figure, the major reasons that Bashar Assad is a horrible tyrant is that he stops stupid people from doing stupid things and he will not let them rape and murder those of non Muslim minorities. \n \nOddly, Obama and the Cathedral press have unshaken confidence that Obama is on the correct side of history.  From time to time they confidently predict that Putin will fail unless he overthrows Bashar Assad for the Cathedral, after many years of disastrous failure by the Cathedral in its efforts to overthrow Bashar Assad. \n \nObama and the New York Times and the rest live in an echo chamber, utterly impervious to outside reality.  Their policy cannot be a disaster, because they are on the right side of history. \n \nThe natural outcome of democracy is that each tribe votes for  its tribal interest.  The result is unacceptable to all the minority tribes.  War ensues, unless the majority group has a natural advantage in military struggle as well as voting, unless the majority group is the clearly superior group.  If you have democracy without war, it is because you have an ethnically homogeneous society, or someone is rigging the system to produce acceptable results. \n \nBashar Assad’s strength is that his religion is the only religion in Syria, other than Christianity, that is tolerant enough that it can be trusted to refrain from massacring minorities and his political organization is the only one that has the basic competence to keep the basic services of a modern society functioning and the will to keep the hands of subhumans off those basic services. \n \nThe Cathedral congratulates itself that it is rule by smart superior people, but rule by smart superior people was an unprincipled exception, which exception has now been rolled back . \n \nThe effects of rule by stupid people are most immediately apparent at your DMV department, at your airport security screening, and in Syria. \n \nIf you are not getting Syrian style brownouts, the people who are keeping our power system functioning, the people who making sure you do not get brownouts, are all rather old and due to retire soon.  Soon your power supply will be provided by the same people who operate airport security, because right now, white male privilege keeps the power on, and that is an unprincipled exception.
0240_f5f50171-18d8-4ede-96ec-5686bd3d461e	Happy Force Friday eve!  I am curious how many of our readers are going to venture out to check out the new line of toys for Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens?  My kids would be disappointed in me if I didn't brave the midnight scene and try to get my grubby hands on a First Order Stormtrooper, Rey, Kylo Ren, and BB-8 to name a few.  Hopefully my wife won't be upset with the newest wave of Funko Pop!s,  Hot Wheels, Legos, and action figures.  At least my kids will be happy.  Check out the official guide here and let me know in the comments if you plan on going.\nPick of the Week:\nPlutonia #1 - If it is from Image and has the name Jeff Lemire attached to it you can guarantee it will be something worth reading.  The creative team of Lemire, Emi Lenox, and Jordie Ballaire gave us the gift of Plutonia this week.  It has a very Stand By Me vibe, which is a good thing, and includes an interesting mix of young characters.  You have your bully from an abusive home, the sister who has her plans ruined by her little brother, the overweight friend who has self-esteem issues, and a self-proclaimed capespotter.  What?  Capespotters are a group of individuals who are fans of superheroes and devote their time to logging sightings of them on the internet.  Seems like a pretty typical day for these teens, but that all changes when they stumble upon Plutonia's dead body.  I think my favorite part of the book is the short story drawn by Lemire that begins to document the final day of Plutonia.  It will be interesting to see how this mystery unfolds and I am looking forward to the emotional journey Lemire will bring us on through the lenses of these children.\nThe Rest:\nDaredevil #18 - This was a bittersweet issue, as we have to bid a fond adieu to Mark Waid.  Waid enjoyed the longest run of Daredevil and it was what brought me back to the Man with No Fear.  While Charles Soule, who is taking the reigns, is no slouch, he has big shoes to fill.  Waid brought Daredevil to the West Coast and wrapped things up by punching Kingpin in the face repeatedly.  I am curious what the future holds for Mr. Waid and am looking for his next project.  Congratulations on an incredible run.\nDeadpool vs. Thanos #1 -When I saw this title, there was little I could do to avoid picking it up.  The  premise was intriguing, and it actually taught me something about Deadpool.  I have enjoyed some Deadpool comics in the past, but by no means am a big fan.  This book informed me that it was the mad titan himself, Thanos, who cursed Wade Wilson!  I enjoyed that tidbit and the basic premise that Lady Death has been kidnapped and it is up to unlikely heroes to save her.  I am strangely looking forward to the next issue.\nPOSTED BY MIKE N. aka Victor Domashev -- comic guy, proudly raising nerdy kids, and Nerds of a Feather contributor since 2012.
0241_48f1e494-6ebd-409d-bb25-23d09fbcbbd8	In the heat of the 2016 presidential race, Vice President Joe Biden has expressed interest in a possible candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Biden has not yet made a decision whether to run or not, but increasing support for the vice president show that he will clearly be throwing his hat into the ring. \n(Natalie Goldstein / Daily Titan) \n \nWhen Joe Biden marched arm in arm with thousands of union employees on Monday at a Pittsburgh Labor Day parade, the crowd chanted, “Run, Joe, run!” All this publicity for a candidate who is still not sure if he’s going to run for president. \n \nUnlike GOP candidates Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Donald Trump, who are recognized as operating heavily “outside the beltway,” the current vice president is a world-class politician who knows how to use his rhetoric and the current political climate to gain a political advantage—which means he can manipulate the media and the public to achieve his objectives. His widely publicized head-scratching routine surrounding his upcoming candidacy for the 2016 presidential election seems dicey at best. \n \nHillary Clinton’s widely publicized foul-ups, like her email scandal, continue to weaken her appeal. Coupled with the apprehension moderate liberals may have for aligning themselves with a devout “democratic socialist” like Bernie Sanders, Biden has an untapped market of perplexed liberal voters to target. \n \nBiden commands the loyalty of the current commander-in-chief, appeals to moderate liberals and has been hailed by corporate big dogs like News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Wall Street billionaire Jim Chanos for having a great chance of beating Clinton in the primary election. \n \nAn added bonus is that Biden fits snuggly within a political safe-haven, as the Democratic front-runner Clinton will not publicly challenge her co-worker and force President Obama to defend the current VP in public. \n \nThe stage is clearly set for Biden, but why he won’t throw his hat in the ring yet leaves voters wondering. \n \n“The most relevant factor in my decision is whether my family and I have the emotional energy to run,” he said to a packed crowd in Atlanta on Sept. 3–understandable in light of the tragic death of his son Beau Biden, who lost his battle to brain cancer in May. \n \nBiden’s team has set a respective deadline from Sept. 1 to Oct. 1 for the 72-year-old to make a decision regarding his campaign, according to U.S. News & World Report. But he’s clearly running and won’t admit to it. \n \nIt’s not very presidential to leave a solution-minded public in the dark about your intentions. Historically, Democrats are nothing if not predictable, even when they are trying not to be. \n \nThis tactic of Biden’s is another example of the subtle duplicity American voters are just tired of bearing witness to, this reporter included.
0242_07f08ea8-43e7-4e70-87af-1ccb7d078e98	Just wondering about some forgotten stories...\n.. about the important hunt for the non-Islamic African terrorist Joseph Kony.  Some may recall Obama sending several hundred American troops to help bring him to justice a number of years ago.  Not much news since, but the WaPo has just released an update..\nAs their mission stretches into a fifth year, however, U.S. troops have turned to some unsavory partners to help find Kony’s trail. Working from a new bush camp in the Central African Republic, U.S. forces have begun working closely with Muslim rebels — known as Seleka — who toppled the central government two years ago and triggered a still-raging sectarian war with a campaign of mass rapes and executions. The Pentagon had not previously disclosed that it is cooperating with Seleka and obtaining intelligence from the rebels. The arrangement has made some U.S. troops uncomfortable. Wonder if those Muslim "rebels" are actually Muslims, or are they non-Muslims like ISIS?  Or are non-Muslims like ISIS the ones Obama was talking about when he said non-Muslims should not condemn Islam due to Islamic terrorism, or was he talking about Christians?  And is Joseph Kony a Christian terrorist or just someone who is perverting Christianity?   Confusing.  ...and in another story, what about Obama's favorite general, Hoss Cartwright?  A few years ago he made news when he became a target of a US Attorney-led investigation of a leak of top secret information to the press on Iran.  Last word was that it was 'stalled' due to concerns over the Iran deal.   Well, it's done now, so what's going on?   Remember, David Petraeus was prosecuted for leaking in less time.  And he's not the only one.     Oh well, maybe CBS will do a 60 Minutes special on some of this real soon.  Maybe they can get Lara Logan on the case.

0244_047e8bb0-f1ad-4f1c-aa82-777e8d4d852b	Members of the Aylesbury child abuse ring have been handed lengthy jail sentences for grooming vulnerable under-age white girls for sex for as little as "the price of a McDonald's, a milkshake and cinema ticket". \n\nThe Asian men were convicted at the Old Bailey of a range of sex offences between 2006 and 2012 including multiple rape of a child under 13, child prostitution and administering a substance to "stupefy" a girl in order to engage in sexual activity.\n\nToday, Vikram Singh, Asif Hussain, Arshad Jani, Mohammed Imran, Akbari Khan and Taimoor Khan were jailed for between three years and 19-and-a-half years.\n\nMost of the offences related to child A, who was present in court to see the men who robbed her of her teenage years sent down.\n\nIn a statement, she told of her feelings of "worthlessness" as she battled depression and alcohol addiction, adding: "I feel my teenage years were taken away from me."\n\nSentencing, judge John Bevan QC paid tribute to her bravery in laying b are her life "warts and all" and said the way some of the defendants took advantage of her vulnerability was "grotesque". \n\nHe said: "She sought friendship amongst Asian males in their 20s and for the price of a McDonald's, a milkshake and cinema ticket, she became 'liked' by stall holders in Aylesbury market, taxi and bus drivers.\n\n"By the age of 13 she was sexually experienced, confusing sexual gratification for friendship and love."\n\nBy the time she was 16, the girl had slept with just under 70 men and her vulnerability should have been "blindingly obvious", the judge said.\n\nHe went on: "Why these defendants focused their attention on white under-age girls is unexplained but I have no doubt vulnerability played a substantial part in it.\n\n"The combination of inadequate parenting leading to rebellious children lacking supervision provided an opportunity. \n\n"If they pursued Asian under-age girls, they would have paid a heavy price in their community." \n\nThe two victims came from troubled backgrounds and wanted to feel grown-up when they were befriended by the men, who groomed them by showering them with inexpensive gifts such as alcohol, DVDs, food and occasionally drugs. \n\nWhile aged just 12 or 13, child A was passed between some 60 mainly Asian men for sex after being conditioned into thinking it was normal behaviour, jurors were told.\n\nThe vast majority of the charges related to this child, while three charges related to girl B.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC told the jury the youngsters were "easy prey for a group of men wanting casual sexual gratification that was easy, regular and readily available".\n\nHe said the girls' ideas of what was right had been "completely distorted", and that they thought what was happening was "normal" and "natural".\n\nMany of the defendants were friends from the Aylesbury area. Some were married and had children, with some working on the market and a few working as taxi drivers. \n\nSingh, 45, of Cannock Road, Aylesbury, who has a wife and children, was told by Judge Bevan he bore a "heavy responsibility" for the "degradation" of Child A. He was jailed for a total of 17 and a half years for four counts of rape and administering a substance with intent. \n\nHussain, 33, of Hodge Lea, Milton Keynes, who was convicted of three counts of rape was sentenced to 13 and a half years.\n\nJani, 33, of Cousins Drive, Aylesbury, received 13 years for rape and conspiracy to rape. The court heard the bus driver had supported a wife and 17-month-old daughter in Pakistan.\n\nImran, 38, of Springcliffe Street, Bradford, was convicted of three counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to rape and one count of child prostitution. The Pakistani national was jailed for 19-and-a-half years and faces the prospect of deportation afterwards.\n\nHe was the only defendant to express remorse for his actions today, saying through his lawyer he felt "guilt and shame" for what he had done.\n\nAkbari Khan, 36, of Mandeville Road, Aylesbury, who was found guilty of two counts of rape, administering a substance with intent, and conspiracy to rape, was jailed for 16 years. He too has a wife and young daughter.\n\nTaimoor Khan, 29, of Highbridge Road, Aylesbury, was sentenced to three years in prison for one count of sexual activity with a child.\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
0245_d81030ce-22b6-49e6-a1c7-e296c0d33c92	At an event in New Hampshire Thursday, Bush said there "ought to be common ground" between Kim Davis being able to "act on her conscience" and for gay couples to be allowed to be married.  \n  Jim Cole/AP    \nKim Davis, a clerk in Rowan County, Ky., is in jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses after same-sex marriage became legal. A same-sex couple received a marriage license in Davis' office Friday morning from a deputy clerk. \n \nBut the controversy isn't over. It has divided the crowded campaign trail into those who stand with Davis, and those who don't — plus one in the middle. \n \nHere are the candidates who say Davis was wrong to refuse marriage licenses: \n \nHillary Clinton: "Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law." \n  \nMarriage equality is the law of the land. Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law—end of story. https://t.co/9WfxgULBga \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 3, 2015     \nCarly Fiorina : "We must protect religious liberties with great passion ... Having said that, when you are a government employee, I think you take on a different role. When you are a government employee as opposed to say, an employee of another kind of organization, then in essence, you are agreeing to act as an arm of the government." \n \nLindsey Graham : "This Supreme Court case is binding on her actions as a public official in Kentucky." \n \nJohn Kasich : Asked about the issue by the Washington Post, Kasich said , "I've taken my position on it." A spokesman later said he was referring to his reaction to the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decision earlier this summer. \n \nDonald Trump : "You have to go with it. The decision's been made, and that is the law of the land." \n \nJeb Bush tried to strike a middle ground at an event in New Hampshire, saying there "ought to be big enough space" for Davis and same-sex marriage licenses to co-exist. \n \nJeb Bush: "[Davis] is sworn to uphold the law and it seems to me there ought to be common ground, there ought to be big enough space for her to act on her conscience and for, now that the law is the law of the land, for a gay couple to be married in whatever jurisdiction that is." \n \nThose voicing support for Davis: \n \nTed Cruz: "I stand with Kim Davis, unequivocally." \n     \nMike Huckabee: "I want people to stand up for their convictions." \n     \nRand Paul: "I think it's absurd to put someone in jail for exercising their religious liberty." \n \nBobby Jindal : "Even rich New Yorkers should oppose jailing Christians for their religious beliefs." \n  \nHey @realDonaldTrump you can't make America great again by throwing the Christians in jail. (1/3) \n— Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) September 4, 2015      \n. @realDonaldTrump I understand asking forgiveness from God and respecting communion is a personal decision. (2/3) \n— Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) September 4, 2015      \nBut even really rich New Yorkers should oppose jailing Christians for their religious beliefs. (3/3) \n— Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) September 4, 2015     \nScott Walker : "In the end, this is the balance that you gotta have to have in America, between the laws that are out there, but ultimately ensuring that the Constitution is upheld ... I read that the Constitution is very clear that people have freedom of religion — you have the freedom to practice religious beliefs out there, it's a fundamental right." \n  Copyright 2015 NPR.

0246_a49dc03f-0141-4833-b007-bec2964803fd	MINING giant BHP Billiton's chief executive has backed a call for the United States to lift its ban on crude oil exports, ahead of a likely vote on the issue in the US Congress. ANDREW Mackenzie has also called on the world's largest economy to dismantle trade barriers with China, India and other emerging economies, saying international trade is needed to boost global growth.\n\n"If the US revises its policies on the trade in natural resources, particularly the crude oil export ban, it will be a stand for open markets," Mr Mackenzie said in a speech to the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\n"The ban is a legacy of the 1970s oil-shock, that today cuts jobs, pay, and profits in the US and worldwide."\n\nThe US House of Representatives is expected to pass a bill in coming weeks to lift the four-decade-old ban, but President Barack Obama said this week he will oppose the bill.\n\nThe lifting of the ban would cut fuel prices at the pump and add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the US economy, Mr Mackenzie argued.\n\nA misplaced fear of scarcity has led to growing resource nationalism that hurts both commodity producers and consumers alike, he said, pointing out that trade barriers created since the global financial crisis have actually slowed down global trade.\n\n"I can tell you that we have all the resources we need to meet demand, for everything we mine or drill, for many decades to come."\n\nOn Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cut its world economic growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016, warning of a dramatic slowdown in Brazil and a global outlook clouded by uncertainty over China.\n\nMr Mackenzie also called for broad trade agreements such as the TPPA and TTIP for the global economy to create trade benefits.\n\nThe US is currently in negotiations over an Asia-Pacific trade agreement, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), as well as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union.

We have most likely the best coffee culture in the world, but there was nothing in terms of milk designed to go with it. So we decided to invent it."\n\nThe key factors that cause soy and almond milk to curdle are the high acidity of black coffee and temperature. The coffee acts as a coagulant, causing the milk to split and curdle in a cup.\n\nFreedom will not reveal the secrets of some its blends. "I can tell you, getting almond milk not to split, or getting soy milk not to split and curdle when you add very hot coffee, is no easy task," De Blasio said. "It has taken us over a year. We have adjusted calcium levels, added some natural vegetable gums. The end result is we have range of milks that are perfectly matched to the acidity of high-quality espresso coffee."\n\nTo get the blends right, the MILKLAB project engaged the help of baristas in Australia and around the world, including Melbourne's Gem Fusca from Percy's Aeroplane Cafe in Kew, China's Andy Lu and Instagram's @latteartporn barista Matthew Lakejev from Sydney, whose displays of latte art have garnered him a social media following of more than 14,000.\n\n"They will not split no matter what kind of coffee or roast you throw at them," said Fusca. "I have never encountered non-dairy milks like it."\n\nThe new range of products includes milks made from soy, almond and coconut milk, as well as a lactose-free dairy milk.\n\nMILKLAB was launched at a party for 1000 latte lovers in Sydney on Friday. The story first appeared on Good Food.

0251_51a44d08-e77e-4f54-8acf-1160853642db	So I went to a lovely local antique store a few weeks back for a fun day out of the house. I had been eyeing these amazing vintage windows she had displayed on the side of her store for literally over a year, and I finally decided to go for it. While they weren't a complete steal (I usually only get things if they are dirt cheap!), I walked away with my gorgeous chippy windows for $45, dreaming of where I would hang them in my house. I brought them home, and my husband suggested we put them in the back yard instead of the garage, as they needed a lot of clean up. I am so glad I didn't bring them into the house like I wanted (I did sneak one it too see what it would look like briefly though.)    I waited a few days to work on them, and then it dawned on me... "Wait, I should do a lead paint test." (insert DUH!!!)  "I REALLY hope they don't have lead paint, but I should check anyways." So I got into our truck and drove my three year old and 6 month old to Ace Hardware. On the way there, my daughter kept asking, "Mommy, why you driving Daddy's truck?" Apparently my husband is the only one allowed to drive the truck... LOL!  I came home with a $3 lead paint test, and prayerfully went into the back yard to test my windows. The kit said the swab would turn pink for mild lead, and red for strong lead... sure enough, my swab was blood red. Waaaah! My heart broke. I got a lot of great reader information on instagram and facebook about dealing with lead paint safely, so I decided to try my hand at restoring, and covering them to make them safe for decor. I spent hours wearing a gas mask, while I sprayed down the paint on top of a tarp, and scraped the lose parts off with a paint scraper. The idea is to work wet to avoid dust and get all the loose chips off so you can seal it. If it is in good (non cracked/chipped) condition, it is recommended you leave it alone and just encapsulate lead paint. Above you can see what I ended up with. Gorgeous, distressed, shabby chic goodness. I wanted to make this work so bad, but these windows were SO beat up. I mean, look at how chippy they look AFTER I scraped them! I went to bed and prayed that God would give me peace on what to do, because THIS little guy and girl mean SO much more to me than a piece of furniture. I don't believe in being afraid of every little thing that could go wrong in life, but I want to make smart decisions for my family. My husband is the kind of person who believes in rubbing dirt in your cuts (okay, not really, right babe?) So I tend to be the one who gets on the web to look things up which isn't always a good thing for my protective mommy mind (google a symptom and yahoo answers will probably tell you you have something fatal! lol!) He told me he was supportive of whatever I decided, and honestly I should have listened to him in the first place (he thought I was being silly for buying the windows. ;) Today I researched some more, and what I found sealed the deal. A few facts: -A piece of lead the size of a grain of sand is enough to poison a child (source) -A small fistful of lead dust is enough to poison 11 houses. (source) -Lead paint is especially dangerous for children under the age of 6 (I have two under the age of  3) (source) -Our bodies aren't designed to tolerate ANY lead. -Lead paint dust can be poisonous even when it is naked to the eye. And even if your children seem healthy, they may have been contaminated and have high levels of lead in their blood. (source) -It is absorbed into your bones, and can be passed through breast-milk (I nurse), cause fertility issues (we want more kids), permanently damage the brains of children, cause mental retardation, hurt organs, and even be fatal. (source)  And all this bad stuff is totally preventable if you avoid lead paint. There are many other things it does too, but you can research them for yourself if you want to know more. Also, if you suspect you have had exposure, you can always get a blood test from a doctor. I will probably have myself and my kids tested just to be safe. I do not believe in living life in fear. And I am sure there are many safe ways to deal with it (heck, some people's houses are COVERED in lead paint!) But for me, my precious children are worth much more than those lovely windows. If they weren't literally flaking chips off, I would probably try to seal them. But in their current state, and with the knowledge I now have, the peace of mind from not having them in my house is worth far more to me. Since I didn't know they were lead paint, some of it flaked off in my yard. So I literally went and dug up the area & threw it in a garbage bag. My husband probably had himself a good chuckle seeing my pick through the grass and use tape on the driveway to get every single paint chip up. Oh, and you bet I tested other roadside picks that looked suspicious (and I have had in my house for months). Thankfully, they ended up being safe. ;) If you are local, expect to see two windows out for trash collection tomorrow with a big "lead paint" sign on them! I'll probably just have to grab a cheap pair from my habitat for humanity, frame them with new wood, and distress them manually. So no tears lost on these beauties (okay, almost no tears!) So learn from me everyone, bring a lead paint test kit around with you if you are antiquing. It will save you lots of money, and give you peace of mind. ;)

0257_2863001e-91f7-4035-b95a-3cfb2abffa1e	The founders of this nation recognized Islam as one of the world’s great faiths. Incredibly and disgracefully, much of today’s Republican Party disagrees. \n\nThomas Jefferson, whose well-worn copy of the Quran is in the Library of Congress, fought to ensure that the American concept of religious freedom encompassed Islam. John Adams wrote that Muhammad was a “sober inquirer after truth.” Benjamin Franklin asserted that even a Muslim missionary sent by “the Mufti of Constantinople” would find there was “a pulpit at his service” in this country. \n\nIndeed, the Constitution states that “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” Some of the GOP candidates for president, however, simply do not care. \n\nBen Carson said Sunday that he believes Islam to be inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore he could not support a Muslim candidate for president. “I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,” he told NBC’s Chuck Todd. “I absolutely would not agree with that.” \n\nA campaign spokesman, seeking to clarify Carson’s remarks, effectively doubled down by claiming there is a “huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith and our Constitution and American values.” \n\nCarson is dead wrong, but at least he seems sincere about it. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he could only support a Muslim candidate “who will respect the Judeo-Christian heritage of America.” Sen. Rand Paul said a president’s faith should be irrelevant, but he understood many people felt otherwise because “we were attacked by people who were all Muslim.” And front-runner Donald Trump, when asked about the possibility of a Muslim president, wisecracked, “Some people have said it already happened” – a reference to oft-repeated lies about President Obama’s faith. \n\nI was ready to offer rare praise for Sen. Ted Cruz, who rejected Carson’s outrageous view by pointing to the Constitution’s prohibition against religious tests. But then Cruz went on to say the United States should accept Christian refugees from the Syrian civil war but not Muslims, who might, after all, be terrorists. \n\nThere is an ugly undercurrent of anti-Muslim bigotry in this country, and the Republican Party panders to it in a way that the Democratic Party does not. \n\nThis rancid sentiment was on display at Trump’s town hall meeting in New Hampshire last week, at which a questioner began by stating a premise: “We have a problem in this country, it’s called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know he’s not even an American.” \n\nThe man went on to say that these problematic Muslims “have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question, when can we get rid of them?” \n\nTrump should have showed some backbone and told the man his worldview was based on paranoid fantasy. Instead, he made vague noises of agreement, or at least non-disagreement – “A lot of people are saying that. … We’re going to be looking at that and plenty of other things” – which kicked off a round of criticism from his campaign rivals. \n\nBut where were these high-minded, all-embracing Republicans when Trump and others, with no factual support, were casting doubt on Obama’s religion and birthplace? Leaving Obama aside, since he’s in a position to defend himself, where were the wise GOP elders when their party became a refuge for extremists spouting the worst kind of anti-Muslim rhetoric? \n\nAfter the  9/11 attacks, George W. Bush did an admirable and important thing: He made clear that blame for the atrocity should not be ascribed to Islam itself but rather to a small group of radical fundamentalists. \n\nGoing forward, however, his administration was neither specific enough nor consistent enough about culpability for the terrorist strike. Warmongers found it politically useful to suggest involvement by Iraq, which had nothing to do with the attacks. Meanwhile, officials downplayed the fact that most of the attackers came from Saudi Arabia, considered a valuable ally. \n\nThis fuzziness, I believe, helped give some Americans the impression that the United States was at war not with small and vicious bands of jihadists but with Muslims more broadly. Democrats almost invariably pushed back against this dangerous misimpression. Republicans far too often did not. \n\nOn the campaign trail, GOP candidates are touting their own Christian faith in what can only be described as a literal attempt to be holier than thou. They should reread the Constitution, which says “no religious test” – not “only the religious test that I can pass.” \n\nEugene Robinson’s email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com.
0258_7557fc46-5647-466a-8b5f-4ad4718c8604	Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki will be the first and only climber attempting to summit Mount Everest this season, nearly five months after dozens died in an avalanche, the mountain's deadliest accident to date. \n \nWhile the fall climbing season is a tough enough time to attempt to scale the world's highest mountain, the 33-year old plans to climb solo, without oxygen and -- even more astonishingly -- minus several fingers and a thumb he lost in a previous attempt. \n\nMajor handicap \n\nKuriki's hands were seriously damaged by frostbite during his 2012 attempt on Everest's West Ridge. \n\nHis fingers were amputated to the first joint. He can use his right thumb for grip but isn't able to fully use an ice ax -- a critical part of a mountaineer's safety equipment. \n\n"I was told by a doctor that my performance will drop by more than 20 percent," Kuriki told CNN. \n\n"I feel that it takes more time to do detailed work such as getting change from a vending machine. I lost my fingers but at the same time I learned a lot about life and many people supported me." \n\nFifth attempt \n\nKuriki is no stranger to Everest's extreme conditions, from both the Chinese and Nepalese sides of the mountain. \n\nHis September solo quest will be the Hokkaido climber's fifth attempt to summit the mountain. \n\nIn 2009, Chinese officials ordered him off the mountain before he could complete his climbing schedule. \n\nBad weather and a fatal accident with his crew ended a 2010 attempt from the Nepalese side of the mountain. \n\nOn a subsequent try in 2011, his tent poles, supplies and cooking gas were dug up by Himalayan crows at his final camp, and in 2012, extreme cold and high winds ended his quest and left him with serious frostbite. \n\nOdds stacked against success \n\nAlthough he's successfully summited a number of 8,000-meter peaks in Nepal including Cho Oyu, Manaslu, Dhaulagiri, and Mount Broad Peak, the odds of him successfully conquering Everest at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet), aren't great. \n\nMore than 10,000 climbers have tackled it since mountaineers began their assault on the massif in 1922, but it wasn't until 1953 that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay conquered the mountain. \n\nSince then, more and more climbers have challenged Everest. Only 2,974 have been successful. \n\nThe success rate is just 29 percent, and one in 10 people who attempt it die. \n\nThe risks don't lessen when climbers head for home either. Avalanches, falls, high winds, extreme cold, fatigue and altitude sickness are as much of an issue on the descent. \n\nAdded risk \n\nMost climbers use oxygen to combat the effects of the notorious death zone -- above 8,000 meters -- where the oxygen level in the air is so low, it can't sustain human life. Without supplementary oxygen, climbers battle fatigue and confusion which can lead to accidents. \n\nKuriki, who likes the challenge of winter climbing, will climb without oxygen increasing his risks significantly. \n\nIcefall Doctors fix route \n\nThe "icefall doctors," a group of Nepalese climbing specialists are already on the mountain developing a safe route of Kuriki through the notoriously dangerous area from Base Camp, across the Khumbu Iceflow to Camp 2. \n\nThe team has surveyed the area for the safest route, and placed ladders and fixed ropes to make his traverse as safe as possible. \n\nThe Nepal government closed Everest after the devastating April 25 earthquake triggered massive avalanches on the mountain killing 19, and injuring 61 others. Many of those were sheltering in the comparative safety of Base Camp. A massive helicopter and land rescue mission was needed to rescue around 230 mountaineers stranded on the mountain when the icefall doctors' route was destroyed. \n\nThe presence of the Sherpa team will be essential to Kuriki's success. If they decide weather conditions are too extreme, they'll close the mountain to climbers until spring 2016. \n\nAvoiding Everest's crowd \n\nKuriki and his support team are the only group to apply for a climbing permit since the most deadly season on record for Everest in spring 2015. Being the only team to apply for a permit in autumn isn't unusual, but he risks adverse weather, reducing his chances of success. \n\n"There are too many people on Everest in spring, which is the best season," Kuriki told CNN. \n\n"I want to feel nature and that's possible in fall without many people around." \n\nPresident of Nepal's Mountaineering Association, Kathmandu-based Ang Tsering Sherpa, knows Kuriki well and says that if the expedition isn't completed by October 8, high winds and freezing temperatures will prevent any hope of success. \n\nWhat makes him keep coming back \n\nDespite the odds, Kuriki has decided to climb without the support of fellow climbers. \n\nHe'll climb alone above Everest Base Camp while a cameraman and a Sherpa will climb separately to Camp 2 to record his climb. \n\n"When I climb by myself, I can feel things I can't in a city, and therefore, I learn from nature and grow as a human being," Kuriki said. \n\n"It's not for a record or honor. I believe everybody in the world has his or her own mountain in life. Many people might stop climbing or challenging themselves because others judge them negatively or it seems tough.' \n\n"By climbing and webcasting from Everest, I want to tell people that we can try together and share our adventures in life so they can keep trying for their dream," Kuriki told CNN.

0260_4ec1ddf7-af56-4cce-9abf-5d961d074b9f	My best friend is getting married in March next year, myself and her sister are the bridesmaids. We'd planned on getting a custom made dress from a website overseas but the good/bad news is her sister has just found out she's pregnant (that's good), which means with a changing shape the chance of the dress fitting properly is not likely as she'll be just over 8mths at the wedding (that's bad, lol).\nSo, I offered to make the dresses, which I'm actually excited about but have a big learning curve since I've very rarely sewn with lace or chiffon and have never fitted a pregnant belly before.\nThe current dress plan is a princess line bodice with a lace overlay and sleeves. The skirt will be a chiffon pleated one. I figure I'll make a couple of mock-ups, not only to check the fit but to play with the technique. I've got 2 of Claire Shaeffer's books (Couture sewing and Bridal Couture), so I'll be reading up on sewing with lace. Pattern wise, I have her Vogue 8943 which is different to how I want the dresses made but will give me a good idea on finish and overlay\nHere's the inspiration photos, the skirt is like the top photo and then add sleeves like the second photo with the lace overlay only being on the bodice. It will have more of a scooped neckline at the front.\nShe would like buttons down the back like in this pic, I'm wondering if I make it like a placket that would hide the zipper, still have to play around with that idea though. It may be easier to add a side zipper and have the back non-functioning but geez I hate side zippers! I like the idea that the zipper would be completely hidden and potentially the skirt overlay and back buttons would be not attached to the dress underlay for a couple of inches on either side and then do up and cover the zipper....not sure if its possible of how hard it would be to finish it neatly.\nI figure for C (the pregnant bridesmaid), I'll fit her a few weeks beforehand and make her dress with extra wide seam allowances and hem and then fit her properly the weekend before. I'm figuring that fitting a belly would be similar to an FBA? More length and width to fit over the bump?\nIf anyone has suggestions for books, patterns or blogs to check please let me know!
0261_ba4280e4-29f1-4273-843d-cffe662571b4	PHILADELPHIA , Sept. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ --   American Law Institute Continuing Legal Education is pleased to announce the return of The Clean Air Act: New Directions in Law, Policy, and Practice , a nationally-recognized conference that provides a comprehensive analysis of the most complex issues faced by regulators and practitioners.

0262_d9fc174f-e247-46e1-b8d6-219f5964fbe5	Presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) was moved to tears as Pope Francis reminded lawmakers that many of them are, like Rubio and the Pope himself, descended from immigrants. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nThe Pope’s call comes at a time when a record high 42.4 million U.S. residents are foreign born. \n \nIn his address, Pope Francis declared: \n \nWe must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past. We must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible… Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War… On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities… We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” \n \nIncreasing immigration has been a important issue for Senator Rubio throughout his entire career. \n \nDuring his time in Florida politics, Rubio helped  block  immigration enforcement legislation, helping make Miami o ne of the biggest sanctuary cities in the country . \n \nIn 2012, Rubio worked on his own version of a DREAM amnesty bill, which would extend birthright citizenship to foreign youths illegally residing in the country. \n \nIn 2013, Rubio co-authored and ushered through the Senate an immigration bill—praised by La Raza, President Obama and the Chamber of Commerce— that would have admitted 33 million new immigrants in the course of a single decade. \n \nIn 2015, Rubio introduced a bill that would essentially lift the university green card caps and triple the number of guest workers admitted on H-1B visas to replace American workers at lower costs. \n \nAnd just this month, Rubio announced his support for importing even more Muslim refugees into the country, whom experts say we will not be able to be vetted.
0263_9f7f77c4-d9ce-4a24-84df-b626f19757c2	The Abbott government is close to releasing a shortlist of possible sites to host a nuclear waste dump, but has missed a self-imposed August deadline. The Abbott government is close to releasing a shortlist of possible sites to host a nuclear waste dump, but has missed a self-imposed August deadline. At least four locations — two in South Australia's Kimba shire, one in Leonora in Western Australia and one in Yalgoo, WA — are among those in the running to be on the shortlist of sites that will host the "national radioactive waste management facility", though a final decision on the location is not due until 2017.\n\nThe delay in the release of the list has prompted suggestions from Labor of a link with the Canning byelection on September 19.\n\nIn March, Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane called for voluntary site nominations. An Independent Advisory Panel, established by his department, has been working with bureaucrats to evaluate the technical and community issues faced by the project since the nominations closed in May.\n\nFairfax Media has been told the initial shortlist of sites has been finalised but has not yet been taken to cabinet by Mr Macfarlane, despite for the release of the shortlist.\n\nA senior Labor source said the government was obviously worried about losing Canning and keeping Prime Minister Tony Abbott in office and that "they would not put the byelection at risk — of course they're hiding the shortlist until after 19 September."\n\n"Hell would freeze over before they released a shortlist with a nuclear dump site in WA during the Canning byelection".\n\nGindalbie Metals company secretary Christopher Gerard, whose company has put forward Badja Station in the West Australian shire of Yalgoo as a potential site, said he had expected a decision by August but the delay was not a huge cause for concern. "We would have thought it would be a decision made quickly, but we don't know the extent of the evaluation or the numbers of properties nominated," he said. "I imagine in any decision of this kind the government would consider the politics attached to it."\n\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation's Dave Sweeney, who is a member of the government's advisory panel and an anti-nuclear campaigner, said the delay would allow the government to build trust with whichever community ended up hosting the waste dump.

0264_a9ae3877-2378-4c7d-878a-478ca3db58a4	In this edition of Ask Nathan: Fun with a stick for about $25,000? Base priced Germans: 3-Series vs CLA? Is the Fiat 500c Pop worth it? Today’s first question comes from a (soon-to-be) college grad who’s looking for a fun machine with a stick for around $25K. Q: Hey Nathan, I enjoy visiting the TFLcar site daily. I am planning on graduating college in December and have begun the car search for a better daily driver than my Wrangler which I refuse to sell. Ive checked out the Mazda 6, Civic Si, and even the Corolla S. Im looking for something sporty with a manual transmission around the 25K mark. If you have any free time I’d love some more suggestions or comments on my three choices so far. Thanks in advance! -Jon from Maryland 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth Convertible First Drive & Review A: Both the Honda Civic Si and the Mazda 6 are superb choices. The Toyota Corolla Sport is a great economy ride, but not very sporty. The Mazda 6 is one of my favorites. Still, I think you missed several possibilities that deliver great bang-for-the-buck within your parameters. Here are a few: The Ford Mustang with the V6: It may be the base model, but it puts pout 300 hp through an excellent 6-speed manual gearbox. Bonus – it’s REAR DRIVE! … By the way, the same goes for the V6 Chevrolet Camaro. Fiat 500 Abarth: It’s too “cute” for some, but it packs a lot of fun in a small package. You can load one up quite a bit and keep it south of $25K. Scion tC: Still one of my favorites as it is quick, affordable, fun and very utilitarian. Mazda MX5 Miata: Emme Hall would kill me if I didn’t mention this little guy. Might be hard to find one at your price, but it’s supposed to be one of the best handling cars out there. Ford Fiesta ST: Kind of like the Fiat 500 Abarth, but with more utility. It feels like a baby Ford Focus ST – and that’s a good thing. Volkswagen Jetta 1.8T Sport: Yes, I know about the VW drama, but this is still a kick to drive and; who knows, it might be discounted soon. Scion FR-S: There are faster cars out there, but few that can handle like the FR-S. It will be hard to find one under $26K. There you go my friend, a little extra food for thought. Best of luck! N. Personally, I would go for the Mazda 6 or the V6 “Pony” cars. This next question comes from a viewer that’s looking to step up to a base-model German car. Q: Salutations TFLcar and Nathan, I am finally ready to step into the German car arena. Now, I know that you (Nathan) like Audi and that Roman prefers Mercedes Benz, but I like BMW and I hate Audi. I have about $37,000.00 to play with and I wanted to know, minus your precious Audi, which German car would you buy with tax and license left over? By the way, I want to do what you do, but I do not have the ability you have to drive crummy economy cars with enthusiasm. I honestly don’t know how you do it. Thanks Nathan! Sienna   A: Thank you so much for the kind words. Thanks for the email. I love how you worded my feelings for Audi. Truth be told, I like BMW just as much. In this case, you’re looking at two completely different cars. The Mercedes-Benz CLA 250 is a front-drive, 4-cylinder with 208 hp and 258 lbs-feet of torque fed through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. AWD is available, but it will cost you a couple grand and it will slow you down. Still, it IS a Mercedes-Benz and it is a great commuter. The seats are plush and it was an easy car to drive in traffic. Keep in mind: Mercedes-Benz never sent me a CLA (or a GLA for that matter) and I had to resort to a few private drives to come to this conclusion. Despite this, I would go with the BMW 3-Series. It’s a tad more expensive, but you get a real rear-wheel drive performer with excellent balance and an eight-speed transmission. Sure, the 4-cylinder turbo makes less horsepower and torque, (180 hp and 200 lb-ft) and there is no manual option for this base model, but it cars corners like a pro AND it is a very pleasant day-to-day driver. Either car has merits, I recommend you test drive them side-by-side on the same day. Best of luck! N — This last email comes from a sun lover who is conflicted about buying a Fiat 500c Pop. Q: I love the Fiat 500c Pop and want to buy one. Is there another car in this price range that you would consider? I mean, is it worth it? Is it a good car too? Seriously, I can’t think of anything that can hold four people that’s as inexpensive as the Fiat 500c Pop! Help! O. ps – no JEEPS!   A: Thanks for the email! You’re right, there is nothing in this class that can compete with the Fiat 500c Pop as it is the only four-passenger convertible in that price bracket. You could always get something used for the same price and I would suggest looking at Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) cars. As for new cars? Nope, nothing comes to mind. Mustangs and Camaros are too pricey and the rest of the cars out there are two seaters. Fiat builds good little cars. They are not up there with Toyota quality, but the regular Fiat 500 isn’t too shabby either. It’s a pretty good value too. So, I guess that’s it, you’re headed to Fiat country!

0265_6137d620-a68d-414d-a7d9-6a75a84963c9	VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Sept. 8, 2015) - Medgold Resources Corp. (TSX VENTURE:MED) (the "Company" or "Medgold") is pleased to provide an exploration update from the Boticas gold project. Recent reconnaissance rock-chip sampling, exploring areas outside of the main Limarinho Zone, has yielded results of 71.9 g/t Au, 45.0 g/t Au and 22.4 g/t Au from the newly identified Casas Novas and Leiranco zones, from a total of 28 samples. \n \nMedgold has also recently been granted the Chaves exploration licence which completely envelops the Boticas licence, creating a total combined ground holding of over 600 sq km over this emerging gold district. \n \nDan James, President of Medgold, said, "We are very encouraged with progress at Boticas. The newly discovered Casas Novas zone, which was identified by remote sensing and soil sampling, is potentially significant and returned high-grade mineralization with assays from trace up to 71.9 g/t Au. This area is now a high-priority target. Rock chip samples from another area called Leiranco, which was identified from academic literature, yielded results of up to 22.4 g/t Au. Past explorers focused mainly on the highly prospective Limarinho Zone, but Medgold is working to place Limarinho into its proper regional context, and we are expanding our licence holding and working-up new targets throughout the district. With the recent granting of the Chaves licence, we are well positioned to continue exploration within our 100% owned project." \n \nThe Boticas Licence \n \nThe Boticas licence is located in northern Portugal, close to the towns of Boticas and Chaves, and is 100% owned by Medgold. The geological target is for granite-associated orogenic gold systems. These are structurally-controlled systems with gold mineralization occurring within quartz veins and as disseminations commonly associated with sericite-silica-sulphide alteration. \n \nThe principle prospect of the Boticas licence is the Limarinho zone. This area has received over 3,000m of diamond drilling, completed by COGEMA and Kernow Resources, in the 1980s and 2000s, respectively. This work identified both broad zones of low-grade mineralization (approx. 1 g/t Au), and also multiple mineralized corridors of much higher grade (2-3 g/t Au) that are continuous over hundreds of metres. These corridors trend east-northeast, while the veins therein trend northeast. The mineralization is structurally-controlled and developed within a large deformational lense. \n \nRecent work ( see press release dated July 21, 2015 ) included the completion of reconnaissance soil sampling and ground magnetics around the Limarinho zone, with the aim of expanding the known area of mineralization. The soil sampling results identified an area of 3 km by 2 km which is far larger than the existing Limarinho zone. Recent results from rock chip sampling, collected from zones within the soil anomaly yielded 15 new results from 0.01 g/t Au to 45.00 g/t Au, 13.90 g/t Au and 11.75 g/t Au, which are in addition to previously reported highs of 75.10 g/t Au, 6.91 g/t Au and 4.53 g/t Au. \n \nThe newly discovered Casas Novas zone is located approximately 3 km southeast of the Limarinho zone. The prospect was discovered by Medgold through remote sensing and grid-soil sampling. Previously reported results from soil sampling identified a coincident gold- and arsenic-in-soil anomaly of approximately 3 km by 2 km. Recent rock sampling has yielded 4 new results from 0.02 g/t Au to highs of 71.90 g/t Au and 5.20 g/t Au in float samples. Previous sampling yielded highs of 5.53 g/t Au and 1.63 g/t Au in outcrop samples. This area is now a high-priority target and will be the focus of detailed grid-soil sampling programs. \n \nThe Leiranco zone, which was previously known only to academics from the Universities of Porto and Oviedo, was recently studied by Medgold geologists. It is located approximately 5 km to the west of Limarinho and is an outcropping vein swarm covering an area of approximately 300 metres by 300 metres. Reconnaissance rock chip samples yielded 9 new results from 0.06 g/t Au to highs of 22.40 g/t Au, 4.80 g/t Au and 3.75 g/t Au. This area will be the focus of detailed channel-chip sampling in the coming months. \n \nPlease see http://www.medgoldresources.com/s/boticas.asp for location maps for each of the prospects with rock and soil results, as well as photos of mineralization from historical drill core. \n \nThe Chaves Licence \n \nThe Chaves licence was granted by the Portuguese government on 17 th August 2015. It is approximately 500 sq km and completely envelopes the Boticas. Medgold applied for the licence to increase our landholding in the region, and covers several major crustal structures, which are considered to be associated with gold mineralization. The area also covers multiple stream sediment (BLEG) anomalies identified from historical work completed in early 2000s. Medgold has conducted a lineament analysis over the area, which was combined with a broad hyperspectral analysis for alteration (iron, silica and clay). The work has identified several coincident structural and alteration anomalies that will be the focus of the on-going exploration programme. \n \nLocated approximately 20 km due east of the Limarinho anomaly, and located within the Chaves licence, is the Carvela zone. The area is a contact zone between the Hercynian granites and Ordovician metasediments, and was the focus of a phase of exploration completed by COGEMA in the 1980s. A total of 37 diamond drill holes were completed for a reported total of 3,000m. From a review of the historical drill logs, mineralization appears to be controlled by a major shear structure, and COGEMA's drilling campaign successfully hit gold mineralization in 62% of their drill holes, and best intercepts were: 1.0m @ 14.0 g/t Au on CAR03 and 1.8m @ 10.5 g/t Au in CAR13*. Work in the near future will focus on studying the historical drill logs and reviewing surface mineralization with an aim to define suitable high-grade drill targets. \n \n* These are historical data provided for information purposes and, while the Company feels the historical data is reliable, it has not completed sufficient work to verify these results. \n \nPrevious Work \n \nA total of 3,234 metres of historic diamond drilling was completed at Limarinho in 26 holes by COGEMA in the 1980s, and in the early 2000s by Kernow Resources & Developments Ltd. Key drill intercepts are as follows**: \n KL4: 20.4 m @ 2.92 g/t Au from 20.7 m, and 9.05 m @ 3.37 g/t Au from 145.0 m PF3: 19.7 m @ 2.80 g/t Au from 32.3 m PF11: 12.1 m @ 2.98 g/t Au from 51.1 m PF17: 13.5 m @ 2.17 g/t Au from 65.7 m PF8: 10.0 m @ 1.37 g/t Au from 86.2 m  \n* * These are historical data provided for information purposes and Medgold has not completed sufficient work to verify these results. \n \nThese zones of higher-grade intersections are cohesive along strike and at depth, with veining occurring oblique to the general zone direction, and occur within a much broader envelope of ~1 g/t Au mineralization. \n \nQuality Assurance/ Quality Control \n \nSamples were prepared by ALS Minerals at the Seville Laboratory, Spain. Soil samples were analyzed for gold using 50gm fire assay with ICP analysis and multi-elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer by ALS Minerals at the Omac Laboratory, Ireland. Rock samples were analyzed for gold using 50gm fire assay with AAS analysis and multi elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer by ALS Minerals at the Omac Laboratory, Ireland. \n \nCertified reference materials, blanks, and field and laboratory duplicates were routinely inserted for quality assurance and quality control.  \n \nQualified Person \n \nDavid Clark, PGeo, consulting geologist to the Company, is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. Clark has reviewed and approved the disclosure of technical information contained in this news release. \n \nAbout Medgold \n \nMedgold is aiming to become the leading Mediterranean-focused gold exploration and project development company, with an extensive portfolio and pipeline of projects in Portugal and Spain, targeting economically stressed, but politically stable European countries that are seeking foreign investment to invigorate the mining sector. \n \nAdditional information on Medgold can be found on the Company's website at www.medgoldresources.com and by reviewing the Company's page on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . \n \nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD \n \nDaniel P.

0266_6de43e35-be15-4b44-8d23-95f748bc37b6	NEW DELHI: India today hoped that there will be genuine reconciliation with the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, which immediately reciprocated saying it was looking at constitutional devolution of power to the ethnic minority. \n\nThe issue figured prominently in a meeting between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Ranil Wickremesinghe who made his first foreign visit to India after becoming Prime Minister nearly a month ago following victory in the Parliamentary elections. \n\nThe two leaders held extensive talks on the sticky fishermen issue and explored ways to deepen trade and defence engagements besides resolving to intensify cooperation in combating terror and securing the maritime neighbourhood. \n\n"I am confident that with the wisdom and will of the leadership in Sri Lanka and the support of the people, Sri Lanka will achieve genuine reconciliation and development, so that all Sri Lankans, including the Sri Lankan Tamil community, can live a life of equality, justice, peace and dignity in a united Sri Lanka," said Modi at a joint media briefing. \n\nWickremesinghe, on his part, responded saying his government was looking at devolution of power to ethnic Tamils under the provisions of the Constitution. \n\n"We are looking at how power sharing takes place within the Constitution," he said. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment on devolution of powers to fulfil the aspirations of the ethnic Tamils. \n\nThe 13th amendment that followed the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord of July 1987 signed between then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J R Jayewardene envisaged devolution of powers to the provinces in the midst of the island's bitter ethnic conflict. \n\nOn the fishermen issue, Modi said it was agreed that fishermen's associations on both sides should continue their efforts to find a solution. \n\n"I conveyed to him that this should be seen as a humanitarian issue that affects livelihoods. I informed him of the steps we are taking to encourage Indian fishermen to take up deep sea fishing," he said. \n\nWickremesinghe said fishermen on both sides should continue discussions and come to a conclusion to resolve it in a time-bound manner. \n\nThanking Wickremesinghe for choosing India for his first overseas trip after assuming charge of the high office, Prime Minister said both the countries will intensify cooperation in combating terrorism and work together for security and stability in the maritime neighbourhood. \n\n"We recognise our closely aligned security interests and the need to remain sensitive to each other's concerns. We both reaffirmed our commitment to deepen our defence and security cooperation," he said.

0269_b7144ed2-15c2-4be5-9d96-706d286b220c	My birthday is coming up on Tet-Vav Tishrei which falls on September 27 this year. And yes, it is Tet-Vav and not Yud-Daled as some people keep telling me. I was born at night, after the stars came out, so that makes it the next day, that is Tet-Vav. So there!\n\nAs usual, the full moon is the most important thing for me on my Jewish birthday. Since the time I started observing the cycles of the moon in relation to my cycles and my body, it became imperative for me to see the full moon of Tishrei every year. One year, there was a sandstorm on that day which completely blotted out the moon, and I was utterly depressed and riding an enormous tidal wave of rage. I wrote an angry entry in my diary and nearly tore through the page with my pen.\n\nLast week, we once again had a crazy sandstorm that was so bad it made it hard to breathe. Pregnant women, children and the elderly were advised to stay indoors, with the windows closed, and the AC working overtime. Since no rain would fall for another couple of months, I feared that the sand would persist all through the month and I will once again be faced with a faded smudge of white on a diarrhea-tinted night-sky on my birthday, and my levels of pissed-off-ness would go right off the charts.\n\nBut now that the dust had indeed settled, here's another thing that might ruin the moon visibility on my birthday: the full lunar eclipse which is set to take place in the early morning hours of the 28th. That's cutting it really fucking close, and I hope to the Goddess and the moon angel that I will be able to see the full pearly moon before it turns to red (as they say it does during a lunar eclipse).\n\nAlso, I wonder what it means, if it means anything, in terms of astrology. I never really put my faith (or fate for that matter) in horoscopes. But I do believe that the moon and the stars and the planets in our galaxy affect events on our planet in some way. I think horoscopes are a poor indication of this phenomenon, but it does happen somehow. So I wonder what the lunar eclipse will bring forth.\n\nI also recently found out that there is in fact a connection between the Zodiac system and Judaism. I don't know why I never realized this before. I mean, if anything, it is so obvious that Libra would fall on the Jewish new year. This is a time of judgement and of justice. The Goddess measures our good and evil deeds on a scale, just like the Libra, and we atone for our sins on the Day of Atonement in order to tip the scales in our favor. I'm not sure what the other Zodiac signs mean in relation to the other Jewish months, but this Libra timing is too perfect to be a coincidence.\n\nThe moon has been dark earlier this week. I think it will start peeking sometime tonight as a thin crescent that I like to call a fingernail clipping. Hello moon! Welcome back!\n\nPeace, love and still a proud Libra!

Image:  Universal Pictures By Jordan Hoffman 2015-09-15 20:25:34 UTC  \nIf The Dressmaker is good for nothing else, it will mark the moment that Kate Winslet began her transformation into our wacky, awesome aunt. \n \nThis strange but not-very-successful film, based on a popular Australian novel, is a rare example of how sometimes a movie can still be enjoyable even when it is bad. Winslet's Tilly Dunnage is the prodigal daughter returning to a 1950s fictional, middle-of-nowhere berg loaded with quirky characters (think 90s TV show Northern Exposure but with sand instead of snow.) \n \nSEE ALSO: 'Spotlight' movie review: A thrilling dive into masterful journalism \n \nShe's come back to see her ailing mother, Mad Molly (Judy Davis), a crazy old bat who lives on a hill overlooking the town. Tilly hasn't been home since she was “sent away” as a young girl, accused of committing a murder of which she has no recollection. \n \nTilly isn't the only one with amnesia. Molly doesn't recognize her at first, and the mother of the dead kid has been kept doped up by her philandering husband all these years. The only one who remembers everything is the mentally challenged older brother of the very handsome farmer played by Liam Hemsworth. Hemsworth's smile and physique are so arresting that you are supposed to not notice that his brother is barking clues to the great mystery the whole time. (One of a number of bunkum clichés.) \n \n[embedded content] \n \nDistraction through physicality is the name of the game in The Dressmaker . The whole town bakes in the sun in their awful rags, but Tilly comes to down in a blazing red dress, causing all the footballers to trip over one another. There are a number of “work it, girl!” moments that will make for fabulous GIFs –- hardly the mark of great cinema, but enjoyable nonetheless. \n \nWhile Tilly's been away she's become something of the Tony Stark of the Singer sewing machine, and can transform any frumpy gal into a pin-up. Soon this entire backwater hamlet is hustling up and down their unpaved main street in gorgeous haute couture. There are many amusing montages, especially when Hugo Weaving, the local cop with a volcanic passion for ladies' fabric, gets in on the act. But Tilly's return unsettles the balance of this sleepy town, leading to a full social conflagration. \n \nFor reasons that are a little vague (remember, so many are suffering from varying degrees of amnesia) there commences a round-robin of bitchy backbiting. It makes for a lot of moments that pop -– extreme close-ups of Winslet in fierce outfits taking no guff, or of no-nonsense Judy Davis dropping truthbomb lines that Joan Crawford or Bette Davis would have loved. \n \nBut with so much antic chaos all over the place (lots of zany chase scenes in poofy gowns) the signal-to-noise ratio becomes unmanageable. The Dressmaker also has one of the stupidest deaths in the history of all movies. You are supposed to be heartbroken, but good luck not laughing when some dumbass drowns in a grain silo trying to impress a girl. \n \nStill, just when you are about to check out, Hugo Weaving comes back in an enormous hat with a peacock feather. \n \nAt the center of it is Winslet's Tilly, an undeniably interesting character. As a community outsider with secrets and a flair for the flamboyant, one can see how Winslet is leaning in to a growing career as a gay icon. (Her striking, increasing physical resemblance to Madonna only adds more fuel to this fire.) \n \nThese colorful patches are exciting, but the overall outfit still clashes. \n \nHave something to say about this review?

0272_3da0df75-bac8-47d3-9a08-9c3d15f7e0da	Few are willing to connect this horrible day 14 years ago with yesterday when the glorious Iran nuclear limitations treaty approval by Congress. I see a direct line between the two that becomes even clearer when we extend our thinking back to George W. Bush and his war Iraq. Osama bin Laden attacked and beat the hell out of them. In the minds of the right wing warmongers, “We proved without question that our might makes us right.” We want their oil. We wanted to be dominant in the Middle East. We wanted to protect Israel. We want economic dominance (hegemony) over England, Germany, but especially Russia. Yes, there is a direct line but that does not mean it is a simple single line. If fact, it is extremely complicated, convoluted line. The quest for oil turned out not to be the windfall most energy companies thought. However, the most unexpected twist in that line turned out to be Israel. A majority vote in the United Nations to partition Palestine proved the world approved the creation of Israel as a Jewish dominated sovereign country completely free of the fear of pogrom; and, so it was. Nevertheless, years of strife in the region followed that eventually led to the creation of an extreme right-wing party in Israel, the Likud Party, equal to the extreme right wing in the United States. The strife evolved to a Zionist versus Islamist. The focus was over Palestine versus Israel; A massive influx of immigrates forced a drive for more land. Israel was no longer a Vatican-like religion sanctuary but a physicals sanctuary for all the Jews in the world. With the aid of tremendous amounts of Jewish propaganda money, the strife evolved to Zionists plus Christianity, which, of course, meant the Western world versus Islamists. George W. and his saber rattling advisors sharpened this divide by the Iraqi war, which eventually resulted in the horror of 9/11. The turmoil surrounding Palestine eventually expanded or evolved into Saudi Arabia becoming the center of one Islamic sect versus Iran, who formed the center of another sect. Of course, Muslims had these sects historically ingrained before the current strife. Added to this was another significant change in Israel with the election of radical Benjamin Netanyahu as the voice of Israel. On the back of the propaganda machine, he allied himself with the radical elements of the Republican Party in the United States or they added him to their cause. All of this set the stage for a multifactor war of words with one of the most powerful efforts being toward maintaining Israel with the blessing of a major political party in the U.S. as the only nuclear, thus dominate power in the Middle East without allowing the Arabs to expand their nuclear capability. It would take a diplomatic genius to solve the tangled dilemma. Not only would that genius, whoever it had to be in a position of power. How could someone overcome all the Jewish equivalent of Hitler-like ethnic hate aimed at “all” Arabs and Arabs aiming all of their hate at Jews at the same time overcome the voter seeking Republican Party? How could anyone divide and redirect the sectarian hate to have one sect help to prevent one sect from developing a nuclear bomb? How could Israeli be sovereignty be guaranteed at the same time making Israel the diplomatic equivalent of their neighbors? How could that genius wean Israel from its dependence on the Untied States in spite of a major political party opposing it? I am here to tell you on September 10, 20015, 14 years minus one day after September 11 President Obama did all of that with the Iran Non-proliferation Treaty. When Congress failed to rip the treaty apart, President Obama will stand forever as a champion of world peace. URL: firetreepub.blogspot.com Comments Invited and not moderated

The season two premiere of Empire wasted no time diving right back into the heated dealings of the Lyon family. Although Lucious (Terrence Howard) remained behind bars, he still pulled a fast one on his ex-wife. After Cookie brought in investor Mimi Whiteman (Marisa Tomei) to help her and her boys get a controlling share of Empire and subsequently remove Lucious as CEO, Jamal (Jussie Smollett) went behind Cookie's back and convinced Mimi to invest with him and Lucious instead.\n\nThe middle Lyon son's betrayal of his beloved mother was just the beginning. The episode ended with Jamal kicking Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray), Andre (Trai Byers), Rhonda (Kaitlin Doubleday) and Cookie out of his father's house, even after Cookie tried to slap some sense into him, twice. "If season one of Empire was about who will inherit the throne, season two is warring kingdoms," showrunner Ilene Chaiken tells The Hollywood Reporter about the next move for the rest of the Lyon clan.\n\nChaiken also spoke with THR about Jamal's "suffering" this season, Hakeem's "huge evolution" and what to expect when Cookie's other sister comes to town.\n\nThat was quite a transformation for Jamal. Why did he take his father's side over the rest of the family?\n\nJamal spent his entire life longing for his father's love, and he finally got it. [It's] such a big story for us in season one and such a big deal in this young man's life – to finally get his father's love and acceptance. When this divide occurs between his mother and his father and it looks to him as if Cookie might actually might have betrayed Lucious, he's torn. But he got the empire and Cookie tried to take it away from him, and he feels betrayed by her. So he takes his father's side. Read More: He didn't necessarily have to go so far as to kick them all out of his father's house. What was the motivation behind that?\n\nBecause he so felt so profoundly betrayed. They all acted against him behind his back. I feel for him. I believe that action was motivated.\n\nIt was such a moving scene because of how Cookie reacted. She slaps him not once but twice. How does that rift with Jamal affect her going forward?\n\nIt's a huge heartbreak for her, and I think you see it most in that moment, but we play it throughout. It's very, very painful for Cookie to be estranged. He's been her everything. As you know, he was the only member of her family who stood by her throughout her entire 17 years in prison. When she came out, it was all about the relationship between the two of them. She lifted him up, she helped him to become the man is, to get where he is, and she helped him to reconnect with his father because she cared so deeply and selflessly about him and she lost him because of it.\n\nWhat can you say about her relationship with Hakeem after this because they were much closer in the premiere than they were last season?\n\nThree months have gone by and you can presume over the course of those three months, she did reconcile with Jamal. There's still a little tension between them before the reveal that she led a hostile takeover but they definitely reconciled. Were it not for the hostile takeover, they would have repaired their relationship. But in the meantime, she and Hakeem and Andre have been working together and getting to know one another. She spent the first whole season of the show desperately trying to create a relationship, to build a relationship with her youngest son whom she has no relationship with. This is the beginning of a relationship between her and Hakeem. It's a big deal for both of them, and a relationship in which Hakeem is really growing.\n\nWhat is the next step of his evolution this season?\n\nHe has a huge arc in this season, and a huge evolution. It's a real growth story, it's a story of a boy becoming a man and you really see it, and he plays it beautifully. It's one of the things that I'm most excited about this season because it's what we set out to do and it feels like we're doing it very successfully. You really see him coming into his own, learning skills, changing his behavior, backsliding and then recovering. It's something that we play repeatedly throughout the season to a real pointed conclusion.\n\nHakeem and Anika are still together in in the premiere but viewers don't see too much about their relationship. What can you say about their relationship going forward? How does that affect his relationship with his mom? Hakeem and Anika are not a couple, and the relationship is a vague and undefined relationship for both of them. It's something that they each got into for reasons that have to do with things other than love and affection; not really a good place to start a relationship. Anika is someone in whom he takes comfort from time to time and she helped him through a lot of difficult moments. They want different things from one another, but Cookie will make it very hard for Hakeem to continue in that relationship.\n\nAnika proved in the premiere that she was willing to do whatever it takes to be a part of this company. Why? What is her driving force?\n\nShe wants to be a part of the company and she has a kind of unhealthy obsession with the Lyons. She just invested so much of herself in her relationship with Lucious and in his company, and she'll do anything to stay in that mix.\n\nGoing back to Jamal, he had trouble balancing being at the head of Empire and being an artist in the premiere. How will he come to handle that in future episodes?\n\nJamal becoming the head of Empire, especially with his father in prison, is very much a case of careful what you wish for. The second he gets the opportunity, Jamal will bust out of his corporate chains because Jamal is an artist at heart and he is really suffering under the burden of responsibility. He needs to get back to making his art. He needs to get back on his journey to becoming a star, which he had just begun when he got derailed by Lucious' incarceration.\n\nMarisa Tomei made a big entrance to the show when she switched sides in the premiere. What can we expect from her working relationship with Jamal and Lucious?\n\nHer relationship will primarily be with Lucious. They really connect, and she did him a solid, to say the least. It's going to be an interesting working relationship between two powerful titans, each with an agenda.\n\nLucious went out on a limb for Cookie in the premiere in having his allies take care of Frank in prison. How does that change their relationship?\n\nIt doesn't change anything. It's just what they do for one another. The essence of their relationship is articulated in that scene when Cookie comes to him. It's a relationship between two people who love and hate one another with equal passion and they can't get away from either of those feelings, and he will defend her to the death. He'll defend his family, but especially Cookie, and yet, they will never stop being the bane of one another's existence. Read More: What is next in terms of Lucious' incarceration?\n\nHe's not going to be in jail for too much longer. In the second episode, he finds the means to work the system as he inevitably would. Lucious Lyon knows how to work the system, and we'll see it work to his advantage.\n\nWill there be any blowback or ramifications from what Lucious did to Frank or is that close-ended?\n\nWe're not going to be dealing with another murder case for Lucious. I think he managed that situation with Frank pretty well. He's well covered. It's not going to come back and bite him the way Bunkie did, but the act itself has season-long ramifications for him regardless of that. It's definitely an act that continues to feature in his life, his relationships and his story.\n\nAndre is still dealing with the aftermath of Vernon's death in the season one finale. How does that struggle take a toll on him going forward?\n\nThe struggle takes a big toll on him psychologically and pushes him further into his faith as he grapples with what he's done and the moral implications of it. That’s ongoing for Andre, and for Rhonda. It's an issue in their relationship, an issue when they contemplate bringing a child into the world, but this specific story with Vernon, the thing that happened in the last episode of our last season, also has a very explicit consequence in the early part of our season. It plays a big role in Andre's faith.\n\nNews recently broke about Vivica A. Fox playing Cookie's other sister. What hints can you give about that relationship?\n\nWe'll see the relationship among the three sisters, and explore family in their scenes and their story together. It's something that [co-creator] Lee Daniels has talked a lot about and promised, which is, as well as being a story about family, it's an exploration of class and culture. It's an opportunity to talk about where Cookie came from and where she is now, and the disparities between extreme poverty and extreme wealth that are hard to talk about and fascinating. Particularly in the hip-hop culture, there are those stories of people who come from the most abject circumstances becoming unthinkably wealthy, and what does that do to not only the individual, but the family relationships.\n\nThat's something that was touched on in the premiere because Cookie's sister was trying desperately to get in touch with her about the rose from Frank and she had a lot of trouble. How much do you think Cookie has changed from the beginning of the series to now?\n\nClearly, in some ways, she's intrinsically who she is, but she's changed. Even if she hasn’t changed, people will accuse her of having changed. There will always be people, particularly those closest to her, who resent her or want something from her and thinks she owes it to them.\n\nEmpire airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Fox.

0275_3bb76b4a-6534-41dc-9d2a-a56d3d0c64bc	MADISON COUNTY, Ala. – Elizabeth Wharry has lived in the neighborhood on Brier Ridge Court in Madison County for several years. “It’s normally a very quiet place to be.” \n \nElizabeth Wharry \n \nHer neighbors across the street were pleasant, but Wharry says there was tension inside the home. \n \n“It started about three or four years ago; the ex-girlfriend, there was always a ruckus and disruption. Always drama,”​said Wharry. “And I’d be inside my house and I could hear it.” \n \nShe never saw anything physical, so she chalked it off to arguments and adds just a short time ago, the couple broke up. “I thought she was gone for good, I really did. I thought she’d stay away for good,” said Wharry. \n \nSo you could imagine her shock to hear LaShonda Smith shot Karieem Robinson and an 11-year-old child, before turning the gun on herself. Robinson died from his injuries. The 11-year-old child that was shot in the head is in the intensive care unit, still. \n \nElizabeth Wharry prays with a loved one of Karieem Robinson’s outside the home he was murdered in Sept. 22. \n \nWhile loved ones grieved; Wharry prayed. “I’m a prayer warrior, that’s the only thing I knew to do.” \n \nThe feeling of loss is one Wharry knows all too well. “I wish someone had done that for me when my mother was murdered back in ’91, but there was no one,” said Wharry. So she sang the same song that got her through it, hoping it would give Robinson’s girlfriend the same peace. \n \n“I’m only doing what I’m called to do; and that’s reach out,” said Wharry. \n  34.796992  -86.745751
0276_7bd09fe1-88eb-41e2-ba9a-92ea6f429c39	“When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” – Yogi Berra \n\nWith the passing of baseball legend and “accidental philosopher,” Yogi Berra, the news feeds are full of what came to be known as “Yogi-isms.” Many of these foolish-on-the-surface but wise-underneath truisms have even passed into the realm of colloquialisms. But whatever “ism” we assign to it, the one about the fork in the road has been one of my favorite reminders to myself. \n\nThe number of decisions the average adult makes in a day has been estimated at 35,000. Based on my observations and experience in working with business owners for more than 20 years I’d say the average entrepreneur makes at least three times that number. \n\nWhat I just did there, making a quick calculation based on a personal rule of thumb, is an example of something psychologists call a heuristic; a logical short cut to making decisions quickly and efficiently based on experience and common rule-of-thumb. \n\nHeuristics, these lightening-swift short cut calculations we work in our minds with very little mental energy expended, keep us from getting bogged down in relatively risk-free decision making. But they can also lead to miscalculations. \n\nSo what should we do when we come to that fork in the road? Apply our rule-of-thumb-based-on-experience heuristic short cut to pick a direction and keep on truckin’? Pause, examine the map and our choices before taking one more step? Or wallow in indecision, asking directions from everyone we meet and wringing our hands because there isn’t enough data to make a fail-safe choice? \n\nI find that decision making in business really is a lot like taking a road trip. Which means I learned a lot about entrepreneurship from my dad. Even though he was a professional over-the-road driver, Dad’s idea of a vacation was to load up the camper and drive halfway across the country just for fun. But he always had a destination in mind, and he was not a fan of detours. So my mom and I learned a lot about navigation. \n\nRelated: Decisions, Decisions: What Separates Leaders From the Rest \n\nAs a tiny-town girl from southeast Kansas who was just learning to read road signs I thought if a sign said that the road went to Des Moines you shouldn’t take the road unless Des Moines was your intended destination. So I was vocally unhappy when we took the exit for Des Moines because that was not where I’d been told we were going. Of course my father, with his superior experience and map reading ability, knew exactly what he was doing. \n\nThe same is true in your business. You’ll have well-meaning backseat drivers who point to signs and share their concerns that the fork you just took is leading you off-course. Certainly, if the concerns are coming from someone with a lot of miles under their belt you might want to pull over and check your facts. But heuristics (or what we often think are instincts) are a lot more dependable than we usually give ourselves credit for. Trust yourself. \n\nRelated: Trust Your Own Focus Group of One \n\nAnother thing I had to get used to when it came to highway navigation was that a split in the lanes didn’t mean the road we were on was now a new road. Sometimes that “fork” was just a different path splitting off while we continued on our original course. \n\nOften in business the true choice is to stay on track or take a different direction, but we mistake that for a mandatory detour. Entrepreneurs are easy prey for rabbit holes, bright shiny objects and mysterious possibilities. Even when our mental short cut thinking is urging us to stick to our plan we’re curious about the what ifs and haunted by the might-have-beens. Don’t let the fear of missing out take time and fuel away from reaching your goals. \n\nSometimes we come to a fork in the road and we don’t want to take either one of them. Like the time we were traveling to Happy, Texas. The road my dad wanted to take was closed and the detour was going to add hours to our trip. We backtracked to a roadside truck stop, Dad went and pow-wowed with a couple of truckers who knew the back roads, and when he returned to the car he had a new plan. \n\nI hear a lot of entrepreneurs use phrases like, “I had to do either this or that, I didn’t have any other choice.” But it’s seldom that our choices in business are so binary. This is the time to abandon heuristics, which can make it difficult to see alternatives or come up with creative solutions. Take a break, get new input, brainstorm the possibilities and create a third, or even fourth option for moving forward. \n\nThere is no one right way to “take the fork.” Relying on heuristics for the low-risk decisions leaves you more bandwidth for researching and contemplating the more significant crossroads. But ultimately, it’s all about your destination. Which, of course, brings us to a final Yogi-ism: \n\n“You have to be very careful if you don’t know where you are going, because you might not get there.” – Yogi Berra \n\nRelated: Your Anxiety Contributes to Your Bad Decisions
0277_c6be4b82-e2aa-4a52-8385-9abea1be65ec	Welcome back to the ballroom. The pseudo-celebs were movin’ and groovin’ Monday evening when Dancing with the Stars kicked off its 21st season.\n\nAlthough Len Goodman wasn’t sitting at the judge’s table, he was there in spirit and Tom Bergeron’s pocket square which he borrowed.\n\n13 couples competed, and heck yes, that is a whole lotta dancing, but don’t worry. If you missed a moment, that’s what we’re here for. So let’s foxtrot, quickstep, jive, and cha cha now y’all.\n\nAt first dance, Bindi appears to be this season’s Sadie Robertson. Her smile lights up a room like that coveted mirror ball trophy. And, it turns out when Bindi would dance around as a little girl at the zoo, her moves would make her dad, Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, cry. Awwwww! And no, we don’t think they were crocodile tears.\n\nBindi danced a jive to Crocodile Rock because she is awesome. And before performing hummed her personal theme song Eye of the Tiger because of course she did. Bindi danced an hour and half into the show, and judge Julianne Hough said that it was the best performance of the night.\n\nThe other judges did not disagree.\n\nCarrie Ann Inaba: 8, Julianne Hough: 8, Bruno Tonioli: 8\n\nCarlos is fellow DWTS contestant Alexa PenaVega’s hubby which we think could make things really interesting. His jive kicked off the top of the second hour, and Julianne said he was the most natural performer that she’d seen thus far.\n\nWe agree, and so do those people with the paddles.\n\nCarrie Ann: 8, Julianne: 8, Bruno: 7\n\nBackstreet’s back! Well at least the one that we thought was the cutest anyway. Yeah, Brian’s aight, but we were always a Nick fan, swoon! Even though he’s been in a boy band far beyond puberty, Nick said he was always insecure about his dancing. Let’s see if his fangirling partner can change that with a cha cha.\n\nSince every 30 going on 13-year-old is going to vote for him, we think he’ll be around for awhile. And these judges scores don’t hurt either.\n\nCarrie Ann: 8, Julianne: 8, Bruno: 8\n\nAlek is one of the brave men that saved passengers on a train headed to Paris back in August. And, before the American hero even started dancing, the audience was already on their feet. Alek danced an absolutely beautiful foxtrot, and it goes without saying we had the chills.\n\nCarrie Ann: 8, Julianne: 7, Bruno: 7\n\nObviously, for saving all of those lives we give him a 10!\n\nAlexa and Mark danced a pretty lively and sexy jive. Though her husband, Carlos, joked about being jealous of her immediate closeness with her partner, he was incredibly proud of her performance. He cheered her on once her dance was finished and booed Carrie Ann when she delivered some criticism.\n\nCarrie Ann: 7, Julianne: 7, Bruno: 8\n\nYou might remember Andy performed his hit, Honey, I’m Good, last season on DWTS. The artist said he wanted to join the cast this season because his late mother loved dancing, and being a part of the show made him feel closer to her. I mean, shut up. We love him. Give us the phone. We’re voting for him right now!\n\nCarrie Ann said he needed to work on his connection with Allison, but Julianne disagreed. Overall he got some pretty decent scores for his foxtrot.\n\nCarrie Ann: 7, Julianne: 7, Bruno: 7\n\nTamar is fortunate enough to be paired with last year’s champion. Val walked away with the mirror ball trophy after a stellar season with Rumer Willis. His quickstep with Tamar got a standing ovation from the crowd, but Bruno knocked her for misplacing her feet.\n\nCarrie Ann: 8, Julianne: 7, Bruno: 8\n\nThis adorable Vine star did a cha cha to Cheerleader, which if you ask us needed a little more pep. Bruno called him a “boy wonder,” and we’re sure with his social following he’ll be around for many more shows to come.\n\nCarrie Ann: 7, Julianne: 7, Bruno: 7\n\nFor the first dance of the night, Victor and Karina danced a high-energy salsa right outta of the gate, but is it enough to ensure that the mirror ball trophy will be the jewel in Victor’s triple crown?\n\nWe certainly hope so, because we love this jockey’s moves!\n\nCarrie Ann: 5, Julianne: 5, Bruno: 5\n\nGary, a.k.a. your crazy grandpa did a cha cha for the season opener.\n\nBut, even that wasn’t as entertaining as his post-dance interview.\n\nEverybody hop aboard the Gary Busey because we’re going to the top.\n\nCarrie Ann: 5, Julianne: 5, Bruno: 5\n\nIf Chaka Khan danced the cha cha as well as she sang, or her moves shone as brightly as her glitzy, rhinestone-embellished costume, she’d be more in our favor. The music legend hit a sour note when she forgot a few steps of her routine.\n\nCarrie Ann: 5, Julianne: 4, Bruno: 4\n\nThough she should get extra points for how graciously she took the judge’s critiques.\n\nPaula said that she hasn’t done any sort of organized dancing for 50 years so we can only imagine she greased her joints with butter to start feeling limber again. Paula and her partner did a quickstep to Hey, Good Lookin’ (how appropriate), and it looks like the recipe for her dress called for a healthy serving of grape soda.\n\nIf you’re thinking that Paula looks stiff it’s because she apparently was really scared – like check your drawers scared.\n\nAnd, yes, her scores were kind of bleepy. (Every pun intended).\n\nCarrie Ann: 5, Julianne: 5, Bruno: 5\n\nDressed as Cleopatra, Kim did a salsa to David Guetta and Nicki Minaj’s Hey Mama. She didn’t really have the moves, but what she lacked in rhythm she made up for with fog and mystique.\n\nCarrie Ann: 4, Julianne: 4, Bruno: 4\n\nJulianne said the dance looked like it was in slow motion, and the judges’ criticism sent Kimpatra over the edge.\n\nNow, now! Dry those tears, former Real Housewife of Atlanta/current drama Queen of the Nile. You’re safe – for this week at least. Bindi and Derek and Nick and Sharna top the leaderboard. ABC’s recap show for the first episode of DWTS airs Tuesday at 9/8 p.m. CST.

"But for the last nine months, I've lived a normal life - all thanks to burlesque dancing."\nThe 28-year-old's ME is believed to have been caused by depression and stress, following a childhood tragedy and years of bullying.\nOrphaned when both her parents died when she was two, she was successfully adopted, but the experience left her with emotional scars.\nShe never felt like she fitted in – feelings which intensified when she was bullied at school.\n"I was nicknamed Ski Slope, because of my pale skin and the shape of my nose," she said.\n"Having lost my parents when I was two, I was extremely sensitive and cried a lot, which I was picked on for. So I looked for a form of escapism and turned to ballet.\n"I loved it, I was good at it and I took it seriously. I dreamed of being a professional dancer."\nPosted by Briar Rouge on Monday, 3 August 2015\nBut, when her dance school hopes were dashed, her self esteem plummeted.\n"When I was 16 I applied for dance schools, but because I'd been bullied for so many years I didn't have any confidence in myself," she said.\n"This affected my performances, so I didn't get in. I felt rejected, which left me depressed and put me off dancing."\nFor many years, Bennett hung up her dancing shoes. Then, in 2012, a friend invited her to a burlesque class and she took to the upmarket stripping craze like a duck to water.\nShe said: "It was the first time I'd danced in years, but I loved it and the teacher said I had a talent for it, so I went to classes to learn more and started performing in small bars.\n"My stage name was Briar Rouge and I did fan dances. I danced two to three weekends a month.\n"I loved the glamour of it, the dressing up and how it left women feeling empowered. It was fun."\nSadly, though, last year, Bennett collapsed at work and the ME, or chronic fatigue, diagnosis was made.\nPosted by Briar Rouge on Monday, 3 August 2015\nShe said: "It had been triggered by years of stress and depression – losing my parents, being bullied at school, the job I did. It all caught up with me.\n"For the next year, I had absolutely no energy, so I couldn't work. I was hospitalised for a month.\n"Then I was stuck at home and felt isolated from my friends. I missed dancing and wondered if I'd ever do it again."\nBut, one day, watching videos of other people dancing, she decided her life had been in the doldrums for long enough.\nShe said: "I got jealous, seeing videos of other people doing it. I was frightened that I wouldn't have the courage to do burlesque again, but, finally, I took the bull by the horns and brought Briar Rouge back to life."\nSEE ALSO:\nAmazing Before And After Photographs Of Burlesque Performers\nMeet 'Britain's Biggest Burlesque Dancer' Who Says 'You Don't Have To Be Skinny To Be Sexy'\nOne evening she brought out a pair of feathered fans to do a routine in a bar that was holding a cabaret night.\nRecalling how she felt getting back up on stage, Bennett said: "It was nerve wracking but exciting.\n"I wasn't as fit as I'd been before but it was liberating to be on stage again. I felt alive."\nNow, although Bennett is not completely cured, her ME only flares up every two or three months – lasting at most for a couple of days.\nAnd her foray into burlesque has sparked big plans for the future.\nShe said: "I have signed up with the alternative model agency Ugly, in London and hope to start appearing in magazines and adverts.\n"I am also working as a receptionist now, which is less stressful than my old job and gives me more time to pursue my other interests.\n"I'm doing all sorts of exciting things now and, in an odd way, I owe it to the bullies from school. They made me look for a way to escape and I found it in burlesque."

Shhh.\nMeanwhile, I just finished decorating and coordinating one of my best friend's wedding in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The ceremony took place in Moraine Amphitheater in Estes Park, followed by a beautiful reception in a quaint inn.  Above is a customized kite for the flower (kite) girl. So charming. Wedding pie, anyone? This pie topper may be in the top ten favorite things I've ever made. And that's a lot of things. This is actually one of many weddings I've designed for. If you're interested in customized decor for your big day, shoot me an e-mail at kirsten.studsandpearls [at] gmail.com. I'd love to work with you on your big day!\nXo, Kirsten
0282_217780b3-f3c9-459e-b73f-d2b7c7813852	At his heaviest, Dawn Lerman’s dad was 450 lbs. He tried to lose weight all the time—every week, he engaged in a new diet, some more successful than others, but nothing stuck. \n \n“In every corner of our house, there was no wall space,” Lerman says. “[Each wall] was either lined from floor to ceiling with diet books or shirts that represented my dad’s different weights. There was a pile: 185, 195, 205, 215, 225.” \n \nLerman, a nutrition expert, cooking teacher, and Upper West Side mom-of-two, reflects on her tumultuous childhood relationship with food and how it affected her relationship with her family in her recent memoir, aptly named My Fat Dad . In the book, she describes how her creative family—her mother and sister were actresses, and her father worked in advertising as a writer and creative director, responsible for iconic slogans such as “Leggo My Eggo” and “Fly the Friendly Skies”—was always obsessing over food, but never in a healthy way. Her dad would diet, then maybe eat an entire pizza, then switch diets, while her mom would prepare either processed foods or nothing at all. It was Lerman’s grandmother who showed Lerman that, when prepared correctly, food could be a source of joy rather than stress. \n \nLerman’s grandmother, whom people called Beauty, cooked traditional Jewish meals and encouraged making food into art rather than temporary sustenance. She and Lerman would sit down for meals, and no matter what they’d cooked, it would be set out on a nice plate, perhaps served with tea, and the two would eat “like ladies.” \n \n“My grandmother really drilled it into my head that food is love, food is happiness, [and] everything has to have a smell,”   Lerman says. “If it smells, if it has an aroma—it’s going to transform your world.” \n \nOnce Lerman’s family moved from Chicago when she was 9, and she left Beauty behind, it was harder to stay positive. But Beauty would send recipe cards to Lerman at her new home in New York City. \n \n“My grandmother’s recipe cards saved my life because it kept me from getting in trouble. Every week I had this purpose and this mission,” Lerman says. “I had to go home, I had my recipe cards, I had to cook them for my sister…and I knew I had to take care of myself because nobody else would.” \n \nLerman combined teachings from all the cooks in her life, whether it be Beauty’s “throw it in” style or her baker Aunt Jeannie’s carefully-measured approach, to take care of her own family. Her memories of Jeannie’s healthy “swaps” (like switching butter with applesauce) helped inspire Lerman to start her nutrition awareness program, Magnificent Mommies , which offers workshops to create healthier lifestyles for young children and their adults. \n \nBut despite food’s looming presence in her formative years, Lerman’s path to becoming a nutritionist wasn’t exactly direct. She went through several professions first, including acting, producing commercials, and working as a school drama therapist with kids who suffered from ADHD, depression, and low self-esteem. \n \n“While working at the school, I realized how important proper food choices were,” she says. “I worked with kids on the importance of food choices, made snacks with them, and helped parents to add nutrient-loaded food into their children’s diets and get rid of sugar preservatives and artificial additives.” However, it wasn’t until a couple of years later, when her dad was diagnosed with cancer, that Lerman went back to school to study nutrition. “I realized helping people heal through food choices was my true calling,” she says. \n \nThis creative yet practical approach that Lerman brought to her students guides how she cooks for her own children, as well. On her daughter’s first day of preschool, Lerman noticed how many of her classmates were eating unhealthy snacks. She started a blog, “ Snacking Outside the Box ,” for sharing her healthy recipes and cooking tricks, and started to bring treats into her daughter’s classroom to show that healthy cooking could taste good. \n \n“My daughter went to a preschool on the border of Harlem where many of the kids had never seen edamame or an avocado,” she says. “We made guacamole and edamame hummus. By teaching them to cook, we turned thier yucks into yums.” \n \nAfter her blog gained traction, Lerman tried to sell it as a book idea. But the response she received was largely: “That’s not your story. We want to hear about your family.” So she began writing about growing up with her fat dad for the New York Times’   “Well” blog , and the posts formed the basis for the book. \n \nLerman was a little hesitant to explore her relationship with her father. She sent him chapters after she’d finished writing them so he could look them over, and calls the process “nerve-wracking.” However, her father’s response after reading the book was: “You’ve come a long way baby,” a tagline he’d created for Virginia Slims. \n \nLerman has found that her story resonates with many; she’s received letters from people all over the world who’ve had a grandmother like Beauty or who had a parent who wrestled with extreme dieting. \n \n“My story is everybody’s story, and it could be your story, so the most important thing is trying to create good food memories around your kids, and be aware of the message you send to your children,” Lerman says. “Instill a love for food: For buying food, making food, eating food, and valuing what it does for your body. What we put in our body is how we’re going to live our lives. You’ve got to treat your body well.” \n \nTo learn more about Dawn Lerman, visit  penguin.com ! \n \nThe post appeared first on New York Family Magazine .
0283_625e03de-9bce-4463-8423-67a4556b2cb3	One of the government's most senior ministers has told colleagues to "get on with our jobs" and ignore talk of a sweeping reshuffle that could clear out up to half a dozen ministers. \n\nAbbott government ministers must "get on with our jobs" and ignore talk of a sweeping frontbench reshuffle that could see up to half a dozen ministers moved on by December, Christopher Pyne says.\n\nBut the Education Minister has admitted renewed discussion of a reshuffle will cause further damage to the government's political strategy and messaging, eight days before the critical Canning byelection is held.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has long planned an end of year ministerial shake-up and bringing forward such a move could assist in heading off a leadership challenge, which Liberal MPs have also been discussing in Canberra this week.\n\nThe reshuffle would see older ministers who have also served in the Howard government moved on and young blood like Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Assistant Immigration Minister Michaelia Cash promoted to cabinet.\n\nParliamentary secretaries including Kelly O'Dwyer, Michael McCormack and Christian Porter are tipped to move to the outer ministry.\n\nAnd according to News Corp reports, Defence Minister Kevin Andrews, Employment Minister Eric Abetz and Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane - all of whom served as ministers in the Howard government - could be first in line to go, as could one of the government's star performers, Trade Minister Andrew Robb.\n\nMr Andrews on Thursday suggested Australia would be engaged in fighting the Islamic State for two to three years, an estimate corrected by Mr Abbott later in the day.\n\nMr Pyne told Nine's Today show that reports of a reshuffle were "speculative, they come and go, they take a journalist 10 minutes to write and they do all sorts of distracting damage during the day".\n\n"At the end of the day the Prime Minister chooses who his cabinet and his ministry. All the people you have mentioned are good men doing a good job and the government is getting on with the job," he said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Fairfax Media revealed Mr Abbott was being urged to dump Treasurer Joe Hockey if the Canning byelection goes badly for the Liberal Party, reshuffle his frontbench to reset the government's message and then call a March poll.\n\nMr Abbott dismissed suggestions he was about to dump the Treasurer and said this week that it was his "very strong expectation" that Mr Hockey would deliver a third budget.\n\nMr Pyne said on Friday that Mr Hockey was doing a "fantastic job in very difficult financial circumstances in the world at the moment. He is a great Treasurer. I'm sure his job is absolutely secure. But all of us just have to get on with our jobs".\n\nFairfax Media has spoken to more than a dozen Liberal MPs in the last week about the government's strategy, messaging and it's ambition for economic and industrial relations reforms ahead of the next election.\n\nThere is widespread despondency among Liberal MPs about the government's fortunes - though many were buoyed by Mr Abbott's handling of the decisions to take an additional 12,000 Syrian refugees and extend air strikes against Islamic State into Syria - but here are growing expectations the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge before the end of the year.\n\nA reshuffle would, in theory, help head that move off.\n\nLiberal MPs have not settled on who an alternative leader to Mr Abbott would be, but Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop all feature prominently in discussions about an alternative leadership "ticket" for a new prime minister and treasurer.\n\nSeveral MPs said there was a growing sense on the backbench that a challenge was inevitable if Mr Abbott could not turn the government's fortunes around but unlike in February, the move would have to be made by the frontbench, not the backbench.\n\nOne MP spoke for many when he said the government's problems were "90 per cent the fault of the PMO [Prime Minister's Office]".\n\nFollow James Massola on

0285_05f21032-b4f3-46b8-8204-7eb29f9e6639	Just before the sun came up on Tuesday, Blue Gum Farm at Euroa – like all stud farms across the country – was bracing itself for newborn foals and pregnant mares. Just before the sun came up on Tuesday, Blue Gum Farm at Euroa – like all stud farms across the country – was bracing itself for newborn foals and pregnant mares, with staff members hoping the next three months go smoothly.\n\nIt was September 1, the start of the spring breeding season. The long hours of working out the perfect cross for this mare and that stallion are over. Theory and stud books are put away and sleeves rolled up for months of pregnancy tests and mares bringing new life into the world.\n\nThere are many tell-tale signs farms are looking for in the early months of spring. Heavily in-foal mares begin to drip milk, while dry mares – without foals – begin to come into season.\n\nThe principal of Blue Gum, Phillip Campbell, said from September 1 his stud farm went into full swing.\n\n"There's a lot happening. We've got mares ready for serving or mating, and then you wait and hope for a positive result. It's a long process, and at the same time we have our staff come in when it's dark to monitor all the mares that are pregnant and waiting to give birth," he said.\n\n"They're a specialised team, but you can't stretch your employees around the clock, as 90 per cent of the mares will only give foal in the dark. It's probably nature's way, because they're at their most relaxed at night and there's less chance of predators interfering in their labour.\n\n"It's a ... large operation: first-time mares having foals, former race mares being covered by stallions for the first time, it's very much a hectic time of year."\n\nBlue Gum is no different from breeding establishments across Australasia, with owners of first-time brood mares waiting anxiously for positive pregnancy tests and others eagerly awaiting the birth of foals.\n\nIt is an expensive operation, with owners hoping their filly foal or weanling colt will find group 1 success and make them very wealthy.\n\nThe science behind successful pregnancies and trouble-free births is complex.\n\nVeterinary surgeons remain on hand over these three months.\n\nCampbell said: "There are some extremely expensive mares being covered by extremely valuable stallions.\n\n"There's a lot of time, patience, money and science that goes into it. It's not like the human example of throwing the keys to the car to a young couple and going to the drive-in." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0286_3200ed99-100b-498b-aee0-9a98e1375ac3	Ariana Grande thinks that homophobia is "dumb as f*ck." The singer addressed homophobia during her recent interview with V magazine where she said, "I mean, here’s the thing: I wasn’t raised in a household where it was considered abnormal to be gay. So for me to meet people who use the word 'f*ggot' as an insult, with a derogatory meaning, I can’t take it. I don’t understand it. It’s so foreign to me." \n\nShe continued, "I was raised in a household where being gay was like, the most normal thing. You know, my brother is gay, all of my best friends are gay. When my brother came out of the closet, it wasn’t a big deal for my family. Even my grandpa, who is like, super old-school, was like, ‘Good for you!’ It’s outrageous to me when I see people hate on someone because of their sexuality. I hate the intolerance. I hate the judgment. I hate it so much. Most of my favorite people in my life are gay. It’s something I’m super passionate about, because whenever I would see my friends get bullied, or my brother get hurt for his sexuality, I would become a raging lunatic. I would literally become a raging lunatic because I just can’t take it." \n\nAriana added, "When you see someone you love hurting, for such a superficial, bullsh*t reason, it’s like, how small and spiritually unenlightened and dumb as f*ck can a person be? How much further can your head get up your a** that you’re actually judging someone as a person based on their sexuality before you even have a conversation with them?" \n\nKANYE WEST IS DEFINITELY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT \n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST \n\nSo . . . Kanye West is definitely running for president. The rapper told Vanity Fair about his plans, "When I run for president, I’d prefer not to run against someone. I would be like ‘I want to work with you.’ As soon as I heard Ben Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy. And I think all the people running right now have something that each of the other’s needs. But the idea of this separation and this gladiator battle takes away from the main focus that the world needs help and the world needs all the people in a position of power or influence to come together…" \n\nHe added, "I hate politics. I’m not a politician at all. I care about the truth and I just care about human beings." \n\nHe also spoke on the release of his upcoming album SWISH, saying, "I’m not sure. I’m not worried about the years. I’m worried about the life and the body of work that I can put out while I’m breathing." Fri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST \n\nSelena Gomez has opened up about how her growth has affected the process of her upcoming album, Revival. During an interview with the New York Times, the singer explained, "I was in a relationship, and I was being managed by my parents, and I was still under Hollywood and Disney, and I was being held to this expectation of being the good girl." \n\nSelena even spoke of ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, referencing their parallel success, saying, "While people were writing that I was stupid for being in it, this is what I always saw in him. I’m like, duh!" \n\nOn her friendship with Taylor Swift, Selena said, "Taylor is a lot more trusting than I am. I have trust issues, given my situation. She’s very open, so she brings out this other side of me. \n\nMeanwhile, Taylor told the NY Times, "In the last two years, I’ve seen Selena start to make her career her own. She’s separated her opinion out and prioritized it above anyone else’s. Her childhood was defined by working hard, with the major business decisions primarily being made by others. The coolest part of watching her grow up has been seeing her gradually take the creative reins and start to steer the ship." \n\nTAYLOR SWIFT RANKED ON FORBES' '40 UNDER 40' LIST \n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST \n\nTaylor Swift is the highest-ranked entertainer on Forbes' "40 under 40" list. The mag released the list on Thursday (September 24th), where the top 40 "most influential young people in business" are ranked. However, this list was "100 percent brand new," which meant that in order to be ranked, you could not have been featured on previous "40 under 40" lists. \n\nTaylor placed number six on the list, with Forbes saying, "The country crooner turned pop mega-star was the single highest-earning musician last year, but that’s not what earned her the respect and attention of the business world. It was her surprising and effective public stance against free music." \n\nOther celebs to make the list include John Oliver, Jessica Alba and Ronda Rousey. \n\nAdam Neumann -- the 36-year-old founder and CEO of WeWork received the top spot on the list. \n\nCHRIS BROWN RESPONDS TO AUSTRALIA BAN STORY \n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST \n\nChris Brown has denied reports that activists in Australia are trying to ban him from entering their country for a concert in December because of his 2009 incident with Rihanna. The singer posted the story, along with the caption, "THIS STORY IS FALSE AND ILL BE IN AUSTRALIA IN DECEMBER. To all the fans , don’t listen or be discouraged to buy tickets. My presales tickets sold out in the first 2 minutes." \n\nHe also blasted TMZ, who originally reported the story, saying, "It's fake. TMZ just tries to stop my paper." \n\nJAY Z DOESN'T WANT HIS $150 MILLION LIVE NATION DEAL MENTIONED IN 'BIG PIMPIN'' CASE \n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST \n\nSandra Rose has reported that Jay Z returned to court to plead with the judge over his "Big Pimpin'" lawsuit to keep the deets of his $150 million Live Nation deal under wraps. According to the site, Jay claims that disclosing the terms of his new deal could interfere with future negotiations with other companies. \n\nThe rapper recently filed docs in the case, demanding that his past run-ins with the law not be allowed to be discussed in the courtroom. Jay says that the man suing him -- whose name is Osama Ahmed Fahmy, mentioned bringing up his criminal past during the trial. Jay also said that mentioning his run-ins with the law is "absurd" because he hasn't had a criminal conviction in the past 10 years, nor does the current case have anything to do with his criminal past. \n\nThe rapper also requested that his net worth not be allowed to be mentioned in court, claiming that the only reason to inform the jury of his finances is to make them biased and give the plaintiff a larger amount of money in damages. \n\nJay pleaded with the judge regarding his Live Nation deal earlier this week, saying that the agreement contains sensitive financial information regarding his business relationship with the company. The 80-page agreement shows the calculations of Jay's earnings for each concert. \n\nJay also says that Live Nation upholds strict confidentiality of their artist agreements and that minimal employees have access to those documents. \n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST \n\nZAYN MALIK POSTS CRYPTIC TWEET TOWARDS PERRY EDWARDS?: Did Zayn Malik post a cryptic tweet towards his ex-fiance Perry Edwards?

0288_e04b1c3f-1cc2-42bf-a4c7-2dc3e6180a06	Haven't been reading much lately but bought Žižek's book of jokes. It gets crude, interesting that he points out jokes are anonymous and will have some reasoning behind them say to let off steam in regard to issues with authorities etc. Why I thought I would have a look was that after reading a pretty difficult book by Žižek the one part I remembered was a joke and I really laughed out loud on the bus. There were a few moments like this with the current book but a lot of the jokes were archival say of Soviet era politics, religion and so forth. This is a joke that wasn't particularly funny but I liked it, a man is crazy and thinks he is a kernel of grain. If he sees a chicken he becomes terrified as they love feasting on such morsels. The therapists try their best to convince the man that he is not a kernel of grain but a man and after a while succeed curing him of his delusion. One day though the man sees a chicken and becomes terrified, going into a panic. When the therapists arrive they point out that he is cured and is in fact a man. The man replies 'I know I am a man......but does the chicken?'. So there you go, a bad joke but it has an interesting side to it and there a couple of variations in relation to commodity fetishism etc. The point that Žižek makes is that it is fine to make the patient aware of the unconscious in psychoanalysis but when does the unconscious become aware of itself? In regard to creating self aware systems which is at the vanguard of current technological pursuits, say for instance Google's self driving cars. We have as well NASA testing drones for possible space missions which will be able to make decisions in regard to what they explore as the gap in real time human operation will be too great. It is interesting watching these ideas and technologies unfold but at the same time it is hard to completely trust technology especially when it becomes able to direct itself in difficult terrain such as deep space. What really worries me though is the malfunctioning driver less car but really what is the difference? Technology can become its own bad driver and we can throw in a loud speaker for some road rage.

He was 90. \n \nThe Hall of Famer and three-time Most Valuable Player died of "natural causes" late Tuesday, the museum said in a statement. \n \n"Yogi conducted his life with unwavering integrity, humility and a contagious good humor that elevated him from baseball legend to beloved national icon," the museum said. \n \nBerra, a 15-time All Star and 10-time World Series champion, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1972. \n \nBut the baseball great was equally well-known for humorous quips and malapropisms such as "It's deja vu all over again." \n \nOthers include such one-liners as "It ain't over till it's over" and "When you come to a fork in the road, take it." \n \nMajor League Baseball columnist Marty Noble said on the league's online news page that "a loss that unquestionably transcends the game has sent all of baseball into deep mourning." \n \nBerra's museum announced his death "with a profound sense of loss and heartfelt sorrow." \n \nHis family added that "while we mourn the loss of our father, grandfather and great-grandfather, we know he is at peace with Mom." \n \n  More from AFP:   Swiss Re to buy Guardian Financial Services for £1.6 bn    Chinese firms sign deal to buy 300 Boeing planes: Xinhua    Obama to offer pope heartfelt White House welcome    Barcelona, the jewel in Catalan independence crown    No 'Happy Birthday' for Warner: US judge rules

0292_c9f9983f-4034-48f0-88f8-74ea088f9efa	Los Angeles: Defenceman Slava Voynov, who pleaded no contest to domestic violence charges in July, has severed ties with the Los Angeles Kings and plans to return to his native Russia. \n\nVoynov’s decision to begin the process of trying to leave comes in the aftermath of his legal troubles in the US, which included being sentenced to 90 days in jail and probation stemming from an October 2014 fight with his wife. \n\n“Earlier today, I notified the National Hockey League, the National Hockey League Players’ Association and the Los Angeles Kings of my decision to immediately begin the formal process of returning to Russia with my family,” said Voynov in a statement on Wednesday. \n\n“I sincerely apologise to those in and around the game of hockey who have been affected by my situation.” \n\nHis statement comes one day before the Kings had planned to officially terminate his contract. \n\n“Mr. Voynov has been in the custody of the Seal Beach Detention Center and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement [since the plea on July 2],” the Kings said on Wednesday. \n\n“During this period of detention, the Los Angeles Kings decided he would no longer play for the team. \n\n“The method by which we would ensure this outcome was something we carefully considered and we established a deadline of September 17 — the beginning of our 2015-16 training camp — to reach this outcome. \n\n“Recently it became evident to us that our conclusion to this process would be to terminate Mr. Voynov’s Standard Player’s Contract. However, Mr. Voynov’s announcement today of his intention to leave the United States and return to Russia makes the termination unnecessary.” \n\nVoynov’s decision to leave must still be approved by immigration officials. He was facing possible deportation after being taken into custody earlier this month by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n\nVoynov still had four years and $19.2 million (Dh70.62 million) left on his contract with the Kings. \n\nVoynov won two Stanley Cup titles with the Kings in 2012 and 2014. He was one of the Kings’ top four defencemen and scored 18 goals and 81 points in 190 games spanning four seasons with Los Angeles.

0294_29d0c69c-8c45-4fae-bbaf-2cf7a02421ff	LAWTON, MI - Lawton football coach Tony Karsen said his team needed some adversity.  \n\nThrough four games, the Blue Devils were hardly tested, winning each contest by at least 20 points and rolling to a 4-0 record.  \n\nOn Friday, Lawton got their first true test of the season, and made just enough plays to pass, hanging on for a 30-27 win over Gobles in the MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette Game of the Week.  \n\nAfter roaring out to a 23-0 lead late in the second quarter, the Blue Devils (5-0, 2-0 SAC-Central) gave up 27-straight points to the Tigers (3-2, 1-2 SAC-Central) and found themselves down 27-23 with 6:25 left in the fourth. A blocked punt helped spur the offense, which drove 59 yards, including a fourth and sixth conversion from their own 45, to retake the lead 30-27. Needing a final defensive stand, the Blue Devils forced an incomplete pass on fourth and eight from their own 49 to preserve the win.  \n\n“We needed to get socked in the mouth at least once at some point in this season and see how we respond to that hit,” Karsen said. “We knew it was going to be a battle for four quarters, and our boys picked it up when it mattered.” \n\nThe win keeps the Blue Devils in the race for the Southwestern Athletic Conference title. It also means that next week’s game against Schoolcraft (5-0) will be for first place in the division and will lock up a playoff berth for the winner.  \n\nThe Blue Devils opened up the scoring early on Gobles. On the second play from scrimmage, quarterback Derek Leighton faked a handoff up the middle and took the ball to the outside. He found the edge and got some blocking from wide receiver Jarod Wimes for a 73-yard touchdown run. Leighton said they had been saving that play for the right occasion.  \n\n“That might have been the first designed run I’ve had all season,” Leighton said. “I don’t experience open grass like that. Jarod Wimes had a great block. The offensive line did their job. It was a great fake up the middle.” \n\nOn Gobles first drive, the Tigers moved the ball well, going 66 yards in seven plays to get the ball down to the Lawton 14, but a fumble on the quarterback exchange gave the ball back to the Blue Devils. Gobles forced a punt, but the Gobles returner couldn’t hold onto the ball and Lawton’s Dakota Raterink recovered at the Gobles 21. Gobles fumbled the ball four times in the first half, with Lawton recovering three. Tigers’ coach Jim Wiseley said giving the ball away really cost his team.   \n\n“In big games, you can’t do that. A couple of (the turnovers) were mental mistakes and two of them were effort, and you hate to blame effort, but the kids were going for extra yards and put the ball on the ground,” Wiseley said.  \n\nFollowing the fumble recovery, Lawton ran four straight times capped by a three-yard touchdown plunge by Raterink. Raterink, a senior, was all over the field for the Blue Devils on Friday, recovering two fumbles, rushing the ball 12 times for 52 yards and a touchdown, catching two passes for 96 yards and blocking a punt.  \n\nAfter trading possessions, Gobles once again gave the football away, with Lawton recovering another fumble at the Tigers’ 39. Once again, the Blue Devils were able to put points on the board, with Wimes knocking home a 29-yard field goal.  \n\nAfter moving the ball 64 yards on their next drive, Gobles elected to go for it on fourth down from the Lawton 16, but were stuffed short. Lawton took advantage of the change of possession. On third down, Leighton found Raterink down the sideline for a 69 yard gain. Two plays later, Leighton hit Wimes in the flat for a 13-yard touchdown catch as the Blue Devils extended their lead to 23-0. Wimes finished with four receptions for 29 yards and ran the ball twice for eight yards.  \n\nWith time ticking away before the end of the half, Gobles found some hope. Putting together a ten-play drive, the Tigers were able to pick up big chunks of yardage on the ground. The drive was capped by a Travis Chandler two-yard touchdown run with eight seconds left in the second quarter. Wiseley said that was a big swing for them right before the break.  \n\n“Just scoring points at that point was big, we knew we had a large deficit,” Wiseley said. “We knew once we got into halftime and made the adjustments we needed to make we would be all right.” \n\nIn the second half, the Tigers took just 1:23 to march the ball down the field and cut the deficit to 23-14. Tyler Fuhrman took the ball straight up the middle for 53 yards for the score.   \n\nOn its first drive of the second half, Lawton stalled after picking up one first down and was forced to punt. Again, the Gobles offense found rhythm and this time it was Mason Lawson’s turn to make a big play. The senior fullback broke a 50-yard touchdown run. The point after was blocked, but Gobles was down three and had momentum on its side.  \n\nThe Tigers forced a three-and-out on Lawton’s next offensive possession. Not showing any signs of slowing down, the Tigers picked up 52 yards in seven plays and took their first lead of the game with 1:05 left in the third quarter on Chandler’s second score of the night. Chandler, a sophomore, finished with 131 yards on 24 carries and two touchdowns.  \n\n“Our kids were shellshocked for a bit, but you settle in, you stay composed and you trust your schemes and you trust each other,” Karsen said of the mood on the sideline. “Gobles is physical, they get off the ball well, they’re very disciplined with their offensive scheme and their defense. We knew it was going to be physical verse physical.” \n\nLeighton said the Blue Devils were throwing everything they had at the Tigers.  \n\n“It was a difficult time,” Leighton said. “We were doing everything we could, we had every formation and we couldn’t stop them.”  \n\nAnother three-and-out by the Lawton offense gave Gobles a chance to extend its lead with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Despite running 11 plays and holding onto the ball for more than five minutes, the Tigers were forced to punt for the first time in the second half with 6:25 left in the game. Lawton took advantage of the opportunity, blocking the kick and taking over at the Gobles 41.  \n\n“Special teams is instant momentum,” Karsen said. “Our kids made a great play and that gave new life to our offense and we were able to capitalize.” \n\nThe Blue Devils used the passing game to pick up chunks of yardage, including Leighton finding Wimes on fourth down to extend the drive. On the next play, Raterink took a crossing route 27 yards to get down to the Gobles 11. Three plays later, he finished the drive with his second touchdown run of the night. Leighton finished the game 8-for-10 for 125 yards and a touchdown.  \n\n“We really had to pick it up, that was really a test of manhood right there,” Leighton said. “We manned up in that fourth quarter.” \n\nGobles got the ball back at its own 20 and were able to get to midfield, but incomplete passes on third and fourth down ended the Tigers hope for a comeback. Karsen said he trusted his defense on that final drive.  \n\n“I’m extremely confident in our defense,” Karsen said. “I’ve been in this position many times over the past ten years and they just step up. It’s a matter of staying composed and doing your assignment and winning the ball game.” \n\nWiseley said turnovers marred what was otherwise an impressive performance by his squad.  \n\n“Our kids fought,” Wiseley said. “We scored 20 points, gave up one touchdown the entire second half. Lawton rose up and scored to win it, but I’m proud of our kids.”  \n\nLawton now turns its attention to Schoolcraft and readies for another big game next week. Karsen said he will enjoy this victory tonight, but tomorrow his attention turns to Schoolcraft.  \n\n“I’m going to enjoy it tonight and tomorrow night it’s back to working orders.”

0296_deb0ca97-294d-470e-ae8e-8a2003e8d1e5	NEW DELHI: Both Sensex and Nifty recorded their fresh 52-week lows on Friday amid nervousness over an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve later this month and fears of global slowdown gripped markets.\n\nTechnical charts indicate further weakness, and chances are that the market could well slip by another 4-5 per cent before some base is formed for the market to move higher.

We will suggest new investors to stay away from market for the time being till some recovery is seen. Existing investors should wait for a further 4-5 per cent correction, and then add positions from those levels," said Rohit Gadia, founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research.\n\nHowever, for investors this volatility can be a great opportunity to accumulate quality stocks with an investment horizone of over a year, as the bull run still remains intact.The market has wiped out all the gains made in calendar year 2015, weighed down by global jitters like EU (Greece) turmoil, uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve rate hike and China jitters, among others."India is not decoupled and may face the brunt of the global issues and may be riskoff in the near future if Fed raises rates. Consensus earnings expectation has gone down to 10 per cent for FY16," said Siddharth Sedani, Assistant Vice President - Advisory at Sharekhan.\n\n"Many positive macros make us believe that Indian equities are very attractive in this gloomy situation. Lower commodity prices (crude and base metals), low and steady inflation (CPI) and a possible interest rate cut along with GST and other reforms can help the domestic economy," he said.Sedani advises investors that post kneejerk reactions in the market, the slowdown in China is a blessing in disguise for Indian equity. "So we would advise investors to be stock-specific and go for bargain hunting for a medium- to long-term perspective."The benchmark indices slipped over 6 per cent each as domestic factors like lower-than-expected GDP growth in Q1 of FY16 and higher rainfall deficit for August added to the woes. Even though most of the brokerage firms have slashed their year-end targets for Sensex, some see good upside in next 12 months.\n\n"Going ahead, we expect Sensex EPS to grow at 13.2 per cent and 18.5 per cent in FY16E and FY17E to Rs 1,539 and Rs 1,838, respectively," ICICI Securities said in a note.\n\n"Hence, we assign a PE multiple of 16.5 times on FY17E EPS to arrive at a fair value of 30,300 by September 2016 with Nifty reaching 9,200," the brokerage said.We have collated a list of 10 stocks, which investors can look at buying on dips for a period of over 1 year:\n\nPidilite Industries\n\nPidilite is a dominant play in India's growing adhesive and industrial chemical market with a market share of 70 per cent in its leading brand categories in the organised segment. Its two major segments, consumer & bazaar (C&B) and speciality industrial chemical have grown at a CAGR of 20 per cent and 15 per cent (standalone), respectively, in FY10-14. ICICI Securities estimates lower revenue CAGR of 11 per cent while a sharp margin expansion of 500 bps for FY15- 17E which may be supported by benign raw material prices. Also, a recovery in margin coupled with strong return ratios would justify the company's current valuation. They believe that the stock is a potential candidate for re-rating considering its ability to maintain its market share and enjoy the benefit of lower raw material prices. Mahindra & Mahindra\n\nM&M has clearly highlighted that FY16E would be an aggressive launch year, which has already begun with the launch of new XUV500 and the small commercial vehicle Jeeto.Within the utility vehicle (UV) space, the company is expected to launch two new platforms in the compact UV segment-TUV 300 (true blue UV) & S101 (crossover UV). Owing to a well-diversified product mix, strong pan-India presence & cost-efficient operations, M&M has retained its leadership in domestic tractor industry and maintained its market share over 40 per cent since acquisition of Swaraj Tractors in FY09.\n\nM&M has been one of the worst hit incumbent OEMs in FY15E with problems ranging from loss of market share on the automotive side in H1 to the sudden decline in FES business in H2. However, the ability to sustain profitability at a respectable level amid all the aforesaid pressures demonstrates business and management strength.\n\nTimken India\n\nTimken India has forayed into gear repair services with the Raipur facility. The management pegs the opportunity in the segment, currently served by unorganised players, at Rs 2500 crore in India, wherein it is looking to garner up to 15 per cent market share in the medium to long term.Furthermore, DFC implementation would also provide an incremental bearing market opportunity of Rs 500 crore led by incremental ordering of new wagons. Timken with a 50 per cent market share would be a key beneficiary.\n\nGiven the leadership in the tapered bearings led by strong parentage, robust balance sheet and strong earning CAGR (32.3 per cent over FY15-17E), Timken is one of our top picks in the bearings segment with a proxy play on both Railways investment uptick and repairs business potential.\n\nBharat Forge\n\nBharat Forge (BFL) is a leading global automotive forgings supplier, boasting top-5 global OEMs as customers. CV business is 55-60 per cent of the consolidated business and remains a key driver for overall growth.BFL expects the truck segment in the US market to remain strong till FY17. On the domestic side, BFL is a clean play on a recovery of the domestic CV cycle as it commands over 60 per cent market share in M&HCV components.\n\nBFL looks set to increase capacity & utilisation in coming years as the management aims at Rs 7,000 crore standalone revenue by FY18E. These factors will keep both margins as well as revenue growth above industry trend.\n\nICICI Securities is of the view that BFL's business franchise is unique and provides investors great opportunity to own one of the few India listed globally ancillary suppliers.\n\nVoltas\n\nVoltas is primarily an assembler of ACs with outsourcing component and assembles in its Pantnagar plant (Uttarakhand). The segment contributes 39 per cent to the consolidated topline and recorded sales CAGR of 16 per cent during FY10-15.A strong brand coupled with over 6500 dealers has helped Voltas to improve its market share from 14 per cent in FY10 to 20.3 per cent in FY15.Given the relatively stable margin and high operating cash flow, the government's thrust on infrastructure development demand growth in UCP segment has provided strong support to Voltas' profitability with lower working capital requirement.The company commands strong RoCE of the UCP segment in the range of ~40-43 per cent over the last four years.\n\nResearch Firm: ​Edelweiss\n\nCholamandalam Investment \n\nIt is a retail finance company, promoted by Murugappa group, with focus on vehicle finance and loan against property. Vehicle finance constitutes 69 per cent of its AUM, and home equity constitutes 29 per cent of AUM.\n\nWithin vehicle finance, the focus is on small road transport operators, and within home equity, 89 per cent of loan is against self occupied residential property.\n\nCompany has 534 branches (90 per cent in Tier II, Tier III and Tier IV towns). CV sales growth over last 2 years was worst in 10 years. There will be growth due to uptick in pent up demand.\n\nThe company is adding new lines of business like tractor financing, rural financing, SME financing, both working capital and term loan.\n\nDCB Bank\n\nThe new management is undertaking broad based transformation with higher focus on profitability, asset quality and balance sheet health. Focus is now shifted to retail mortgages, SME, agri loans and lesser advances to stressed corporate to lead to strong stable advances growth.\n\nThe management has also strengthen risk management practices (no large ticket accounts and green field funding and higher collateral lending). Expansion strategy in tier II - tier IV cities where they are already present (cluster approach) will lead to lower operating costs and higher return ratios\n\nStrong retail deposit base and focus on higher CASA will give access to stable low cost funding.\n\nIndo Count Industries\n\nIt is the third largest exporter of Home Textiles (bed linen); 20 per cent market share. Global Home Textile Market is currently valued at $86bn (2015) and is expected to grow to $96bn by 2017.\n\nThe company has competitive advantage over competitors due to cotton surplus status, favorable cost dynamics, skilled labour advantage and supportive government policies & subsidies.\n\nShift in Home Textiles market from China to India due to wage inflation and Yuan appreciation in China will benefit the company. Shift in Product mix towards high margin Home Textiles business (20 per cent margins) from low margin Spinning business (5-7 per cent margins) will aid growth.\n\nThe company has forayed into newer geographies and also newer segments with a total market size of $9bn such as Fashion, Utility and Institutional Bedding.\n\nNatco Pharma\n\nThe company is a focused R&D play in Oncology, CNS and other niche therapies. The current opportunity of $15 bn of the drugs known filed ANDA's in the US Market.\n\nThere is strong revenue visibility due to - Copaxone launch on the anvil (3 Bn USD); other US filings equally lucrative: (Revlimid $4 Bn, Tracleer $1.5 Bn, Tamiflu $600 Mn, Vidaza $300 Mn); Sovaldi (Hepatitis C) to be a game changer (100 mn patients in 91 EM).\n\nPokarna\n\nPokarna exports granites and quartz to over 69 countries. Global counter top market is $81bn; with Quartz at a mere 8bn i.e.10 per cent market share offering immense growth potential.\n\nUS and Canada at 24 per cent are the biggest markets for Counter top yet Quartz is grossly underpenetrated in these markets. Shift in consumer interest from other Counter top materials such as Laminates (market share of 16 per cent currently) towards Quartz is fueling growth.Quartz is growing faster than counter top market. From 1999-14 quartz segmetn grew at CAGR of 15.8 per cent while counter top grew at CAGR of 4.4 per cent.\n\nShift in Pokarna's product mix towards high margin Quartz segment from traditional Granite segment will help margin growth. Quartz reported 32 per cent EBITDA margin with 42 per cent contribution to Total Revenues, whereas Granite reported 22 per cent margins with 56 per cent contribution to Total Revenues.\n\nCurrently Pokarna has less than 5 per cent market share in the US Quartz market.\n\nCompany is expanding its distribution reach in order to expand its presence in key counter top regions such as North America and in Europe. Granite business segment to continue growing at a steady pace.\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of EconomicTimes.com.

0297_9098939d-7744-413a-9a9a-1e155f7d43d7	ATLANTA -- Filmmaker Tyler Perry paid homage to the late Bobbi Kristina Brown through a tribute video that was shown during her private funeral in August. \n \nPerry wrote in a Facebook post Friday that the Houston estate asked him to share the 3-minute plus video featuring the 22-year-old daughter of the late Whitney Houston. Bobbi Kristina died in hospice care July 26 after she was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub in her suburban Atlanta townhome Jan. 31. \n \nBobbi Kristina was the only child between Houston and R&B singer Bobby Brown. She was buried in New Jersey next to Houston. \n \nHouston died in a similar fashion. She was found face-down in a foot of water in her bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel just before the 2012 Grammy Awards. Authorities found prescription drugs in the suite and evidence of heart disease and cocaine in her body but determined her death was an accidental drowning. \n \nBobbi Kristina was found in the townhome she shared with Nick Gordon, an orphan three years older than her, whom Houston had raised as her own. Bobbi Kristina referred to him as her husband. \n \nA police report earlier this year described the incident as a drowning, and authorities are investigating her death. \n \nPerry was among a handful of notables, including Grammy-winning R&B singer Monica and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who showed up for Bobbi Kristina's funeral last month. \n \nPerry said she had a future as an actress after her debut on his TV show "For Better or Worse" in 2012, but she only appeared in one episode. Aside from two ill-fated reality TV shows and the occasional paparazzi video, her image mostly showed up in the "selfies" she posted online. \n \nBobbi Kristina grew up in the shadow of her famous parents. She appeared with them in 2005 on the Bravo reality show "Being Bobby Brown" and attended award shows with her mother and father. \n \nThe video shows photos of Bobbi Kristina as a baby, posing alongside her parents and as an adult. As each picture flashes across the screen, her mother's song "You Were Loved" played. \n \nThe video ended with the words, "Goodbye for now."
0298_772dc52c-1f9f-4bb9-8454-8fdd988ac949	OWATONNA — It’s been several years since Shannon Kerr moved away from Owatonna, but she still has many friends and connections in town. \n  \nAnd since Sept. 14, when Shannon and her two daughters were injured in a serious car crash in Dakota County, those friends have been coming out of the woodwork to share their love and support to the family. \n \n“We’ve had amazing support of people just coming up and sitting with us, making the day not so long,” said Shannon’s mother, Shelly McCauley. “We go to Northridge Church, and the support from there, and Bethel had a prayer service … The hospital said they have never seen an outpouring of support like we have had.” \n \nMore than a week after the crash, Shannon and her eldest daughter, Kyra, 7, remain in the hospital in intensive care. Her younger daughter Jaydaline, 4, also was injured but was released from the hospital after two days. The family now lives in Lakeville. \n \n“Shannon is still in a coma,” McCauley said. “She’s still got a lot of swelling [in her brain], so she just needs to rest more and the swelling needs to go down. She’s holding her own, she’s stable, so we’re praying for a miracle here.” \n \nKyra, meanwhile, is showing major signs of improvement, and McCauley said one doctor said she might be moved to the pediatric unit later this week. \n \n“Kyra is doing awesome. She’s awake and alert and knows all of us, so we just praise the Lord for that,” McCauley said. “She was on the side of the truck, so she took the biggest brunt of it, so for her to be where she is today is really a miracle.” \n \nThe crash took place early on the morning of the 14th when the Toyota Sienna driven by Shannon Kerr, traveling eastbound on 280th Street/Country Road 86 in Dakota County, was struck broadside by a semi truck northbound on Highway 3 driven by Scott Suess of Apple Valley. Suess also was injured in the crash, while his passenger, John Thomas of Dundas, reported no injury. \n \nMinnesota State Patrol Lieutenant Tiffani Schweigart said Wednesday the crash remains under investigation while a complete crash reconstruction is underway. The intersection is controlled by stop signs for east-west traffic, she said. \n \nBut the details of the crash don’t matter that much to McCauley, who spends much of her time since the crash at her daughter's and granddaughter's bedsides at Hennepin County Medical Center. \n \n“This is where I am with my baby girl and my Kyra, my granddaughter, so we just do what we can every day to make it as comfortable as we can for them,” she said. \n \nIn addition to keeping vigil over Shannon and Kyra — “Kyra hasn’t been left for a minute,” McCauley says — the family and friends are posting updates on a CaringBridge website run by family friend Kristi Hedstrom. The site has become a touchstone for hundreds of friends, acquaintances and even strangers to reach out in support for the family, and for the family to reach back to them. Dan McCauley, Shannon’s brother, took to the site the day after the crash to tell well-wishers a little more about his sister, and about her three younger brothers, her husband, Jason, and her four children. \n \n“Shannon truly cares about people,” he wrote. “Shannon would be praying for you and your family right now if you were in her shoes. … She is a very strong Christian and loves the Lord.” \n \nThat faith is what’s sustaining the entire family, Shelly McCauley said. \n \n“We’re a very, very solid Christian family, so when we are weak, our Lord is strong, so that’s what we hold onto every day,” she said. “… Every day, he gives us something to hold onto, so that’s where our whole strength is right now.” \n \nShannon graduated from Owatonna High School, where she was a standout athlete in basketball, volleyball and track, according to Dan McCauley. Wendell Engelstad, a friend of the family who lived next door when she was growing up, remembers her excelling on the court but also for her kindness and compassion. \n \n“[They are a] very Christian, caring family, all of them. All the kids are the same way,” he said. \n \nDan McCauley said Wednesday that their faith gives them hope of a full recovery for his sister. \n \n“It all comes down to prayer,” he said. “Shannon will come through, and we’ll be talking to Shannon soon.” \n \nUntil then, Shannon’s family and friends will continue to watch, and wait, and pray. \n \n“It’s not a good place to be, so we’re just relying on the Lord, and he’s been amazing every day,” Shelly McCauley said. “We’ve had so many miracles since these things happened. ... Just hold us up in prayer, that’s all we ask.” \n   \nWilliam Morris is a reporter for the Owatonna People's Press.

0299_1edac5ac-f042-4eec-9a1c-0f2abcb9c9a7	_ TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 09/21/15 -- Torex Gold Resources Inc. (the "Company" or "Torex") (TSX: TXG) is pleased to announce that its 100% owned subsidiary Minera Media Luna, S.A. de C.V. ("MML") has signed a letter of intent ("LOI") with the Ministry of Public Safety of the State Government of Guerrero (the "Ministry"), endorsed by the Federal Government, for the provision of permanent police presence in the areas adjacent to the Company's Morelos Gold Property in southwest Mexico. \n\nFred Stanford, President and CEO of Torex stated: "Our team has been working collaboratively with the Mexican State and Federal Governments to establish a long-term program to provide security to the communities in and around our El Limon-Guajes (ELG) Mine and the Media Luna Project. This letter of intent is the first step in establishing a pilot program between the government and the private sector to provide security conditions that are conducive to economic development and social stability in the area." \n\nIn the first stage of the pilot program, the Ministry will establish three check points with permanent police presence which, along with regular patrols, will control access to the communities in the areas adjacent to our ELG Mine. The Media Luna Project, will receive some security benefits from this pilot program, with more comprehensive coverage planned for later programs. MML will support the program with infrastructure including lodging for the police force, and goods and services in the form of transportation and vehicle maintenance. The program will come into effect immediately upon settling and signing a formal agreement on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the parties and may be renewed on a yearly basis by agreement of the parties. It is the vision of the program to extend its influence to the entire Guerrero Gold Belt in the future through similar agreements with other mining companies operating in Guerrero. \n\nTorex is a growth-oriented, Canadian-based resource company engaged in the exploration and development of its 100% owned Morelos Gold Property, an area of 29,000 hectares in the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt located 180 kilometers southwest of Mexico City. Within this property, Torex has two projects: the El Limon-Guajes (ELG) Mine, currently under development, and the Media Luna Project, at an advanced stage of exploration. Torex intends to identify a pipeline of future economic deposits within its property, which remains 75% unexplored. \n\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis press release contains "forward-looking statements" and "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.

It will not be a lengthy session this evening. I'm just doing a little while my wife catches up on Great British Menu. I'm 328 words into this section and mainly just talking about rain. As I live in England it's a subject I feel I am something of an expert on. Not in the same range as the Scots with snow - I read this week they have 421 for snow.

0303_0b06bd45-a1b1-4a20-a3cb-7fe53e87b897	In short, the same ol’ same plagued Tampa Bay this week ― the pitching staff wasn’t able to hold the leads they were given. Consider this: the Rays are now 18-31 in games decided in the seventh inning or later, and they have either held a lead or came back to tie the score in 12 of their last 14 losses. Nevertheless, they still endeavored. \nAs with any good win probability graph, the past week was chock full of ups and downs for the Tampa Bay Rays. And though they were in every game, with the exception of Saturday’s less than stellar shellacking at the hands of the Boston Red Sox, the Rays only came away with two tallies in the win column. Ouch.\n\nIn short, the same ol’ same plagued Tampa Bay this week ― the pitching staff wasn’t able to hold the leads they were given. Consider this: the Rays are now 18-31 in games decided in the seventh inning or later, and they have either held a lead or came back to tie the score in 12 of their last 14 losses. Nevertheless, they still endeavored.\n\nHere’s your weekly Rays recap.\nMonday\n\nDrew Smyly took the mound against his former team on Labor Day, and allowed the long ball to get the best of him. That’s not to say he started the game poorly, rather Smyly tossed two excellent innings to start the game. The lefty spotted his fastball well, especially up in the zone, and paired it with his off-speed stuff at the bottom of the zone ― racking up a couple strikeouts, while giving up a pair of hits up the middle.\n\nYet in the third inning, he surrendered a soft double near the left-field line to Anthony Gose, then left a letter high 1-2 slider to Rajai Davis, who deposited it over the wall in left-field. In a bout of déjà vu, Nick Castellanos led off Detroit’s half of the fifth inning with a double on another hanging slider, and James McCann crushed an errant cutter to left, putting Le Tigre up by two.\n\nIn spite of Evan Longoria and JP Arencibia’s homers, which allowed the team to knot the game at four, Brandon Gomes hung a slider to Davis which found a new home in the left field stands.\n\nTampa Bay didn’t get a runner into scoring position until the ninth against the Tigers bullpen, and by that point it was too late. The Rays fell 5-4.\n\nOn the bright side of things, Logan Forsythe was named the AL player of the week. Forsythe hit .545 (12-22) with five runs scored, five doubles, one triple, and two walks in six games the week prior.\nTuesday\n\nTuesday featured more of the same, although with 100% more extra innings baseball. Erasmo Ramirez got the start for the Rays, and aside from a third inning solo shot off the bat of Rajai Davis, the righty sailed through the front five on just 72 pitches (a little more than 14 pitches per inning). Ramirez racked up nine strikeouts (six whiffs) in that time, while allowing three base runners on three hits. The happy one’s change-up was really working for him, and he made a couple of the Tigers’ big boppers ― namely Ian Kinsler and Miguel Cabrera ― look foolish on a pair of well located off-speed offerings.\n\nTampa Bay took a 5-1 lead in the sixth. Kevin Kiermaier worked a leadoff walk off Matt Boyd, and J.P. Arencibia moved him to third on a single to right. Grady Sizemore both drove in a run and moved Arencibia to third on a single to right. Tampa Bay scored three more runs on singles by Longoria, Logan Forsythe, and Tim Beckham. The lead, however, was short lived.\n\nThe wheels fell off for Ramirez in the fourth after he allowed three consecutive hard hit singles to Anthony Gose, Kinsler, and Cabrera. Erasmo got yanked in favor of Matt Andriese, who walked in Martinez after a nine pitch at-bat. Andriese has now allowed 12 runs (11 earned) in seven appearances and 10-1/3 innings since August 19th. Why Cash chose to go with him in this situation is well beyond the realm of my understanding.\n\nThe Rays had a lead when Alex Colome took the mound with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth. Colome put down Nick Castellanos looking, then hit James McCann in the head by a pitch, plating a run. He then gave up a two-run single to left, allowing Detroit to knot the game at five. Longoria was apparently unaware that the runner had stopped on the play. He cut off the throw from Sizemore to the plate, and never noticed that the runner stopped halfway between home and third. He, instead, caught McCann in a rundown between second and third, consequently allowing a run to score.\n\nThe scoring went back and forth and Tampa Bay eventually took a 7-7 tie into extras. They, however, walked away with an 8-7 loss in 13 innings after Davis hit a sac-fly into left. OF Grady Sizemore made with a Little League worthy throw to the cutoff man (Longoria) in an attempt to force a play at the plate. But alas the throw wasn’t competitive, and the winning run crossed the plate. The loss in extras became the 10th consecutive for Tampa Bay, the most in a single season since the Houston Astros dropped 11 in 2012.\nWednesday\n\nFret not Rays’ fans, the boys ended a disappointing 4-5 road trip with an impressive 8-0 win over Detroit. Up by three in the sixth, Tampa Bay extended its lead in the after Logan Forsythe and Tim Beckham hit a pair of homers, chasing. For Beckham, 49% of his hits this season have gone for extra bases. Not one to be left out from the hit show, J.P. Arencibia belted a seventh inning solo shot off reliever Buck Farmer. It was the 18th homer by a Rays’ catcher this year ― two shy of a club record. Finally, Mahtook capped the long ball fiesta when he homered off Jeff Ferrell later in the frame.\n\nDo you wanna know the terrifying truth…or do you wanna see us sock a few dingers? pic.twitter.com/xBT6V80g9S\n— Tampa Bay Rays (@RaysBaseball) September 10, 2015\n\n\n\n\nOdorizzi clearly did the devils work against Miggy and company by tossing six shutout innings, scattering six hits and fanning six along the way. And though he got himself into a man at third and one-out situation in the third inning ― after Anthony Gose converted a double into three bases ― and a first and second with none-out rally in the fifth, Odorizzi made a couple of big pitches to force a popper out of J.D. Martinez, and a swinging strikeout of Miguel Cabrera (respectively) to get out of both unscathed.\nFriday\n\nEditor's Note: Danny is that you?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nSeen in the stands down the right-field line on Friday.\n\nThe Rays returned home to start a three-game series against the worst team in the AL East, the Boston Red Sox. Chris Archer battled to a 5+ IP/5 H/3 ER/2 BB/8 K line on 108 pitches.\n\nArcher started the sixth with a two run lead, yet Tampa Bay ended the frame down by one. The righty allowed an infield single through the hole at short by Xander Bogaerts, before David Ortiz blooped a single into center, putting runners at the corners with none out. After 108 pitches, Rays skipper Kevin Cash pulled Archer in favor of LHP Enny Romero, who entered to face a pair of lefties.\n\nTravis Shaw welcomed Romero by lining a 2-2 cutter to right for an RBI double. Pablo Sandoval knotted the game at three by hitting an 0-2 single toward short, where Asdrubal Cabrera made a diving stop. Yet Cabrera couldn’t fire off an accurate throw to Richie Shaffer at first, resulting in a runners on the corners with one out situation. Brandon Gomes replaced Romero, and a pair of fly balls (including a Ryan Hanigan sac-fly) brought home Shaw with the lead run.\n\nJunichi Tazawa took the mound with a one run lead in the bottom of the eighth. Evan Longoria quickly fell behind Tazawa before taking a 2-2 pitch to right-center for a double. Needing to come up big, Forsythe plated the tying run on a single to right, then was promptly wild pitched to second. A simple tie wouldn’t do, and Cabrera belted a two-run homer (his 12th) to center for a two-run lead.\n\nThe Rays weren’t done! Steven Souza Jr. beat out an infield single to the swarthy Pablo Sandoval at third, then was wild pitched to second before stealing his way to third. Not to be left out, JP Arencibia leveled a monster shot to section 143 (cough, three feet to my left) in left field off Noe Ramirez, the third pitcher of the inning.\n\nYour browser does not support frames.\n\nIf you squint your eyes, you can see me fist pump in joy, just behind the guy who caught Arencibia's bomb. It was truly my Pauly D. moment. Tampa Bay ultimately walked away victorious, taking the first game of the series 8-4.\nSaturday\n\nAnother game, another career milestone at the hands of the Rays. Matt Moore got the start and laid a 5 IP/9 H/8 ER/1 BB/3 K/4 HR egg, which included David Ortiz’s 500th homer. Per Dave Haller (Tampa Bay Rays director of communications) it was Ortiz’s sixth career multi-HR game at Tropicana Field, tying Carlos Pena for most all-time. Kevin Cash said they wouldn’t read too much into Moore’s outing; his stuff was good but he poorly located his pitches. He is expected make his next start as scheduled. Still, one can’t help but wonder why Nathan Karns didn’t take over for Moore ― you know, since he was named as Moore’s caddy.\nSunday\n\nDrew Smyly made his second start in a week’s time amidst questions of which Drew might take the mound. After all, the lefty has alternated between good and bad starts since returning from the DL. Smyly silenced the critics by posting a dominant 6 IP/4 H/0 R/2 BB/11 K gem on 97 pitches (60 strikes). Sure, the southpaw got himself into five full counts. However, he also came back with big pitches in three of those situations, collecting a pair of swinging strikeouts and a ground ball out.\n\nYet, 35 year-old LHP Rich Hill proved to be an equally formidable opponent in his first start since 2009, holding Tampa Bay to just one hit in seven strong innings. Only three batters reached against Hill on a walk, a hit, and a hit by pitch of Richie Shaffer.\n\nBoth teams traded relievers back and fourth, yet neither relinquished a run, and into extras the ballgame went for the second time in a week. Adding insult to injury, only two other Rays reached (on a pair of 10th inning walks) until Steven Souza Jr. smoked a double up the left field line in the 11th. Still, they couldn’t push past the winning run.\n\nAfter Enny Romero dealt three consecutive hits to load the bases with one out, Kevin Cash called upon Andrew Bellatti, who promptly gave up a two-run liner into left, handing Boston the go ahead lead in the 13th. In the end the Rays fell in extra innings for 11th time this season. They ended the day four games under .500, tying their low water marks for the season.\n\nThey’ll welcome the Evil Empire into Tropicana Field for a three-game set, starting Monday. The Rays remain six games back in the Wild Card standings with five teams separating them from the post season.
0304_15204191-d961-4fef-897d-69f6473b76b6	High schoolers can now earn money for college -- no job required. \n \nStartup Raise.me developed a program that allows high school students to start banking college scholarship money. \n\nWhat's the catch? \n\nThe money is tied to students' individual achievements. The better they do in school, the more engaged they are with their communities, the more money they earn from Raise.me's college partners. \n\nThere are 26 colleges on Raise.me's platform, including Penn State, UMass and Tulane. Raise.me cofounder Preston Silverman hopes to increase that to 100 colleges by the end of the year. \n\nAs long as students meet the college's GPA requirements, they can start earning money from as many as they choose -- between $500 to $1,000 per achievement. Students don't get the money until they are accepted to one of the colleges. \n\nAbby Saxastar raised $80,000 on Raise.me, which will fully cover her tuition at Stetson University, a private college in central Florida. \n\n"I've always been very successful in school and I've also done a lot of volunteer work," said Saxastar. "But I still had to figure out how to pay for college." \n\nSaxastar learned about the program a few months before she graduated high school in June, but the program allows students to retroactively include information. So even as a senior, Saxastar could log her grades and activities for the past four years. \n\n"My family is digging through some debt and taking out loans for my other expenses," she said. "So getting this scholarship has been amazing." \n\nSaxastar is one of 60,000 students from 5,000 high schools who have signed up with Raise.me since it launched in August 2014. The startup has received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Facebook. \n\nColleges committed a total of $1 billion in scholarships in the first year, but Silverman said there isn't data on how much of this was actually paid out to students. The goal is to make scholarships available to students who may not otherwise pursue them. \n\n"Most scholarships today are awarded at the very end of high school. It's too late to influence a student's college search and application process," he said. \n\nSilverman said colleges are on board because it helps them reach students much earlier in the selection process. \n\nBeatriz Zayas is head counselor at the Southwest High School in El Centro, California, a city on the border with Mexico and Arizona. It's a predominantly rural area, and 90% of the 2,100 students are Hispanic. \n\n"A high percentage are from low-income families, but we're hoping they will become first-generation college students," said Zayas. \n\nRaise.me could become a critical part of that. There are 60 students at Southwest currently enrolled in the program. Zayas said they opted to focus on a small International Baccalaureate class first, in order to provide the necessary support. \n\n"It's putting good colleges on the radar of families who wouldn't have known about them otherwise," she said. \n\nAlthough Raise.me doesn't target a specific demographic, Silverman said 49% of students on the platform are from low-income families. \n\nA few colleges, including Florida International University, are even offering scholarships specifically to these students. \n\nThe university plans to partner with Raise.me this year to target low-income Florida high schools. \n\n"With many first-generation families, their socioeconomic barriers prevent them from taking advantage of a lot of things," said Luisa Havens, vice president of enrollment services with Florida International University. "Raise.me is perfect way to give them access to opportunity."

We've  put it behind us." \n\n\n\n \nMeanwhile, fellow contestant Kellie Bright named and shamed her EastEnders co-star Danny Dyer as being a closet fake tan user. \n\nThe 39-year-old actress, who plays Queen Vic landlady Linda Carter in the BBC show, revealed soap bosses had told her not to have a spray tan for the dance competition as it would interfere with filming continuity. \n\nBut she said Dyer, who plays her on-screen husband Mick Carter, secretly wears it anyway. \n\nBright said of having a professional spray tan: "The EastEnders producers told  me I couldn't, but Danny Dyer  puts fake tan on every day! \n\n\t\t\t \n"Sometimes he goes too far, so  I'll just match his mahogany head." \n\nFormer Strictly stars are set to discuss Life After Strictly at the Radio Times Festival this weekend. \n\nThe full interview with this year's Strictly contestants appears in this week's Radio Times, on sale now. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
0307_24b94261-aa09-4a40-a182-2667b542a00c	Nice of them to let us know they’re still as ludicrous and evil as ever Saturday, September 26, 2015 By Carlo Sands\nA radical environmentalist plots her next extremist act. If you are reading this, you are clearly at high risk of “radicalisation” — a budding violent extremist probably only a few Triple J Hottest 100 tracks away from blowing up Parliament House, or at least picketing the offices of a classic FM station. You probably picked up a copy of this radical extremist rag from a dodgy-looking bloke who emerged from an alley saying: “Psst … you want a copy of Green Left Weekly or some MP3s of some real alternative shit? I got some full on folk punk protest stuff on here, plus a few leaflets for the upcoming anti-shark culling protest if you are after the really heavy shit…” The government’s Preventing Violent Extremism and Radicalisation in Australia “awareness kit”, which it sent to schools, has been widely mocked — not least for the absurd “case study” of “Karen” who went from “alternative music” to environmental extremism. But this is just the most ridiculous part of a sinister publication. Its attempt to demonise environmental activism is worrying, but the main target is the Muslim community — where the demonisation is far less cartoonish and more a lived experience in fear and bigotry. To grasp how little this “awareness kit” has to do with combating violence or national security, consider the fact that it was never even meant to be sent to schools. Its main authors had no idea that would happen: one did not know until the Guardian told them. It was pulled together as a guide for “professionals in communities”. Professor Gary Bouma, who is quoted extensively throughout, has repudiated the final document. It was twisted to be a school “awareness kit” — and promptly leaked to the Murdoch press, which obliged with screaming headlines. It was a cheap political stunt that had as much to do with genuine concern for “national security” as Tony Abbott has in not destabilising Malcolm Turnbull. Even Karen’s now world-famous story was severely twisted. A study author said Karen was a “well-known case study” who was “an example of someone who in fact did not radicalise”. Yet, she is highlighted in the section on “violent extremism”. This sleight of hand, in which “radicalisation” and “violent extremism” are used interchangeably, occurs throughout. The “Living Safe Together” website, tied to the kit, includes defending controversial government policies, such as towards Syria, to combat “radical” ideas. This is ironic considering bombing another country might be considered to be a somewhat extreme and violent act, but presumably only by those yet to be re-educa … engaged in a respectful dialogue aimed at preventing extremist conclusions like war breeds terrorism. Also ironic is that Professor Pete Lentini, who worked on the project, said its authors had intended “radical” as a neutral, technical term, referring to “a change in belief structure”. “I actually think, thank god for radicals, things like the suffragette movement, anti-slavery, and so on,” he told the Guardian. “And I actually got interested in the study of politics through alternative music.” Especially disturbing is the brochure’s constant counter-posing of “radicalisation” with the “mainstream” — as though the very act of holding a different idea is a matter of grave suspicion. Should anyone you know actually give voice to such views that fall outside the existing consensus, well, the brochure kindly provides the Terrorism Hotline at the back. How do you actually achieve any progress if anyone with views differing from the currently accepted wisdom is to be treated like a defendant in a medieval witch trial? After all, witch trials, slavery and 1980s hairstyles were all once entirely “mainstream”. The answer, presumably, is that even posing such a question requires an organised intervention that involves being locked in a room with only old Andrew Bolt columns to read until you capitulate. The reasons for the government’s political stunt are pretty obvious. Dedicated to dismantling the social safety net, stripping back hard-won working conditions and determined to turn the whole nation into an open-cut coalmine, “national security” is one of the only issues on which the Coalition feels it can connect with voters. This makes it all the more stunning that, on the back of the Border Farce debacle a few weeks back, they managed to screw it up so severely once again. Still, I suppose it was good of the justice minister and minister assisting the PM on counter terrorism, Michael Keenan, to prove that despite all the recent shake-ups, Tony Abbott’s spirit of sinister incompetence lives on.

0308_ceb08029-2970-4e23-bfb3-27964368b42b	Tuesday: Well, the big day is finally here, and we have successfully got ourselves to the airport, albeit waaaay earlier than necessary, to ensure we made it through Customs before they went on strike!! None of us cope with stress that well, and after not much sleep, 4 shots of coffee, and an early cab, my body was already trembling!! Much better now - plugged in an connected in the departure lounge! It has been a busy week, as I finalised outfits, made fascinators for family, and even whipped up a cravat for Matt last night! My hands are sore from stitching and folding, cutting and holding, and are looking forward to a rest. Yesterday I had one more fascinator to make, having found out that my bestest Bunneh is arriving in Wellington on Friday to see the show and be there for the wedding! Best surprise EVER!! We arrived, a little later than planned, and were picked up and driven to our hotel - thank you Wellington City Council - you made my sister's day! I was due for a photoshoot at the Foxglove at 4, so sidled up to our driver José and asked if he could drop me off there after leaving the others at the hotel. The dear man agreed, and I quickly delved into my suitcase for my make-up bag and bouquet, and made it just in time. I was pretty stressed by then, but the lovely photographer Moniqué said not to stress, fix my face, and of course I had time for a drink! Which I attempted to pay for with Australian money. Shoot done, it was time to meet the staff of the Foxglove in preparation for Saturday, and all looks to be under control. Next stop - noms! And wine. Then back to our lovely abode. Pettigrew. Callum Pettigrew. Wednesday: After the usual holiday 'gumboot water' we set off into town, ending up at The Lido for brekky and some rather good coffee, served by a lovely man. There's a certain breed of menfolk in New Zealand - they're kind of old-school, well mannered but good fun, and snappy dressers. Such as our next encounter at the suit hire shop, where our very helpful man ended up doing Yoda impersonations! I just love it when people 'play' with us - it just makes it fun for everyone! So many people seem to be so miserable in their jobs and their interactions within them - yet it's so easy to make it fun!\nFrom here we walked up Cuba Street, where Liam arrived in Paradise, aka Comrades Army Disposals, whose sign reads "Everything you want but don't need". Nailed it. Further wandering took us down near Coles, so we decided to get our shop done. Good Lord, the price of asparagus and tomatoes!!! But ahhh, the joy of buying the beer and wine at the supermarket.  Next it was back to the Foxglove to sort out the final details, then a little shopping. I exhausted myself running all over town looking for a protective iron cover as I have a lot of special silk garments to iron, and forgot to pack mine. I also needed a new sleeper as Liam noticed  my nose-ring had disappeared - whaaat?! I've had that in for so many years, and that has never happened before! Success with the sleeper, none with the iron cover....Then it was time to meet with our celebrant, where more detai Matt at the Foxglove ls were sorted, and it all started to feel very real! I must have been a bit tired and emotional, as I looked down at the paperwork and saw my father's name, and instantly teared up as it would have been so lovely if he could have been here.  He should have been here.\nAcrylic chain mail goodness Beloved Boi then went down to pick up the tickets for the show, leaving Callum and I to start getting ready for Preview. By now, I started to realise what a ridiculously busy week this was! Before we knew it, there we were, reuniting with designers and getting excited!  As usual, we pored over the catalogue afterwards, and I stayed up too late doing so with some vodka.... ICK!!! Thursday: .....leaving me slightly dusty for Designer Day! More reunions at Rydges before boarding the bus to the Roxy, where we enjoyed Sir Richard Taylor's introduction, and a presentation by WETA technician Gino. The next few hours were quite relaxed, as we enjoyed demonstrations of the application of body paint and prosthetics, as well as a display of WETA armour and chainmail made by Eve Gilliland. There was also a display of amazing ly realistic body parts, which felt absolutely ooky!! After lunch, it was off to the latest WETA attraction, a bit of a behind the scenes look at the makings of the prosthetics and the armour. No photos, no touching - we exercised an incredible amount of restraint!! Back to the Roxy for a Creative Industries Panel, which was very enjoyable, although many of us had drooping eyes by now! And so ends this post, as I relax in the warm burrow with some bubbles and a pile of ironing....

The above video reveals an irate Brooklynite screaming at another man, and includes the remarkable line, “The only reason white people like you are living here is because I settled this fucking neighborhood for you!” \n\nWe really have to wonder what was going through the head of the black security guard separating the unknown Angry White Man from the white couple with a stroller, especially when the Angry White Man said the following: “White privilege! White fucking privilege! You pushed your stroller right into me, and all I say was, ‘Excuse you,’ and then you said, ‘Fuck you, fuck you!’ You fucking white trash!” This wasn’t an exaggeration.

If two pairs of husband and wife each of them has one boy and one girl , and then the child is married and has one child then if in 2015 there were 1 million births in year 2035, it is difficult to get 2 million adults.

The hilarious actress, who was granted US citizenship in a cute ceremony in early August, stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday and attempted to take the host's own version of a citizenship test . Jimmy asked Emily a series of hard-hitting and important questions, including, "what does DQ stand for?" and "what are the giant refillable sodas at 7-Eleven called?" Emily also offered up a hilarious story about her husband, John Krasinski , during her swearing-in ceremony. Watch the video above to see how well Emily knows her facts, and then check out the cutest pictures of her and John .

It was awesome to just be able to relax with your home clothes, chatting with your best friends, watching movies with Aaron while Harris n Kelly baked cookies n cooked dinner in the kitchen,,,, yea awesome. Painfully awesome;)\nAnd do you know what's extra special?  Is that one flew all the way over to KL to minute he found out what happened to me while the other one took leave off work to be with me. For 2 days in a row! Comfort at it's best. Especially since my husband had an important pre-assigned shoot in East Malaysia that couldn't be cancelled and I am one person who never like being alone when I'm unwell. Now do you know why I always boast about having the most incredible best friends in the world?\nLooks awful doesn't it? I cringe every time I look at it to be honest. I'm feeling much better now anyway.

0318_89b3dd2c-849f-479c-a991-4b56f964acb3	Everyone has people in their lives that deeply altered or impacted their journey in this thing we call life. Preston was one of those for me. He balanced me. Mr. Kenny Puryear was another. He taught me about what it meant to follow Jesus. Then there was Mr. Chuck Walden. He humbled me. He showed me what it meant to have a deeper relationship with Christ. He challenged me and made me uncomfortable. But let me start from the beginning:\n\nPres and I married in 2009 and moved to Dyersburg, TN. We were church hopping and finally settled in at West Dyersburg. We were fresh out of college and thought we knew everything. We quickly realized we didn't. We were attending W.D. but would sit on back row and skip out immediately after service before anyone could talk to us. Neither of us were very happy or in a great place with God. We did this for about a year. Two major things happened: \n\n1. We hired 2 new pastors: Ricky Burse & Chris Fry\n\n2. Lane Wellington decided we were going to be friends. \n\nI could talk about Ricky Burse and how amazing he is for the rest of this post. If he ever decided to move to middle TN I would hire him immediately as my assistant. He was unlike any minister I had ever been around. He had so much passion. It was contagious. \n\nChris is awesome as well but with Chris came his wife, Vicki. She has such a calming, peaceful soul that you crave to be around her. She is such a nurturer. She carried me the first year after I had pax. Being a new mom is tough and without a support group it's even harder. She coached me up!\n\nLane adopted Pres and me. She literally told me "you may not like it but we are going to be friends." And we were and always will be. Since she adopted us, it brought us into a group of older couples who mentored Pres and I in more ways than they could ever imagine. One of those couples was the Waldens. \n\nMr. Chuck and Ms. Bobbi were such an amazing couple. True servants. Mr. Chuck was intentional. Every conversation had a purpose. It was to just shoot the breeze but had a deeper meaning. He always asked how are you and God? How's the communication? He wanted to know that when he got to Heaven you would be there too. He challenged you in why you thought the way you did. Wanted to know why you believed that and left it up to you to come up with the answer. A man of few words but so much punch in them. \n\nI can't say why he became interested with Pres and I but he did. He would attend my middle school basketball games to see me in action but also to visit with Preston. Preston and chuck spent hours on th golf course. They would have deep spiritual conversations that usually led Pres to realize how much he needed to study and learn to develop his own faith instead of what he grew up knowing. \n\nBaptism was the main topic Mr. Chuck and I talked about. At that time, I was 23 and was really absorbing everything I could about Christianity. I had just come out of Lipscomb and had new ideas and beliefs that I wanted to learn more about. Baptism is one of them. I grew up Presbyterian and being sprinkled is the form of baptism. Mr. Kenny and I had started talking about this topic but didn't finish since pres and I moved. Mr. Chuck picked right up where we had left off. For about 3 months we talked and studied and I had come to conclusion baptism=submersion. I also got baptized so young that I hadn't truly found Jesus or knew what it meant to follow Jesus. I had a better understanding at 23. I was 7 months pregnant and Mr. Chuck came and at by me one night after Sunday evening service.  He said Catie we have been talking about baptism for several months now but here you sit. (Told you he was something else...blunt and to the point) I looked at him in those crystal blue eyes and said your right.  I found Ricky and told him what I wanted/needed. In front of my closest West Dyersburg family, I was baptized. Mr. Chuck was a proud poppa like I know he has been for so many people. That's another unique quality he had...he made you feel like you were the most important thing he has going. And to him, seeing me in heaven with him was the most important. \n\nA few months later Mr. Chuck was diagnosed with cancer. For the last four years he and his family have been battling this awful, crippling disease. Most would should and say why me? Not Mr. Chuck. He said if through this disease someone would find Christ than the disease served its purpose. His hope was built on nothing less but Jesus blood and righteousness. He blogged during the entire 4 years he sought treatment and a cure. It's amazing. Simply amazing. \n\nI want to understand why God takes someone like him who was such an obedient servant. My course in life was greatly altered from being in Dyersburg. My faith flourished all because of those few people taking the time to make a difference in a young couple who were struggling to find a place. \n\nGod is good. God loves you. -Chuck

Production growth, new processing infrastructure and increased use of rail are shifting traditional flow patterns in the propane industry. New production and processing is adjacent to historic centers of consumer demand in the Northeast and Mid-Continent – reducing seasonal risks of shortage. Rail distribution improves delivery flexibility. The supply chain has to be flexible enough to balance seasonal consumer demand with increased chemical processing and high export volumes. Today we describe improved regional interconnectivity. This blog and others in the series are based on an analysis recently completed by RBN for the Propane Education and Research Council (PERC). PERC engaged RBN to assess market developments that could impact the prospects of disruptions similar to the one that occurred in the Perfect Storm winter of 2013-14, and to suggest actions that could alleviate the risk of such market turmoil. The project was completed in August and with the permission of PERC, this blog series summarizes some of RBN’s analysis and conclusions. This is the sixth episode in the series. Episode 1 provided an overview and introduction to the analysis – beginning with the dramatic increase in propane production over the past 7 years. Total U.S. propane output has increased by nearly 70% from an average of 0.8 MMb/d in 2008 to 1.4 MMb/d during the 1st half of 2015. Most of that growth has been driven by production from gas processing plants that has more than doubled from 0.5 MMb/d in 2008 to 1.1 MMb/d in 2015. The overall growth in propane has outpaced domestic demand such that as much as 50% of the total is now exported to balance the market – even as inventories are at all time high levels. RBN’s analysis for PERC sought to understand changes to the propane market since the disruptive winter of 2013-14 as well as how susceptible today’s market is to similar events and what actions should be taken to reduce the risk of it happening again. Our approach to the analysis involved developing a monthly model of U.S. propane supply, demand, logistics and pricing at the PADD (Petroleum Administration District for Defense) level using historic propane market data. In Episode 2 we outlined supply and demand scenarios for the model based on oil price Growth and Contraction as well as Normal and Severe weather patterns. Episode 3 took a closer look at propane production by PADD region – noting the dramatic growth in the Northeast as well as the Midwest. Episode 4 detailed regional historic and future projected propane demand by PADD and Episode 5 looked at the main domestic propane demand sectors and the projected influence of weather on future consumption. This time we highlight how new infrastructure has improved interregional connectivity across the propane market.
0320_6f982951-6291-4d0e-891d-f88342173570	(CNN) \n\nCongressional Republicans hope Pope Francis leaves his liberal-leaning views at the Vatican. \n\nWhen he addresses a joint session of Congress Thursday during an event that will be broadcast around the world, a large number of House and Senate Republicans want the leader of the Catholic Church to keep a lid on his progressive attitudes on climate change, immigration, guns and capitalism. \n\nIn interviews with CNN, a wide array of GOP lawmakers argued that the Pope's message should stay away from the political fights consuming Washington, and many expressed strong disapproval of the fiery views he's espoused since taking over the papacy in 2013. \n \n"I think it's totally inappropriate that the Pope is weighing in on all the real sensitive, far-left issues," said Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe, one of the most conservative senators. "I'm not a Catholic, but my Catholic friends in Oklahoma are not real pleased with it." \n\nRep. Paul Gosar, a Catholic Republican from Arizona, plans to boycott the event. \n\n"I don't need to be lectured by the Pope about climate change," Gosar said in an interview off the House floor. "When he wants to take a political position, I will tell you: He is free and clear to be criticized like the rest of us." \n\nThe comments demonstrate how the Pope's visit is creating an awkward moment for Republicans in Washington. While Christian conservatives have long made up an influential segment of their base, and there are areas of agreement between the GOP and the Vatican, the Pope has showcased more progressive stances during his time leading one of the world's largest religions. \n\nWhen he comes to the Capitol this week, his highly anticipated address will be viewed by millions of Americans, and thousands of tourists are pouring into Washington for a chance to catch a glimpse of the pontiff. House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, both Catholics, extended the speaking invitation to Francis, who will become the first pontiff ever to address a joint session of Congress. \n\nThe huge platform gives Pope Francis a major opportunity to help drive the national conversation. What's more, nearly six in 10 Americans have a favorable view of Francis, according to a recent Gallup poll, making him far more popular than President Barack Obama and leaders of Congress. \n\nHow aggressive Francis will be in advocating his views to a conservative Congress is an open question. But he has not been afraid to touch on thorny subjects over the last several years, drawing global attention for his stances. \n\nIn a highly controversial paper released by the Vatican this summer, Francis backed the "very consistent scientific consensus" that climate change is caused by humans, saying it was "urgent" to develop policies to bolster the environment and curtail fossil fuels. \n\nIn comments in July, Francis focused on the plight of migrant children, saying governments must move to "protect and assist them," in line with his repeated statements for a compassionate approach to immigration. \n\nHe has also spoken more tolerantly about gays than previous pontiffs, saying famously, "Who am I to judge?" -- a sharp contrast with his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI's hardline on homosexuality. \n\nFrancis has blasted gun manufacturers, likening them to hypocrites. And in a series of tough speeches, Francis has railed against global capitalism, even calling it a "subtle dictatorship." \n\nSuch comments make many Republicans cringe. \n\n"I'm always concerned about those who are bringing spiritual messages that step too far over the line in terms of political issues," said Sen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican and Presbyterian. "I think it can be dangerous territory because then it gives people reason to make a judgment on say, Billy Graham or the Pope or whoever, on the basis of their political leanings -- not on the basis of their spirituality." \n\nAnd Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, a Catholic, didn't hold back Sunday from criticizing Pope Francis on his stance on a political issue -- his advocacy of closer ties between the United States and Cuba. \n\n"I just think the Pope is wrong," the New Jersey governor told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." "The fact is that his infallibility is on religious matters, not on political ones." \n\nStill, the Pope also espouses social views that are in line with the GOP, chief among them opposition to abortion. \n\nWith his huge perch this week, some Republicans hope that Francis will reiterate the church's objections to the procedure -- an issue that is now paralyzing progress on a funding bill on Capitol Hill -- though that could spark protests from congressional Democrats. \n\n"I think he will solidly be on the side of those of us who want to restrict tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood," said John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. \n\n"I have no thought that the Pope is going to be weak on the issue of protecting the unborn," said Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican. \n\nSome Catholic Republicans said they plan to soak in the historic visit, praising the Pope for injecting new energy into the church and pushing for a new era of inclusiveness -- even if they sharply disagree with some of his views. \n\n"I would trust him to do his best to say what's on his mind," said Sen. Mike Rounds, a former GOP South Dakota governor and a Roman Catholic. "We'll thank him for what he brings to the table and at the same time, we'll glean from him what we think will be helpful." \n\nBut Rounds pointedly disagreed with the Pope's views on capitalism. \n\n"Personally, I think if you think of the quality of life that has been delivered to millions of people around the world and freedoms that we find for people around the world, most of it has happened because of innovation due to capitalism, and because the United States of America exists," Rounds said. \n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Catholic Republican from North Carolina, said the Pope is well within his rights to lay out his goals and views. \n\n"The Pope is the leader of my church," Tillis said. "He is doing what popes have done for hundreds of years -- that does not bother me." \n\nBut, Tillis said, the final call on how to achieve those objectives is up to lawmakers -- not the church. \n\nOther Catholic Republicans, however, were more reticent when asked about the Pope's views. \n\n"I'm going to do the right thing and not comment on this," said Idaho Sen. Jim Risch. "I'm a conservative Catholic, and I have been all my life." \n\nIn recent years, the House chamber has hosted its share of high-profile, tense speeches. Earlier this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress to protest the nuclear talks with Iran, prompting sharp condemnation from the White House and liberal Democrats. In 2009, South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson yelled "You lie!" during Obama's speech to Congress about health care. And every year, the President delivers a mostly partisan State of the Union address to the rowdy body. \n\nYet Francis's speech is expected to be far more prominent than all of those, with Boehner calling it "one of the biggest events in the history of the Capitol." \n\nIn anticipation of the much-publicized address, Boehner and other congressional leaders sent an unusual letter last week to lawmakers asking them to assist with the flow of the event by "refraining" from "lengthy" handshakes with the Pope and to avoid holding side conversations with him in order to let him progress with his schedule. \n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership, said he hopes the Pope "casts a fairly wide net, talking about things like religious freedom and the issues that affect families." \n\nBut Blunt added, "I don't think we have much control over what he says." \n\nInhofe, however, thinks the Pope should restrain himself. On the issue of enacting policies to curb global warming, Inhofe, a climate skeptic who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said: "That's not something that I think the Pope ought to be talking about." \n\nHe added, "I have never experienced a time when a Pope would jump on (so many) very extreme issues."
0321_9f48a10d-5ea8-40c5-a946-e2785b5677e9	) - San Francisco Bay Area graphic design firm, Project6 Design, has been awarded two 2015 WebAwards. Standard of excellence awards were received for both the Rosendin Electric and Trihydro Corporation websites.\n\nThe Web Marketing Association was founded in 1997 to help set a high standard for Internet marketing and development of the best websites on the World Wide Web. The Web Marketing Association is the producer of the WebAward Competition. Now in its 17th year, the WebAward program is the longest running annual website award competition dedicated to naming the best websites in 96 industries while setting the standard of excellence for all website development.\n\nNearing their centennial anniversary, Rosendin Electric has grown from a Santa Clara-based motor winding company that serviced their immediate agricultural community into one of the nation's largest private electrical contractors. Rosendin Electric's former site was nearly a decade old and failed to communicate their position as industry leaders implementing cutting-edge technology. Site administrators lacked the tools to highlight news or engage visitors with portfolio highlights of their more popular projects. The site offered little support or information for Rosendin's many subcontractors, leaving both industry partners and employees to struggle with an ineffective workflow. \n\nTheir new website features a new portfolio section that highlights both current projects and their international reach while an extensive "About" section maintains a strong sense of their proud history and company culture. The site's architecture was overhauled to drive user engagement with streamlined navigation. To meet the client's needs for greener and more efficient operations, Project6 implemented an innovative subcontractor portal that provides a simple, centralized location for communication with industry partners. For a more efficient administrative experience, Project6 migrated Rosendin Electric to a Drupal content management system (CMS). The new Rosendin Electric website speaks to both the partners and communities they serve while supporting the brand's position as leaders in their industry.\n\nTrihydro Corporation is a leading provider of environmental engineering services. Based in Laramie, Wyoming, this organization has grown to tackle challenges on a worldwide scale, but their previous site didn't convey their position as innovative leaders in environmental engineering. Project6 embraced the challenge by selecting the Sitefinity CMS for its ability to leverage a robust amount of content and media across a responsive website. In restructuring the site architecture, the website now promotes equal attention to each of Trihydro's services and markets and giving any prospective clients a streamlined path to identify the sectors that interest them most. By using a new modern design, captivating images of real Trihydro employees in the field and intuitive navigation, the result is a unique user experience. Combined with custom imagery and a modern, open feel, the new Trihydro site reflects their position as a global firm without losing the sense of their commitment to clients or their company culture. \n\n"Project6 simplified the enormous task of redesigning our website and marketing materials with creativity, responsiveness, and detailed project coordination. They turned a complex process into a well-oiled machine that gave us exactly what we were looking for: eye-grabbing design that embraces our brand, displays innovation, and serves as an effective tool for our business." ~Becca Marcott, Trihydro Corporation\n\nProject6 Design is an award-winning San Francisco Bay Area graphic design firm working with high-tech, retail, education, and nonprofit organizations.

0322_2073337d-b0b0-410e-b141-e0c869ab3102	(#401: 11 November 1989, 3 weeks) Track listing: The Road To Hell (Part I)/The Road To Hell (Part II)/You Must Be Evil/Texas/Looking For A Rainbow/Your Warm And Tender Love/Daytona/That’s What They Always Say/I Just Wanna Be With You/Tell Me There’s A Heaven PROLOGUE I On 26 May 1989, Don Revie died in Murrayfield Hospital, Edinburgh. He was sixty-one years old and had for some time been suffering from motor neurone disease. After leaving Leeds United to manage the England team fifteen years previously, he never recaptured his former success, either with England or the UAE and other Arabic teams which he later managed. Gigantic question marks, mainly centred on financial matters and fair play, ensured that he became a figure conveniently forgotten about by the football establishment, left in the corner, out of sight, purposely neglected. PROLOGUE II In 1989, Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest finished third in the League and won both the League Cup and the Full Members Cup. They also reached the semi-final of that year’s FA Cup. Their opponents were Liverpool. But they lost to Liverpool in the replay. A replay was necessary because the original match had to be abandoned after six minutes of play. The original FA Cup semi-final, which was to be played at the Hillsborough stadium. “She says that mess it don’t get no better There’s gonna come a day Someone gonna get killed out there” ENVOI I Clough and Revie grew up about a mile apart from each other in Middlesbrough; Clough in Valley Road, Revie in Bell Street. In between used to be the old Middlesbrough ground, Ayresome Park, and there still exists Albert Park. As managers, Clough and Revie had little time for each other, as became painfully apparent when Clough surprisingly but only briefly replaced Revie as manager of Leeds United. Revie was keen and quick to get away, in the first instance to Leicester City as a player, but Clough never neglected his roots. What is certain is that both Clough and Revie would have frequently spent time in the now-defunct establishment which was just across the road from Valley Park; indeed it was where Clough met his wife Barbara, and where he would frequently retreat for discussions with his sidekick Peter Taylor. This establishment was Rea’s Ice Cream parlour. “A promise to get out That’s what it’s all about” BACKGROUND I Camillo Rea ‘s father was from New York but somehow ended up in Middlesbrough. He started an ice cream business – essentially a factory and a cafe, later to be followed by numerous other cafes through north-east England – but was killed in 1946 when a ship taking him to Canada was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean. Camillo and his brother Gaetano took over and expanded the family business. Camillo had seven children, all of whom were expected to follow him into the business. The young Chris recalls having to work in his father’s coffee bar, serving behind the counter and washing the dishes. Gradually becoming disillusioned with this way of living, Chris eventually opted to pursue a career in music. A rift developed between him and his father, and although Camillo Rea lived on until almost the end of 2010, there appears never to have been a reconciliation. “Tell me that they’re happy now Papa tell me that it’s so” THE CLASH It was their last single. It came out in late September 1985, the same week as “Slave To The Rhythm,” “Alive And Kicking” and others. It was the only single from the Clash album that radio and Sony would much rather have you forget or not know that it ever existed. I haven’t spoken much here about The Clash because they never had a number one album, although both Give ‘Em Enough Rope and Combat Rock – their most “American” records – came very close, and maybe also because they didn’t quite avoid becoming the critically acclaimed albums act that they, or at least most of them, had not wanted to become in the first place. At least, not when Mick Jones was there. But by 1985 Jones was two years gone, and there were just Strummer, Simonon, Rhodes and three new recruits, trying to work their way back to why they had ever wanted to do this, as if they had known more about what The Clash should have meant than the man who had originally formed the group and recruited them. You hardly ever hear, or hear about, “This Is England,” but it is The Clash and Joe Strummer’s greatest and most forsaken moment. Always best when lost, alone and confused – “Complete Control” starts out as a diatribe against their record company but ends up questioning art and motive, “White Man In Hammersmith Palais” demonstrates how someone can live and grow up somewhere and not realise until too late that they know nothing about their own home, “Death Is A Star” being the romantic response to “Decades” – the song begins with a midtempo dub rhythm, slowly joined by a loop of children’s voices and a cloud of synthesiser. And then Strummer angrily barges in with his voice, as exhausted as Lennon’s at the end of “Twist And Shout,” and grim guitar, and sings about what might be a riot, or an extermination process  (“Are they howling out or doing somebody harm?”), during which a woman grabs him coldly by the arm and declares “THIS IS ENGLAND.” The chorus follows, with the title echoed by a huge football crowd. This is the 1985 England of Bradford, Broadwater Farm and Heysel. Strummer then muses about the wretched lot of the Falklands soldier, or just the ordinary worker (“He won’t go for the carrot/They beat him by the pole”). The steady decline continues. “I got my motorcycle jacket but I’m walking all the time” “I’m going to Texas I’m going to Texas Watch me walking Watch me walking” both anticipates and outdoes “Motorcycle Emptiness”; the aimless and pointlessness of “rebellion” with punk having resulted in little more than the Falklands (“Ice from  a dying creed”). Then the mood gets violent again; there are race riots – they have ended up where they started, but is all that people thought a “White Riot” meant? – and then the British beat themselves over the head with their own batons, shrug their shoulders and say well that’s the way it is, THIS IS ENGLAND, the “land of illegal dances” half a decade ahead of rave (perhaps just another, more placid baton). “The newspapers being read/Who dares to protest?” Strummer asks rhetorically. Then everything falls, dies away except that blunt guitar, grinding out its punk riff – DO ANY OF YOU DOUGHNUTS REMEMBER WHAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN ONCE? – seemingly forever, alone on the planet. The music discreetly fades until the guitar exhausts itself, stops and gives a feedback weep, for its country and this fruitless culture. HELL Cut The Crap is a mess, but the exhilarating mess punk had once promised to be; the opening “Dictator” with its arsenal of beatboxes and Video City samples, suggests the band Big Audio Dynamite might have been (the words here which ring out of the page are: “You know once there was freedom/You know how dangerous that can be”) and it is no surprise that in the following year both approaches fused and BAD put out the sometimes fantastic No 10 Upping Street – essentially a Clash-in-exile album (“Sightsee MC” still sounds like the last song you’d ever hear in London). This record, however – it’s only the penultimate number one of the eighties, but we can close down the decade with it – begins with a different use of found sounds; there is an ominous drone in the middleground. In the distance we hear a ghostly piano, picking out a nursery song the five-year-old piano student at home, at his piano, with his Ministeps To Music tutorial books, and a black-and-white television on the other side of the same room, the blue light, the theme songs, the fear while closer up there are scattered voices from radio scans, coming from all across the world, as though this were the fatal and total pile-up and all that was left of the world, a vague reminder of what humanity once aspired to. But there also enter deep Cooder curves of Middlesbrough delta guitar and that drone won’t go away. It is the M25 motorway which orbits, but does not enter, London at a twenty-five-mile radius. Travelling into the city by train from any direction, its appearance is a welcome signifier, indicating that the traveller is almost home. But the thing is that Britain will never learn, has always been parsimonious about so many things that it becomes destructive. In fifties America they had giant refrigerators, comic books and rock ‘n’ roll; in Britain we continued to allow ourselves to be punished with ration books and Hoggart lectures. It is as if Britain, which is fatally an island, has always felt unworthy of itself, thinks that it does not deserve what it receives, and yet fiercely protects the interests of those who have received far, far more than they deserve. Britain was never America. America has long, unbroken highways; motorways here are higgledy-piggledy things, forever winding around and narrowing themselves to protect the interests of landowners whose privileges date back to the time of agrarian enclosures. Britain is in the north of Europe and is therefore cold and damp most of the time. Most importantly, Britain cannot, or will not, plan ahead. The reason why getting around London by road is such an arduous task is because road-widening was rejected by vested interests in the nineteenth century who preferred roads which had been built to accommodate horse-drawn Victorian carriages. And I do not suppose that anybody involved in planning the M25, which by 1989 had been in operation for around three years – indeed was opened by the Prime Minister herself – had the remotest notion that its highways would rapidly be filled up by motorists keen on avoiding London. All motorists who probably also harboured the dream of getting away, of cruising down long, unbroken highways, but invariably think it’s always the other motorists’ fault. But the narrator here has not quite broken down; instead, he is sitting still, in gridlock. He sees a woman in the distance. She slowly comes up to his car, and when she bends down to speak to the driver, “A fearful pressure paralysed me in my shadow.” She asks “Son, what are you doing here?” He explains – calling her “Mama” with the implication that she is a ghost (“My fear for you has turned me in my grave”) – that he has “come to the valley of the rich” to sell himself. But she sadly tells him that in fact he is on the road to Hell. If the woman grabbing Strummer by the arm in “This Is England” is Thatcher – how could she not be? – then this woman’s identity is more ambiguous. It could theoretically be a gloating Thatcher, but I note that Rea’s actual mother, Winifred, died in 1983. But the way in which he announces the song and album’s name makes it feel like the last song anybody would hear. Martin Ditcham’s drums kick in, and the song starts up proper. The trick becomes evident to those who would listen – and Rea makes a point of making sure that the listener doesn’t miss hearing what he has to say – namely that, although this music superficially sounds like Dire Straits/yuppie-pleasing hi-fi/car-friendly AoR, he is using the uniform of the enemy to turn them back on themselves. “I’m underneath the streetlights But the light of joy I know Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows” “And at night, there came another dimension...of terror. As I prowled, I knew how scared I was, dead scared, yet not too scared to prowl.” (Ian S Munro) “And the perverted fear of violence Chokes a smile on every face” We’re really not too far away here from “This Is England,” are we? Nor indeed from Heaven 17, with the useless credit jamming up the roads. “Look out world, take a good look What comes down here You must learn this lesson fast And learn it well” If the second part of “The Road To Hell” predicates anything, it’s Leonard Cohen’s “The Future” from three years later. Possibly the most depressing thing about the latter song is how painfully accurate all his predictions have turned out to be – “Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima” indeed. I don’t know whether Cohen ever heard “The Road To Hell” but I do know that before going solo, Chris Rea played in a band called The Beautiful Losers. “This ain’t no upwardly mobile freeway OH NO, THIS IS THE ROAD TO HELL.” Upon which guitars, played by both Rea and Robert Ahwai, scream out jagged, torrid lines which have much more to do with Neil Young than with Knopfler. Always on this album the guitars sound as though in insurmountable pain. BACKGROUND II Chris Rea did not actually buy a guitar until he was in his early twenties; a late time to start. He taught himself to play it. Although influenced by his parents’ opera and light classical records, as a musician his main influences came from the blues, notably Sonny Boy Williamso, Charley Patton and Blind Willie Johnson; contemporary guitarists he admired included Ry Cooder and Joe Walsh. Although The Beautiful Losers were voted Best Newcomers in the Melody Maker poll of 1975, he had already been signed as a solo artist to Magnet Records the year before by the label’s head of A&R, Pete Waterman, but had to wait until 1978 before “Fool (If You Think It’s Over)” became a Billboard Top 20 hit. In Britain it missed the charts entirely on its first release and only scraped into the Top 30 upon reissue; it wasn’t until Elkie Brooks’ 1982 hit cover of the same song that the UK really began to pay attention to Rea’s music. He spent much of the eighties steadily building up his profile, particularly on the Continent, where he was a huge star long before his UK breakthrough. Given, however, that whenever he hit big he felt obliged to conform to what other people expected of him, it is no surprise that, following serious illness in the early 2000s, Rea resolved to revert to the kind of music he wanted to make, since when he has re-established himself as a highly respected blues performer who continues to record and tour with great success. He comes home from work, and his young daughter is crying over something they’ve shown on the news. He is outraged – “This ain’t even dinner time!,” “What’s wrong with you?,” “You don’t have to show that stuff/Can’t you show us some RESPECT?,” and threatening “I wish you were here”s. He concludes, chillingly, “You must be evil” – a warped and twisted media ready to make children cry and a nation collapse (“You giving out some bad ideas here”). “Looking For A Rainbow” grinds on for an agonising eight minutes and twenty seconds; he and his family have come down to the valley (of the shadow of death?) to seek their fortune – or so it would seem, because as the song progresses their real mission becomes clearer, “Maggie’s little children.../looking for Maggie’s farm” are actually here to exact their revenge... “You can’t leave us dying this time ‘Cos we’re all around your door” Between 2008-10 it was erroneously stated in some newspapers that Chris Rea had donated large sums of money to the Conservative Party and that he had been a long-time Conservative supporter. What the newspapers had done was to confuse him with another Chris Rea, a Sheffield businessman who is Group Managing Director of mechanical seal manufacturers AESSEAL and who had indeed donated money to the Conservatives. Although I note the strong work ethic that comes from growing up in an Italian family – and I should know – I am also aware that no one could have made a record like The Road To Hell and be a Conservative. Instead, in the album sleeve, Rea acknowledges “Everyone in all the governments.” Given that he values personal freedom and driving in particular, however, it is perhaps best to view the record as the rueful reflections of a disappointed small-c conservative, much in the vein of disappointed literary socialists such as Orwell, Huxley and Koestler. In “Your Warm And Tender Love,” he succeeds in finding refuge from the growing storm in love, the light which pierces all darkness. By the time of “I Just Wanna Be With You,” however, his need is turning into an obsession. “I just wanna be with you,” he reiterates, over and over, “’til the final curtain falls” and as an alternative to “know[ing] nothing at all.” “I know there’s a price to pay for doing what we do,” he cryptically admits, but that is no deterrence to their doing it. “That’s What They Always Say” is a sardonic rejoinder to those who talk all the time about getting away, making the break from the rat race, but who in their hearts know they’ll stay right where they are, gambling on that golden bridge just around the corner, “always one more thing to do.” But finally there is the realisation that there is no escape from this voluntary self-imprisonment. “The money junkie fades away,” remarks Rea, perhaps aware that he too will opt to hang on. But there are those dreams, the dreams of “Texas.” As the skies of Britain collapse around him and his wife (“Been watching some TV...It’s all gone crazy”) he fantasises about a place that priorities quarterbacks over quarterlights – “Warm winds blowing/Heating blue sky/And a road that goes forever.” Yet he concludes: “Watch me walking.” If he gets there, however, he’ll drive in his “Daytona,” a tribute to the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona classic car, which ceased production in 1973 but of which he still dreams exquisitely (“Twelve wild horses in silver chains/Calling out to me”). As with the “sweet angel” in “I Just Wanna Be With You,” he implores the Daytona to “shine your light on me.” Because nothing could be darker than this. It is almost the end of the record, this story of the mad dreams of the man stuck in his car who, for the second time, comes home to find his daughter – by 1989 Rea had two young daughters; nowhere are you really made to forget that this record is the work of a parent – watching television. And now, it is about abuse, and it is about violence and death – and beyond outrage, the narrator is at a loss what to say. “Grandpa says they’re happy now” – this is a song which involves three generations. He knows what grandpa is saying, and why he’s saying it, but he can’t find it in himself to believe it- Max Middleton’s string section freezes on the word “ice.” She is asking him, his little girl, to tell her that there’s a heaven, that these people will go somewhere, because otherwise why is she seeing all of this? He freezes and the strings descend into mild discordance before again settling. He turns to us for an answer: “So do I tell her that it’s true? That there’s a place for me and you?” But you can tell – “every painful crack of bones” – that he can’t tell her this story. The key line is: “What makes those men do what they do?” ...and you could say that this tale, this Then Play Long story, has been heading towards this conclusion all along, that the fundamental problem is not simply a question of why men do what they do, but the question of what constitutes evil. Because the closing vocal section of this song is truly terrifying, as the timpani rolls and the camera pulls back – “And I’m looking at the father and the son” as though the end credits are rolling, “And I’m looking at the mother and the daughter” – and then the strings become atonal again, with a thudding timpani heartbeat, as he sings “And I’m watching them in tears of pain/And I’m watching them suffer/DON’T TELL THAT LITTLE GIRL/TELL ME.” And then he sings the chorus again, but this time he’s the one asking, desperate to be convinced that it’s true, that some redemption must exist somewhere. The orchestra plays out as though this were a Lloyd Webber musical, and after some “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” oboe flourishes, the song, and the record, and its decade, are all laid to rest. There is nothing left save the silence. The question is not just how a record like this ever got to number one, but what it means in greater terms. We closed down the sixties with “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” saw out the seventies with “I Was Only Joking,” and now we are nearly done with the eighties, by way of its epitaph. But with “Tell Me There’s A Heaven” in particular – one of this tale’s key songs – there is the sense of a greater and more horrific truth being revealed, and revelation is perhaps the last thing that needed to be done, since it all seems to have happened, as the book title goes, in plain sight. Here we are at the end of a decade whose number one albums have nearly all been about the problems faced by men and women and/or lovers in communicating with each other, and it ends, to all intents and purposes, with the notion that it is the medium itself which is the true evil, a declaration of intent by somebody – Rea in 1989 was thirty-eight years old – who has lived through all of Then Play Long and knows the whole story. The story of pop and rock music only really concerned with alerting its very young audience to an adult world. An era which may prove to be, as the Descendants have it, rotten to the core. And you realise why Rea might have been so keen to get his wife and kids over to Texas – as Americans glance at them on their long, endless highways and retort: “well, why do you think we left Britain in the first place?” – or anywhere that’s far, far away from evil people like Thatcher, Savile, Sutcliffe, Gadd, a country rotting because of its very own and deeply perverted traditions. And yet there is still hope. The half-Scottish Joe Strummer pointedly called his best  song “This Is England.” And while many might still view the road to Budapest as the road to Hell, maybe that signifies a major turnaround in how people are prepared to act towards their fellow humans. Perhaps the corporate media’s bluff has been fatally called; get away from television, newspapers, the internet, and realise that you can still make your own decisions about how the world operates. Strip away the neoliberal gaffa tape and you’ll find ordinary, generous and welcoming people beneath. CONCLUSION As the cover of this album clearly demonstrates, our world doesn't have to be compacted into profitable garbage like a spent car, and even in the darkest of corners, there always lurks a rainbow.

0324_3bfc9cf1-ca9e-4369-832b-234559ce568e	It’s the end of another Celebrity Big Brother series on Channel 5. This edition featured a UK vs USA theme which has delivered moments of high drama and genuine hilarity. We look back at five standout moments. \n Jenna Jameson and Farrah Abraham (Channel 5) 1. Jarrah’s fake eviction and return  \nThe twist-within-a-twist that saw US stars Farrah Abraham and Jenna Jameson voted into a luxury secret suite to spy on their former housemates was, hands down, the highlight of this series. \n \nThe pair, who had become firm friends, were ecstatic at being reunited. Under the false impression their individual popularity had swayed the vote, the two Americans repeatedly gushed their thanks to the British voting public. \n  \nThis twist is already brilliant. Here’s even more fallout: http://t.co/EeCl2hpRz7  #CBB  pic.twitter.com/JqAW44RUPx \n \n— Big Brother UK (@bbuk) September 12, 2015 \n \n“We love you guys so much! You have no idea!” cried Farrah. “We love you!” exclaimed Jenna. In actual fact, viewers loathed their cattiness towards fellow housemates; the joke was on them, but they didn’t know it at the time. \n \nBig Brother told the girls they’d live in opulence while keeping an eye on the house and having the power to decide who’d be next to face the public vote for eviction. \n   Promoted stories   \nOr so they thought. \n  \nSHOCKER! Big Brother has revealed the twist to the housemates. See how they react: http://t.co/gryA2ibMwi  #CBB  pic.twitter.com/XcCiacUj9i \n \n— Big Brother UK (@bbuk) September 12, 2015 \n \nIn reality, their nomination choices gave the housemates selected immunity from eviction. \n \nBig Brother further stirred the pot by letting the house in on the fake eviction secret; the only way to save themselves was to get nominated, and in order to get nominated, housemates would have to be as nasty as possible while Jarrah, as the two women dubbed themselves, were eavesdropping. \n  \nJARRAH IS BACK! We're over on @Channel5_tv , any minute now and you DON'T wanna miss it… #CBB  https://t.co/TIdMBnCaqV \n \n— Big Brother UK (@bbuk) September 14, 2015 \n  \nIt was cruel, but oh-so-funny and led to antics deliberately designed to bait the two women such as supermodel Janice Dickinson caking herself in their make-up. \n \nWhen Jenna and Farrah eventually returned to the house, Big Brother ordered everyone to act surprised. \n [embedded content] \nJarrah were told to publicly announce their nominations and, firmly believing fellow American Austin Armacost, Atomic Kitten Natasha Hamilton, funnyman Bobby Davro and The Apprentice’s James Hill were doomed, Farrah and Jenna gloated as they named their choices. \n \nBig Brother then revealed the twist-within-a-twist as Jarrah’s faces dropped to Australia. It was truly TV gold. \n 2. James and Austin’s bromance  \nBig Brother has sparked a number of romances over the years, but it’s the friendship between Austin Armacost (most famous for being an ex-boyfriend of fashion designer Marc Jacobs) and The Apprentice’s ladies’ man James Hill that has been the defining relationship of this series of CBB. \n Celebrity Big Brother’s James Hill and Austin Armacost (Channel 5) \nIt’s been fascinating to watch James and Austin’s friendship play out live on air. \n (Channel 5) \nFans have been loving the bromance. \n  \nIt's the most unlikely friendship but such a lovely relationship x #cbb  #James &Austin \n \n— Sally Ann Matthews (@SallyAnMatthews) September 21, 2015 \n  \nEverytime James and Austin fight I'm like jus' kiiiiiiiiiiiiss #cbb \n \n— Nick Bond (@bondnickbond) September 21, 2015 \n  \nWhat's going on with James and Austin?? Austin is married and James isn't gay… I love watching this though!!! #CBB \n \n— Luisa Zissman (@TheLuluLife) September 18, 2015 \n  \nAre you loving James and Austin's bromance? #CBB  https://t.co/7vBy6X5Gpt \n \n— Channel 5 (@channel5_tv) September 15, 2015 \n \nWill they be able to take their friendship out of the confines of the Big Brother house and into the real world? Fans will have to wait and see. \n 3. Stevi and Chloe-Jasmine’s bizarre romance  \nAn X Factor wedding looks set to happen after this couple, who found love on the show, got engaged. \n Chloe-Jasmine Whichello and Stevi Ritchie (Channel 5) \nChloe-Jasmine Whichello and Stevi Ritchie met when they were contestants on the ITV talent show in 2014. But living in the CBB house has given viewers a flavour of their relationship, and the more cynical are convinced this hook-up is a “showmance” designed for lucrative magazine deals. \n  \nOmg Chloe-Jasmin. Such a drama queen. Her and Stevi's relationship is also a fake!! #CBBUK \n \n— Sonya Innes (@marshall_sonya) September 16, 2015 \n  \nChloe Jasmin and Stevi's relationship is so fake its actually laughable who holds hands that much in a day \n \n— Taylor (@taylorhawkinsx) August 29, 2015 \n \nWorking class Stevi and posh Chloe-Jasmine are as unlikely and odd a match as having apple crumble with Marmite, and even Big Brother presenter Emma Willis cast doubt on their union, saying she “wasn’t sure” about them when she appeared on sister show Celebrity Big Brother’s Bit On The Side. \n  \nOh dear!  Chloe jasmin and Stevi Richie omg serious serious cringe it's uncomfortable to watch #pda  #CBBUK  #Channel5 \n \n— charlotte weston (@pottylottie) September 2, 2015 \n  \nI cringe far too much at Stevi and Chloe-Jasmin  stop! \n \n— Stevie! (@OfficialStee) August 30, 2015 \n \nThe couple’s toe-curling public displays of affection have annoyed most of their fellow housemates and made viewers cringe. \n \nAnd exactly what was Chloe-Jasmine doing to Stevi that made him audibly moan and groan when they disappeared to the bathroom for some “alone time”? We shudder to think. \n 4. Bobby Davro’s arachnophobia  \nWho knew the comedian was so scared of spiders? While relaxing with Stevi in the tower, Bobby spotted one of the eight-legged creatures and revealed his fear of them to the X Factor star. \n Bobby Davro in Celebrity Big Brother (Jon Enoch/Channel Five) \nStevi told Bobby he’d handle it… and then asked TV presenter Gail Porter for assistance! \n [embedded content] \nThe two men stood back while the 44-year-old scooped up the spider, but a terrified Bobby screamed when he spotted it on her back. \n Bobby Davro (Channel 5) \nThe funny man would be absolutely useless in ITV’s jungle series I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! so stick a tenner on him appearing at some point in the future. \n 5. Tila Tequila’s exit  \nJust one day after the latest series got under way, the 33-year-old glamour model was removed from the house for allegedly posting a series of anti-Semitic remarks online. \n \nA Channel 5 spokesman said: “Unfortunately, Channel 5 and Endemol did not know about the views and attitudes Tila had expressed in social media postings prior to her involvement in Celebrity Big Brother. \n Tila Tequila was booted off Celebrity Big Brother (Ian West/PA) \n“When they were brought to our attention, she was called to the Diary Room for a discussion with producers and was subsequently removed from the house. \n \n“The views Tila had expressed, and permitted to remain uncorrected, are totally unacceptable and, accordingly, her continued involvement in the programme was untenable.” \n   \n Share article  \n   [embedded content] \nThe Playboy model, whose real name is Thien Thanh Thi Nguyen, was born in Singapore to Vietnamese parents. She is best known for her bisexual-themed dating show, A Shot At Love With Tila Tequila.
0325_4fe3d448-a6ad-41f6-ba07-81745825a193	Bristol Palin is at it again! Sarah Palin's daughter took to her Patheos blog -- the same place where she posted the world's least enthused pregnancy announcement -- to blast Obama for encouraging kids to get interested in science and engineering. Earlier this week, 14-year-old Muslim boy Ahmed Mohamed was arrested in Texas for bringing a homemade clock to school. His English teacher thought the home electrical wiring was a bomb and called the police, who detained the boy for over an hour before calling his parents. President Barack Obama responded to the injustice by sending Mohamed a supportive tweet that praised his skills. Bristol Palin posts pregnancy selfie "Cool clock, Ahmed," Obama tweeted from his @POTUS account. "Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great." \nCool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.— President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015 \nCute and unobjectionable, right? WRONG. Let the former abstinence spokesperson having her second child out of wedlock set you straight. "This is the kind of stuff Obama needs to STAY out of," she fumed. "This encourages more racial strife that is already going on with the 'Black Lives Matter' crowd and encourages victimhood." "The police made a mistake, clearly," she continued. "But why put more people against them? Why egg it on? Childish games like this from our president have divided our country... even more today than when he was elected." In Palin's eyes, Obama congratulating a student and broadly encouraging science without mentioning his race, his religion or the police at all is "egging on" anti-police protesters. But flat-out saying the police made a mistake -- as she did earlier -- isn't? Glad we got that cleared up.

0326_ec0dfe82-30b0-4017-8c33-258e2b2d7e35	Relatives of Chinese dissidents were set to meet Wednesday with the No. 2 U.S. diplomat as the Obama administration sought to demonstrate it won't gloss over human rights during this week's state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping.  \n \nBut the message was in danger of backfiring after the wife of one prominent dissident, Gao Zhisheng, who says he was tortured with an electric baton during years of solitary confinement, refused the invitation.  \n \n"They haven't talked to us in five years, for all the time we've been here, so why should we attend a meeting now?" Geng He told The Associated Press from her home in Cupertino, Calif. Gao himself vows to never leave China despite the hardships and having to live apart from his family.  \n \nThe United States has warned that the toughest crackdown in years on Chinese activists threatens to cloud the high-profile visit by Xi, who arrives in Washington on Thursday and will meet with President Barack Obama.  \n \nYet the issue of human rights is unlikely to dominate the agenda at their Oval Office meeting Friday, which is followed by a state dinner.  \n \nAs China emerges as an economic and military rival that Washington both competes and cooperates with, other issues tend to get top billing at the summit table. Prime U.S. concerns are cybercrime, China's island-building in the disputed South China Sea and building momentum for a global deal to combat climate change.  \n \nDeputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that human rights would get attention. National Security Adviser Susan Rice met Tuesday with representatives of civil society organizations to discuss draft legislation in China that could hamper the work of international and Chinese groups.  \n \n"We believe that people should have the right to speak freely. We believe that journalists and NGOs (nongovernment organizations) should be able to operate freely, and we are going to be very clear about that not just with China but with any country in the world," Rhodes said.  \n \nForeign governments have, for the most part, become less willing to speak out over rights abuses as China's economic heft has grown. But in a move that will annoy Beijing, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to meet Wednesday afternoon with relatives of several Chinese dissidents and civil society activists.  \n \nBut human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng opposed his wife Geng taking part. Geng on Tuesday posted on her Twitter account a letter from her husband telling her that such a meeting would be futile while U.S. politicians rub shoulders with the head of China's ruling Communist Party.  \n \nGao detailed in an AP interview, his first in five years, the torture and other mistreatment he faced before his release in August 2014. At the time of his release he was barely able to speak or walk and still lives under near-constant guard.  \n \nGeng wants her husband's case to be raised in talks between Xi and Obama, but has little hope it will be.  \n \n"I think talk about trade, economic relations cannot be separated from human rights. They should put human rights at the front of the conversation, but I don't think they are willing to do that," Geng said.  \n \nSince taking the presidency in 2013 and becoming the most powerful Chinese leader in three decades, Xi has cracked down on encroachment of what he views as Western-style freedoms in China's increasingly prosperous and connected society. His administration has tightened controls on religious minorities, including a government campaign to remove crosses and demolish Christian churches in an eastern province -- a move that has drawn condemnation on Capitol Hill.  \n \nThe Obama administration is under pressure from Congress and an array of rights activists to speak out. Ten senators have voiced concern over Xi's "extraordinary assault" on civil society ahead of the pomp-filled summit. This summer, Chinese authorities rounded up more than 250 human rights lawyers and associates. According to Human Rights Watch, 22 are still held.  \n \nDemocratic Rep. Jim McGovern, co-chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, said he and several other lawmakers will host Chinese activists and former political prisoners Friday to pay tribute to them and send a message to both the Chinese and U.S. governments that human rights matter to the American people.  \n \nBut the topic shapes the relationship less than it did a quarter-century ago. When China cracked down on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, killing hundreds, it had direct and negative consequences as the U.S. scaled down ties.  \n \nAlthough Chinese society has opened up since then, the Communist Party retains a monopoly on political power. According to the State Department, there are tens of thousands of political prisoners. They include Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the year after Obama. Liu is serving 11 years in prison after calling for democratic reforms.  \n \nA dozen Nobel peace laureates, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have written to Obama urging him when he meets Xi to call publicly for the release of Liu and his wife Liu Xia, who is under house arrest.
0327_673d98b7-fd23-419e-81fb-12179801ce82	For many people today the word “retirement” is synonymous with another: “freedom”. The freedom, after decades of work, to get up when you want, to choose how you will spend your day and to travel the world. But while some members of the third age economy are lucky enough to enjoy just such a lifestyle when they retire, others will struggle to make ends meet. We spoke to three 70-year-olds on different incomes to find out what life in retirement is really like in 2015.\n‘I live within my means, and sometimes I even manage to save a little’ Liz Grant retired 10 years ago from her full-time job as a teacher, but continued teaching part-time until she was 67. She lives alone in a three-bed house in Northenden, a suburb of Manchester. She receives a final salary teacher’s pension of £11,000 a year, plus a state pension of £5,000 a year, bringing her annual income to £16,000. “For years I was a single mother bringing up four children. We didn’t have a lot of money – just my teacher’s salary – so I learned to be economical. But as you get older your needs become smaller. I had no mortgage by the time I retired at 60, and my children had all left home. I have very little need of money nowadays,” she says. “I live within my means, and sometimes I even manage to save a little bit. I don’t penny pinch, I just know how to shop for a bargain and to recognise good value. Plus, I cook from scratch and I bake.” Grant spends three to four hours each day volunteering for a National Lottery-funded charity called Real Food Wythenshawe, which encourages local residents to grow and cook fresh food. “I like sharing my skills with young people in the local community, learning new skills from them and giving something back. I can afford to do it, and I enjoy it. It keeps my mind active,” she says. Shortly after she retired Grant decided to downsize, so she could share her property wealth with her children. “I sold my four-bed house in the more prestigious area of Chorlton for £450,000 and bought my current place for £260,000. “I gave £50,000 to each of my two eldest children, and invested the rest so I can help the other two as well, when they’re older. My bills are smaller now, and I still manage to go on holiday and have a good lifestyle. I don’t have any money worries. I consider myself to be very, very lucky.” ‘If the state pension didn’t exist, I’d have had it’ David Eton retired five years ago from his job in catering. He lives in north London with his wife, a care assistant, and her teenage daughter. His main source of income is the state pension –£152 a week – and, after he suffered a stroke, a heart attack and a crippling back injury, disability benefit of £300 a month, which is a total of £11,504 a year. He has no savings and his one-bedroom flat (his wife’s daughter sleeps in the front room) is owned by a housing association. “I spent my life working 12-hour days as a chef. I was a casual worker never knowing if I’d have a job from one week to the other. I earned just enough to pay my bills. “You never thought about your pension in those days. Today, they tell you to save for one – but not then. And no one I worked for put anything aside for me. I got my wages, and that was it. If the state pension didn’t exist, I’d have to go around begging. I’d have had it.” Unable to walk more than 10 yards unaided, his biggest expense is his car, which costs him £240 a month in loan repayments. “I need the car to go to hospital and church, but I hate being in debt.” After paying for car insurance, hospital car parking charges, petrol, home contents insurance, water, gas, electricity and his TV licence, Eton is left with just £35 a week to live on. “Once a pound is gone you’re never going to get it back, so I try to spend it wisely. For example, I’ll shop for a £2 or £3 chicken at the supermarket, usually in the evening when they start reducing their prices, then make it into a casserole. That will last us two or three days. Otherwise, I don’t go out much. I keep myself busy in the garden.” His last holiday was in 2001, but he says what depresses him the most is being unable to afford an occasional beer in a pub. “Things are a lot more expensive than they used to be. It’s very hard. You work all your life and then it feels like you are on your own. I used to worry a lot about paying my bills. I would get angina. Now they give me pills to help with my anxiety, because I can’t do anything about it, can I? Life is what it is.” ‘We have more money than our annual needs. We enjoy life’ Colin Evans retired from his job as a financial adviser at 57, due to ill health. A few years later he met his now wife, Annette, and the couple moved to Cyprus in 2008. Their total annual income from pensions is £38,000 a year. “Most of my income comes from private pensions I started saving into in my early 30s,” says Evans. “Fortunately, I’d had the good sense to buy pensions with guaranteed annuity rates of 10.5%. By today’s standards that’s an insanely high rate, but it wasn’t at the time.” As well as his private pensions, Evans receives the state pension and more than £2,000 a year from an old employer: “That’s more than I used to receive in salary when I worked for them, thanks to a final salary scheme.” The couple decided to move to Cyprus after spending some time in the village of Mandria on holiday. “It’s right by the beach, and when I first saw it I thought I’d died and gone to heaven. It was so quiet and peaceful,” says Evans. They paid about £150,000 in cash for a house, using the proceeds of their property in the UK. “You get a much better quality of life and cheaper bills too. Our council tax is just £150 a year and our electricity and water bills come to about £51 a month in total. We spend the same amount on food as we would in England, only it’s fresher and mostly grown in the fields around us.” His top financial priority is to get the best rate when he exchanges his pension income from the UK into euros. He says a recent find, the website Transferwise, has saved him about £1,000 so far this year. Overall, Evans says he doesn’t have any financial worries. “We go back to the UK at least once a year to visit children and grandchildren, and have another holiday abroad every year as well. Because of the provisions we made for our old age during our working lives, we have more money than our annual needs. Now, we get to enjoy life.”

0329_f6e3d2d6-f0a6-46ea-a3ab-0026b972662d	In what is without a doubt the most bizarre story you'll read today, a woman who found out her 'boyfriend' was actually her best mate wearing a strap on penis has been taken to court.  \n \nA woman - who can't be named for legal reasons - randomly got a friend request on Facebook back in 2011 from somebody called 'Kye Fortune'. \n \nThey chatted for a while and she found out that 'Kye' was a half-Filipino, half-Latino young man who had been involved in a car accident which had left him with terrible scars that he was embarrassed about. Doctors had also found a brain tumour, apparently.  \n \nThey spoke on the phone, and the alleged victim did question why his voice was so high but was told that it was due to his Filipino background.  \n \n\n  He was saying how much I had helped him get through his illness. (He said) it was a sign, we should get married, we should have kids, we were going to do all sorts of things. The complainant told police   \n'Kye' was hesitant to meet up in person, but eventually they did. However, the complainant was required to wear a blindfold. They then proceeded to have sex.  \n \nThey continued to meet up at hotels, but each time the alleged victim had to wear the blindfold. The last time they met up was when Kye visited her flat.  \n   When I was having sex I grabbed for the back of his head and my hand got caught on something. It did not feel right. I was sat on the bed, he was standing up. Something in my mind said 'pull it (the blindfold) off, pull it off'. The complainant   \nWhen she pulled off the blindfold, she couldn't believe her eyes, her best friend Gayle Newland was standing in front of her. 'Kye' had introduced the pair and they'd become close.  \n   I just pulled it off. Gayle was just standing there ... I just couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it. Straight away she held her hand down over her face and said 'it's not what you think'. \n   \nApparently, Newland had been using  a strap-on and concealed her hair with a hat. She also bandaged down her breasts to pass off as a bloke.  \n \nAfter the event, the complainant sent a barrage of texts to Newland regarding what had happened. \n   How could you do this to me for two years? You have been a fake, you have manipulated me. Fake life, fake love. Are you for real? You should be locked up for what you have done. You really are a piece of work. I have just one question, why me?' \n  \nThe prosecutor asked why she had written those messages, and the alleged victim explained that she felt betrayed.  \n   Because I was angry. I had just found out that the person I thought I was in a relationship with… not only (were) they not that person, it was a female. Someone completely different. The alleged victim   \nNewland denies any wrongdoing and the case continues.

0333_a1c3c39d-3cf9-4c70-8263-023796035160	Many Australians are keen to share their homes with refugees who will arrive in the emergency intake announced this week. \n\nThey have two spare bedrooms, a penchant for Sri Lankan cooking and benevolent hearts – and the Melbourne couple want to open their home to Syrian refugees.\n\nCallum Dittmar, 32, and his wife Naomi Wijeyesekera, 30, are among scores of Australian households keen to share their homes with those who need it.\n\nOn Thursday, Treasurer Joe Hockey said it might take more than two years to resettle in Australia all of the 12,000-Syrian-refugee intake announced this week, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott refused to include refugees languishing in offshore detention in the emergency intake.\n\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said the government was working with the states and territories, as well as churches and community groups, on the best way to house the refugees — the largest intake in a single year since World War II.\n\nFederal MPs have received calls from constituents wanting to host refugees in their homes, and the website enoughRoom.org has been set up to match hosts with refugees.\n\nMr Dittmar, an IT worker from Sydenham, was moved by the scale of the Syrian humanitarian crisis and feels "an obligation to help".\n\n"I live in a three-bedroom house, we've got a couple of spare bedrooms. I could host them for as long as needed, until they were settled," he said.\n\nHe said he and his wife would help refugees access services, food and clothes.\n\n"My wife is of Sri Lankan heritage so they are likely to get a Sri Lankan meal before they get Australian cuisine," he said.\n\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison said he was heartened by the support being offered to Syrian refugees.\n\n"[The] government will be working closely with our settlement service providers, Syrian and Iraqi community groups to determine how best to accommodate the generous contributions and support Australians are seeking to give," he said.\n\nIn May 2012 under Labor, families were eligible for a small stipend to provide short-term homestay accommodation to asylum seekers moving out of detention on bridging visas.\n\nMr Morrison, then the opposition immigration spokesman, expressed concern over the plan, saying it was reckless to "place asylum seekers in suburban homes and communities, where there is no consultation with neighbours or the police".\n\nAMES Australia chief executive Cath Scarth, whose organisation helps resettle refugees, said homestays were "a fantastic idea" but must be well executed.\n\n"Any program to have people host refugees would have to be properly supported with appropriate cultural information and counselling," she said, adding police checks should be run on hosts and refugees should be comfortable with the arrangement.\n\nAMES is in talks with the Victorian and federal government about the concept, which would also involve councils, Ms Scarth said.\n\nOn Thursday Mr Hockey said the resettlement costs would depend on "the speed in which we can process applications.\n\n"There are some estimates that we could do it in a two-year period. There are some estimates that it may take a little bit longer," he said.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, Mr Abbott insisted Syrian asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island detention centres would not be resettled as part of the intake because that would encourage "the evil trade of people smuggling".\n\nHe said there was a "world of difference" between the refugees to be accepted and those from the same countries who have spent more than two years in offshore detention.\n\nFollow us on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0334_c16d052e-0059-48ad-abbf-aeeb2934fab0	The family of murdered bride Anni Dewani have called on her husband to "be a man" and give them answers after a coroner questioned whether there should be an inquest into her death. \n \n\t\t \nMillionaire businessman Shrien Dewani was cleared last year of orchestrating the honeymoon killing of his 28-year-old wife, who was fatally shot as the couple drove through the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa, on November 14 2010. \n  Anni Dewani was murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa   \nHer father, Vinod Hindocha, 66, and uncle, Ashok Hindocha, 55, appeared at North London Coroner's Court today to argue that Mr Dewani should answer their questions about his version of events at an inquest. \n\n\t\t\t \nCoroner Andrew Walker told them Mr Dewani has a right not to incriminate himself, raising doubts over whether an inquest should take place. \n\n\n\n \nBut he agreed to send Mr Dewani the family's questions and ask whether he would be willing to answer them. \n\nSpeaking outside court afterwards, Vinod Hindocha said: "I would say (to Mr Dewani) 'Be a man and come forward and say something'." \n\nAsked if he would ever get the answers he is looking for, he said: "I don't think so but I hope so, I hope I get closure." \n\nHis brother Ashok said: "We have 10 or 15 questions that we need to be answered. \n\n\t\t\t \n"That is then up to Shrien Dewani if he wants the family to suffer more, if he has any pleasure in doing so. \n\n"Whether or not we get the answers, we will keep on trying until the day I die." \n\nThe relatives said they still have "other options" if the inquest does not go ahead but declined to say whether they would sue Mr Dewani. \n\nThe 34-year-old was extradited to South Africa last year but the case collapsed after a judge found that it was "riddled with inconsistencies". \n\n\t\t\t \nIt meant he walked free before having to give evidence and he has never spoken publicly about what happened. \n\nIn a statement read out to the court, Mr Dewani described himself as "bisexual" and admitted he had slept with male prostitutes. \n\nA key witness for the prosecution was a male escort who went by the name The German Master, but his evidence was ruled inadmissible. \n\nThree men - Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - were given jail terms for their role in Mrs Dewani's killing. \n\nAshok Hindocha told today's hearing that there were discrepancies between what Mr Dewani had told the family, the press and the South African police. \n\n\t\t\t \nAsked why the family wanted an inquest to go ahead, he said: "The main reason is that we would like to know what really happened. \n\n"The motive of this case was never properly heard in South Africa. \n\n"Members of Scotland Yard and other witnesses never got a chance to speak because the judge thought it was not important - if he (Mr Dewani) is gay or bisexual, she didn't want to know about that. \n\n"So there is an issue about the motive." \n\nMr Walker told the family that an inquest would be further hampered because he does not have the power to call witnesses from South Africa. \n\nHe said: "My view, members of the family, is that in these circumstances it would serve no purpose to hold an inquest because I would not be able to answer the questions that an inquest sets out to answer. \n\n"I'm going to direct that your questions are sent to Mr Dewani and Mr Dewani is to indicate whether he would be prepared to answer those questions." \n\nAnother hearing is expected to take place on October 9. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
0335_f11b2776-86dc-4bb4-b3e0-ed26cfda9316	By Tim Lammers, DirectConversations.com \n\nAs legendary director Ridley Scott found out filming "The Martian," making a movie about Mars does have its privileges -- especially when NASA personnel are major consultants. \n\nThat's because while the space agency revealed to the world Monday that there's running water on the Red Planet, Scott and his "Martian" team got early word about the discovery. \n \n"They told us months ago," Scott told me in a phone conversation a few hours after the announcement. "We've had several casual meetings with NASA making the film. They've talked about several big slabs that looked like white rock that appeared and disappeared, and actually what they realized it was, was ice. Of course, they just made the official statement that it was ice, and therefore, water. A couple months ago, they thought it was fresh water. This morning, though, they think it's salt water." \n\nOpening in theaters nationwide Friday, "The Martian" follows the arduous plight of astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon), part of a team conducting experiments on Mars when a violent storm hits and sweeps him away before he can get to safety and evacuate the planet with his fellow crew members. Amazingly, Watney survives and is able to sustain himself on the Red Planet, and eventually re-establishes contact with NASA on Earth. But with limited time, resources and potentially harsh, if not deadly, elements, Watney could easily die unless NASA and the members of his crew can defy the odds and attempt a daring rescue mission. \n\nStarring along with Damon is a diverse ensemble that includes Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara and Aksel Hennie as Watney's fellow astronauts, and Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Donald Glover and Mackenzie Davis among the NASA personnel guiding them. \n\nScott, of course, is no stranger to science fiction, having directed such genre classics as "Alien" and "Blade Runner." The exciting thing for him is, what is considered science fiction today with a film like "The Martian," could very well be science fact tomorrow -- especially since the science of Watney's survival and the mathematics behind the conceivable rescue mission to Mars is in theory -- and much, much more -- quantifiable. \n\nUltimately, presenting plausible scenarios is Scott's way of showing his respect for his audiences' intelligence, instead of relying solely on visceral visual effects to entertain them. \n\n"It's always great when an audience can walk away, saying, 'I've learned something' or asking, 'Is that true?' That is cinema at its best," Scott said, humbly. "We need to keep raising the bar." \n\nAnd Scott believes those visions have a better shot at becoming reality -- but it's going to take a collaborative effort. \n\n"You can be optimistic, but you can't ever assume it will happen if you don't have the budget it would take to get to Mars," Scott said. "I still question why it can't be an international joint effort, and therefore, share costs. That would make more sense. You could even share the crew. You take the best of the best and off they go." \n\nThe great thing is, said Scott, is that going to Mars isn't about landing there to say we've done it. Before realizing dreams of living there, there is the possibility that Martian resources could be retrieved to help us here on Earth.   \n\n"We're not mining there yet, but I've seen discussions of going to the nearest places," Scott said. "The only practical ones, really, are either the moon or Mars because everything beyond that is a quantum jump into astrophysics and hibernation. Mars probably has massive mineral wealth and capabilities, but whether it's practical enough to ship it down to Earth, I'm not sure about that." \n\nKeeping atmosphere light \n\nWhile the circumstances are dire in "The Martian," Scott injects plenty of humor into the film and for right reason. Ultimately, life isn't made up of entirely serious moments or humorous moments, but both -- and without humor, Watney might not have the wherewithal to survive alone, Scott said. \n\n"You have to sometimes take a humorous stance to help you through certain situations, and I think that's what we see with Mark Watney. He has to take on a humorous stance or else he would lose it," Scott said. \n\nThat's not to say Watney isn't serious about his situation. He very much is, and he has the courage in "The Martian" that harks a classic space film, Scott said. \n\n"There's a film that I like quite a lot called 'The Right Stuff,' which relates to courage -- courage under fire. You can't weaken and have to utilize your inward strengths to see you through," Scott said. "Courage under pressure is in the film, but it's a life lesson as well." \n\nScott plans to return to space soon, in the cinematic sense, of course, with "Alien: Paradise Lost," a sequel to his 2012 sci-fi hit "Prometheus" pegged for a 2017 release. After that, considering the director turns 78 in November, retirement hardly seems like an option. \n\nTo man, retirement means time for taking vacations, but truth be told, Scott's been taking trips here and across the universe for nearly 40 years through his experiences as a filmmaker. \n\n"Once I finished 'The Martian,' I felt like I'd been to Mars. People ask if me if I'd like to go there for real and I say, 'No, I like it here,'" Scott said with a laugh. "But you really do feel like you've been there once you finished prepping, shooting and post production. That's the beauty of filmmaking, you know. You get to go to the 18th century, you get to go to the future and you get to go to the present in some other forms. That's why I love what I do." \n\nT im Lammers is a nationally syndicated movie reporter and author of "Direct Conversations: The Animated Films of Tim Burton" (Foreword by Tim Burton)."
0336_cd4464f1-5701-4d90-95d8-35c1e4240982	FRANK SCULLY 1920–2015\n\nIf you asked Frank Scully how he was, he would always reply: "All the better for seeing you". And he meant it. The former ALP politician, and champion of many causes, was also an avid Richmond Tigers man – and the club song rang out as Scully's coffin left the church after his funeral.\n\nFrancis Raymond Scully was born in Bendigo on January 27, 1920. The family moved to Burnley in 1929, and Frank went to St Ignatius Boys' School in Richmond. \n\nHis political career started after he joined the Victorian Railways in 1935, aged 15. He became a leading shunter in the Melbourne yard, and acting foreman, and the 1940s became involved with the ALP industrial groups fighting the Communists who dominated the Australian Railways' Union.\n\nIn 1949, Scully was preselected as the Australian Labor Party candidate for the state seat of Richmond, which he won and held for the party until 1954. In 1957, he married Moira Grant.\n\nHe was secretary to cabinet in the Cain Labor government, and was one of the "Grouper" MPs, conservative Catholics who broke with the ALP in 1955 and joined the anti-communist movement, which eventually became the Democratic Labour Party.\n\nDr Herbert Vere Evatt​, then the federal opposition leader trying to defeat Robert Menzies' conservative government, attacked the Groupers and many left or were expelled, including Scully.\n\nAt the 1955 election, Scully was only one of the 17 expelled members to hold their seats, which he lost in 1958 to an Evatt Labor candidate, but he made political history as the last lower house DLP member in the state of Victoria.\n\nScully championed causes including the Co-Operation Act 1953, which paved the way for housing societies and credit unions. He also intervened to stop the practice of Catholic school children not being able to travel to school on government buses during the height of sectarianism in the 1950s.\n\nScully was an active member of the National Civic Council and involved in the Catholic Young Men's Society. He was secretary of the Young Labor Association for many years, as well as secretary of the South Richmond branch of the ALP.\n\nAfter losing his parliamentary seat, Scully first bought a newsagency business in Yea then moved to Sandringham and bought another newsagency.\n\nFrank and Moira were involved with local organisations, and Frank was a member of the Knights of the Southern Cross, Rotary and Probus Clubs.

0339_8afc2c0b-b7c8-4f8d-b98b-382d36e5f512	Though they might publicly suggest otherwise, it's hard to imagine members of the Sparks really envisioned making the playoffs after losing their first seven games of the season, or when their record stood at 3-14. \n\nBut the Sparks did make the playoffs, where they'll face off against the top-seeded team in the Western Conference, the Minnesota Lynx, in a best-of-three series beginning Friday night. \n\nThe team's turnaround — they won 11 of their final 17 contests — can be attributed primarily to the return of two players: Candace Parker and Alana Beard. \n\nParker sat out the first 17 games of the WNBA season because, at 29 years old, constantly switching between domestic and international leagues, she was exhausted. \n\n"I just knew for me to be at my top game, I needed the rest," the two-time most valuable player said. "Physically, mentally, I had been playing year-round for six, seven years." \n\nThat rest seems to have paid off for both Parker and the Sparks. In 16 appearances, she led the team in points per game (19.4), rebounds (10.1), assists (6.3), and steals. \n \n"She's been extremely influential in what's happened since she's been back," Coach Brian Agler said. "It's not just ironic that this happened. She really impacted this situation with her play." \n\nBeard, meanwhile, battled plantar fasciitis that limited her to 14 games, mostly during the second half of the team's playoff push. At 33 years old, she's no longer at the same level that made her a four-time All-Star, but her veteran presence, coupled with the steady play of Nneka Ogwumike (16.5 points, 7.3 rebounds), Jantel Lavender, and Kristi Toliver was enough to salvage what looked like a lost season. Parker believes the slow start and solid finish could actually aid them in the postseason. \n  \n"In years past, we've kind of peaked too soon and were not playing very well going into the playoffs," Parker said. "I think this year is definitely the opposite." \n\nThe Sparks are the only team left with a losing record overall (14-20), but Agler believes this is the most wide-open WNBA race in recent memory, thanks to a series of unusual circumstances. \n \n"There are teams that have better records than others, but injuries have plagued teams this year, late arrivals have plagued teams, there's been trades that have impacted both the Eastern and Western Conferences," Agler said. "So in the end, it's very balanced in regards to how the teams are playing at the moment. It could be an extremely competitive and interesting playoffs." \n\nThat being said, the Sparks won't be discounting their first-round opponents in the Lynx, who went 22-12 despite a brutal run of injuries to some of their own most important players. Guards Lindsay Whalen and Seimone Augustus missed chunks of August and September, but they are expected to return Friday, according to the Star Tribune in Minnesota. \n\n"We treat them as a team that's really good and has the best record in the conference," Ogwumike said. "You can't just expect that no one is going to play. We expect that everyone is going to play, so that's how we prepare for the team." \n\nThe Lynx have one of the most talented starting fives in the WNBA, anchored by the aforementioned backcourt, plus Rebekkah Brunson, midseason acquisition Sylvia Fowles, and All-Star Maya Moore. Moore was the runner-up for the MVP award after putting up 20.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 3.5 assists a game. \n\n"You have to stay in her space," Agler said of the talented Minnesota forward. "You have to be with her on every catch. She's an extremely smart basketball player with and without the basketball, but what makes her difficult to defend is she has a lot of really good players around her too, so you just can't put your total focus on her." \n\nNow that they're finally healthy, the wild card for the Sparks might be their first-year coach, who won a title with the Seattle Storm in 2010. Parker is confident her teammates have bought in to what Agler can contribute. \n\n"He's won a WNBA championship, and I think it's just about trust and being on the same page," Parker said. "I think we are. He's very knowledgeable about the game. We trust him and we trust each other, and that's the key." \n\nalex.shultz@latimes.com \n Copyright © 2015, Los Angeles Times
0340_d6c3beb0-c929-4668-b403-21ccabbada4c	If you're one of the serious Republican candidates for the presidency, what do you do tonight about Donald Trump?\nThe temptation is for everybody to gang up on him. That won't work. His support is irrational, and essentially emotional; if his followers perceive that he's being "picked on" (oh, the irony!) they'll probably just rally around him. And as we know, it doesn't matter how much of an ass Trump makes of himself; the more like a spoiled three year-old he acts, the better his supporters will like it. It's no use goading him into exposing the "real" Donald Trump; that's been on display all along and- somehow- his supporters actually like it. Despite Jerry Seinfeld's sage advice to treat Trump's lack of manners as the problem and focus on the psychological problems that make him apparently incapable of playing well with others (especially women), once again, this assumes that the audience is being rational. The whole problem is that, at this stage, they're not.\nBobby Jindal points out that when it comes to policy, Trump- not to put too fine a point on it- has absolutely no idea what the hell he's talking about. All Trump is really pushing is Trump. It's an ego trip. Again, there's a real question as to how many of the people who support old Tribble Head really care about anything of substance. Their support of Trump is the equivalent of a collective tantrum. The only positive here is that I still believe that the American public- and that includes many even of those who support The Donald at this point- are not stupid enough to actually let the guy get anywhere near the Republican nomination. Running against Trump is the one thing which would certainly save Hillary at this point; as one aide to another GOP candidate said this week, Trump would be lucky to carry a single state. It's tough to think of anything that could be a greater disaster for the Republican party than a Trump nomination. Beyond that, of course, there is no way the American people are going to actually let someone as obviously immature and utterly unqualified anywhere near the presidency. The only way Trump is going to get to the Oval Office is on a guided tour.\nBut it's going to be interesting watching tonight, in an appalling sort of way. Here we have the most talented bunch of potential Republican presidents in a generation, an the rank-and-file is going ga-ga over a childish, egocentric misogynist whose policies are for the most part further out of step with theirs than any of the other candidates and who can't even name the leaders of the most prominent terrorist groups- and excuses his ignorance by saying that "they'll just change, anyway."\nIt's like two trains headed toward each other on the same track, with no indication that either is going to stop. You really should look away. But somehow, you just can't.\nAll you can do is to hope and to pray- and to stay calm and trust the rank-and-file of the Republican party to come to their senses once they actually have to make a decision we're all going to have to live with.
0341_75b0097c-cf1a-49ea-b07c-14ac30aea951	Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign is methodically building a political firewall across the South in hopes of effectively locking up the Democratic nomination in March regardless of any early setbacks in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. \n\nClinton’s advisers, struck by the strength of Sen. Bernie Sanders in those two states, have been assuring worried supporters that victories and superdelegate support in Southern states will help make her the inevitable nominee faster than many Democrats expect. They point to her popularity with black and Hispanic voters, as well as her policy stances and the relationships that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have cultivated. Hillary Clinton was similarly confident at this point eight years ago, before Barack Obama and his superior organizers began piling up delegates, including in many Southern states. \n\nIn interviews, advisers said the campaign was increasingly devoting staff members and money to win the South Carolina primary on Feb. 27 while laying the groundwork to sweep Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia on March 1. Those Super Tuesday states are highlighted in red on maps in the offices of Clinton’s senior aides in New York City. \n\nThe eight primaries will deliver several hundred delegates for Clinton, advisers believe, toward the goal of more than 2,200 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. The campaign is barraging superdelegates in the South with requests for support – sometimes even jumping the gun by sending pledge forms prematurely – in hopes of adding scores of these party leaders who can bring their votes to the Clinton column at the Democratic National Convention. \n\nThe Southern firewall also includes Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and North Carolina, which vote through mid-March. If Clinton wins big in the Michigan and Ohio primaries that month, her advisers and supporters believe, the nomination will essentially be hers (though crossing the total delegate threshold takes time). \n\nClinton’s Southern strategy shows in sharp relief the imprint of the data-driven, organization-focused nature of the Obama 2008 campaign on the Clinton operation. Her aides are committed to keeping their heads down and taking the long view in the face of Clinton’s unstable poll numbers and other headaches. \n\n“There’s so much focus on Iowa and New Hampshire, but Secretary Clinton and her team know that the South will deliver a huge number of delegates that will essentially seal the nomination for her,” said DuBose Porter, the Georgia Democratic Party chairman and a Clinton supporter. \n\nA Southern firewall, which was critical to Bill Clinton in 1992 and, to a lesser extent, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jimmy Carter in 1980, could be scrambled if Hillary Clinton ends up facing a challenge for the nomination from Vice President Joe Biden. Like her, Biden enjoys sizable support among black and Hispanic voters and has been a loyal partner to the nation’s first black president, Obama. (At the same time, some Clinton advisers believe her strength in the South could be a disincentive for Biden to enter the race.) \n\nSanders, who represents Vermont, while far less known among black and Hispanic voters than Clinton, could have the momentum to become a surprise contender in some Southern states if he prevails in Iowa and New Hampshire, said Rep. James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a powerful Democrat there. \n\n“If the headlines out of Iowa and New Hampshire are really bad for Hillary, the South will become more challenging – and even more important as a firewall,” Clyburn said. Referring to federal inquiries related to Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state, he added, “Barring some revelation that we have not seen, I do think Hillary waltzes through South Carolina.” \n\nRobby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, said she had made it an early priority to develop a winning battle plan for the South to follow the campaign’s intense efforts in the earliest primaries and caucuses. \n\nSouthern states will play a far bigger role than usual in this nominating cycle, with most voting by March 15, and black and Hispanic votes will be crucial in many of those Democratic primaries. \n\nEven as polls show declines in the percentage of voters overall who have a favorable opinion of Clinton, she continues to enjoy “tremendous support” from black and Hispanic voters, as Mook put it. The Clinton campaign is building networks of support through the South in part to “reach out and re-earn their support” rather than assume they will favor her over rivals like Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. \n\n“She made it very clear to me that we could not take anything for granted, and that while we needed to understand the importance of being successful in Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada and South Carolina, we needed a strategy that could endure any sort of challenge,” Mook said. “I think she was very clairvoyant from the start that this would be a competitive race.” \n\nAsked if he could see Clinton losing any of the March 1 contests in Southern and border states, Mook did not answer directly, saying, “I’m really excited about the support that we’re holding right now.” \n\nBut he emphasized that the campaign was only starting to build a political fortress in the region, with work ramping up in Virginia and Georgia. He added that the campaign was reaching out to voters across all demographic groups. \n\n“Just because you win among African Americans and Hispanic Americans doesn’t mean you can write off white Americans, and vice versa,” Mook said. \n\nCandidates win delegates based on vote totals, so Sanders and other Clinton rivals can come away from Southern states with delegates even if Clinton wins there. But Clinton delegate counters believe she will be so dominant that she will take the lion’s share of delegates, unlike in 2008, when Obama often earned sizable numbers of delegates with strong wins and close second-place finishes. The South is the most visible of several firewalls that Clinton and her advisers are trying to construct. They are lining up superdelegate endorsements at a brisk pace, with Clinton holding a rally Saturday in the critical state of New Hampshire to highlight the backing of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. \n\nMook said “we’re trying to get every superdelegate” but declined to say how many of the 713 had committed to Clinton. Other Clinton advisers said a sizable fraction had done so – a crucial step toward outpacing Sanders and O’Malley in total delegate support, Democrats noted. (A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee noted, however, that superdelegates are free to change their minds and support another candidate at any time.) \n\n“Clearly the campaign has learned well from its 2008 experience, and there seems to be a lot more outreach these days both at superdelegate level and at ground level,” said Julián Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio who is Obama’s secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \n\nThe outreach has been aggressive. Jon M. Ausman, a longtime Florida superdelegate, said he had received a call from Craig Smith, an old friend who was political director in the Clinton White House and is close to both Clintons. Blanca O’Leary, a Colorado superdelegate, said she had received calls from “top Clinton people” before pledging her support to Clinton. A North Carolina superdelegate, Pat Cotham, said she had recently received phone calls and emails from Clinton aides – including one whose title was the “southern region political states director” and who sent her a pledge form. \n\n“This kind of irritated me,” Cotham said. “He called me and never said anything about signing a document committing to Hillary. Then he sends it to me and wants me to send it back to him signed. Uh, no.” \n\nClinton has taken several more progressive policy positions on immigration and education that could undercut efforts by rivals to peel away her liberal supporters. She is not as far left in her positioning as Sanders, whose views as a self-described democratic socialist could founder in Southern states, some Democrats say. \n\n“Personally, I wouldn’t be surprised if Hillary lost Iowa and loses New Hampshire to Sanders, but then Sanders and his policies will hit a real wall down South,” said Ausman of Florida, who is supporting Clinton. \n\nClinton’s campaign has also embraced the plan of the Democratic National Committee to hold only six televised debates, even though O’Malley and Sanders are pushing for more. Some Clinton supporters wanted even fewer debates, which would have been an even bigger barrier to visibility for the other Democratic candidates. \n\nBut winning primaries is the most important firewall of all, said several Democrats who know from experience. Another Clinton ally, Mondale, the former vice president, credited Super Tuesday victories in Alabama and Georgia in 1984 with keeping him alive against Gary Hart, and he said he believed that Clinton’s strengths with minority voters and working-class white Democrats would provide decisive advantages in the South for her. \n\n“If I hadn’t won in the South, I think I would have lost the nomination, and I think it’s the South that will be the key for Hillary, too,” Mondale said. “If things turn sour in the early states, firewalls can save you, and she will have real advantages down there.”

0345_08fca198-778f-4098-a676-a2b2d31d14b4	Loading ...  \n  \nRepublicans in the US Congress opposing the Iran nuclear agreement are not giving up despite losing to Democrats this week, they are plotting additional attacks to undercut the deal, a report says. \n\nOn Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican resolution to reject the historic Vienna accord between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries, ensuring that the deal can be implemented without Obama having to use his veto power. \n\n“This vote is a victory for diplomacy, for American national security, and for the safety and security of the world,” President Barack Obama said after the vote. \n\nRepublican senators, who only a few months earlier vowed to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto, fell two votes short needed to break a Democratic filibuster. \n\nBut, in the House of Representatives, Republicans succeeded to pass a resolution against the Iran agreement by 162 to 269 votes on Friday. \n\nDisgrace in the House \nFormer Democratic Senator Mike Gravel \nThe House vote, however, is symbolic that will have no consequence for the implementation of the nuclear agreement, reached between Iran and the P5+1 -- the US, Britain, Russia, China, France, and Germany -- in Vienna in mid-July. \n\n“The fact that the House voted for this, all they have shown is their political opinions, it has no validity in law and it’s a disgrace,” Former Democratic Senator Mike Gravel told Press TV on Saturday. \n\n“It is clearly led by the AIPAC’s influence on the House members and the Congress,” added Gravel, a candidate in the 2008 US presidential election. \n\n'We’ll use every tool' \nJohn Boehner (L) with Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel \nAccording to the Washington-based The Hill newspaper, Republicans in both chambers are now conspiring to launch new attacks to either undermine the accord or force Democrats to cast the same vote all over again. \n\n“This debate is far from over and, frankly, it's just beginning,” House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, vowed this week. \n\n“This is a bad deal with decades-long consequences for the security of the American people and our allies,” he declared. \n\n“And we'll use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented,” added Boehner, who earlier this year even invited the Israeli premier to Washington, DC to speak against the Iran deal. \n\nOne more vote on Tuesday  \nUS Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \nIn the Senate, minutes after Democrats filibustered legislation opposing the agreement, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said senators will vote on the Iran deal one more time on Tuesday. \n\n“We’ll revisit the issue next week, and see if maybe any folks want to change their minds,” the visibly shaken McConnell said on Thursday. \n\nAnd his deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters, “It will be all Iran next week.” \n\n“There are going to be more votes,” he said. “There will be other opportunities for people to change their mind next week, hopefully after they hear from their constituents. \n\nLawsuit threat against Obama \nUS President Barack Obama \nSpeaking with reporters on Thursday, Boehner threatened to sue Obama in order to stop him from finalizing the Iran deal. \n\nHe said during a news conference on Capitol Hill that legal action is “an option that’s very possible.” \n\n“If you read the provisions in [the congressional review law], it’s pretty clear that the president has not complied,” the Republican said. \n\nRepublicans hollow posturing \nGOP Sen. Bob Corker (L) speaks to reporters as Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (2nd L) and Mitch McConnell (R) listen at the US Capitol on September 9, 2015. (AFP photo) \nAnalysts, however, say that Republicans cannot stop the historic Vienna accord now; they are only hollow posturing to gain money from the Israel lobby. \n\nRepublican attempts such as holding a secondary vote or suing Obama are “all just hollow posturing on the part of the Republicans for money from the Israel lobby primarily, but also trying to create some type of issue for the upcoming presidential election,” E. Michael Jones told Press TV on Thursday. \n\nEurope pulled this off  \nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (R), German Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (L), US Secretary of State John Kerry (C) talk prior to their final plenary meeting at the UN building in Vienna, Austria on July 14, 2015. (AFP photo) \nJones, former professor and editor of Culture Wars magazine, also revealed that the European states involved in the nuclear negotiations with Iran warned Congress to approve the agreement or the Europeans would lift sanctions unilaterally. \n\n“The European component to this deal sent a delegation to the United States’ Congress and said ‘if you do this [disapprove of the agreement], we’re leaving, we’re out of here, we’re going to lift the sanctions unilaterally,’” he stated. \n\n“And that carried the day with these people because they know that the United States can’t continue this without them… Republicans know this, they were in on the briefing” he noted.

0347_70584b94-57f1-4c8c-8dd7-6ed2afb83031	Biochemist who became Haiti’s voodoo 'Pope’ and once treated the Clintons to an animal sacrifice, London's Telegraph reports.\n\n\n\n\nMax Beauvoir, who has died aged 79, was a Sorbonne-educated biochemical engineer who, in 2008, became Haiti’s voodoo “Pope” or “Ati” .\n\n\n\n\nVoodoo was introduced to the Americas by West Africans brought to work as slaves on the plantations. Forbidden from practising their native religion in the open, they combined tribal animist traditions with elements of Roman Catholic teaching; the result was a popular religion centred on trances said to be induced by spirit possession and including animal sacrifice, dancing, drum-beating and elements of Christian liturgy.\n\n\n\n\nIn this fusion Christian saints became voodoo spirits. The 400-strong voodoo pantheon includes such figures as Kouzin Zaka (St Isidor) and Papa Lekba (St Lazarus). Perhaps most notoriously (not least because he played a starring role in the James Bond film Live and Let Die), the Peruvian St Martin de Porres was syncretised as Baron Samedi, usually depicted as a corpse dressed in top hat, dinner-jacket and dark glasses; he is known for obscenity, debauchery, and a fondness for tobacco and rum infused with hot peppers.\n\n\n\n\nBeauvoir himself sometimes assumed the spirit of Papa Ogou (St James the Great), one western witness of his performance describing how the spirit “through Beauvoir, downed a bottle of what the celebrants told me was the spirit’s favourite scotch, Johnnie Walker. Then, with his balance intact, Beauvoir resumed dancing.”\n\n\n\n\nVoodoo is practised in parts of South America and the Caribbean, but is most powerful in Haiti. Voodoo houngans (and mambos, their female counterparts) are often the most influential people in Haitian communities, acting as healers, soothsayers, exorcists and counsellors – and in remoter places, even as mayors and notaries.\n\nYet even there, voodoo is controversial, partly because of its connection with the hated regime of Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier, Haiti’s president from 1957 to 1971, and his son and successor Jean-Claude “Baby Doc”. Papa Doc relied on voodoo to bolster support for his regime and recruited houngans for the Tontons Macoutes, his brutal secret police .\n\nBaby Doc had a more strained relationship with voodoo, though shortly before he fled the country in 1986 he summoned Beauvoir and other houngans to advise him about how to respond to rising public anger. Beauvoir claimed that he had accused Duvalier of leading a corrupt administration that ignored voodoo principles of helping the poor .\n\nThat did not prevent Haitian mobs killing more than 100 voodoo priests in the aftermath of Duvalier’s departure. Beauvoir himself became a focus of public hostility when a crowd surrounded his walled estate outside Port au Prince, and hurled rocks and bottles inside, demanding his death.\n\nUnder Baby Doc’s regime Beauvoir had set about turning his home into a visitor attraction where tourists could, for a fee, watch him making offerings to the spirits.\n\nIn his autobiography , the former US president Bill Clinton recalled a visit to Beauvoir’s centre in 1975 at which he and Hillary had been impressed by the sight of a man walking on hot coals and a woman biting the head off a live chicken.\n\nOne American journalist, however, described Beauvoir as having “the oily manner of a man whom you wouldn’t want to leave alone with your money or your child”.\n\nIn the 1990s Beavoir moved to Washington, where he set to work “demystifying” voodoo for Americans. In 2008, when Haiti’s houngans decided to form a national federation, Beauvoir was invited back to assume the newly created position of “Ati” or supreme chief of the religion.\n\nAfter Haiti’s devastating earthquake of January 2010, Beauvoir urged his network of houngans to help with the recovery effort. But in December the same year he appealed to the authorities to intervene to stop the lynchings of voodoo priests by people who blamed them for causing an outbreak of cholera by scattering powder or casting “spells”.\n\nThe son of a doctor and grandson of a houngan, Max Gesner Beauvoir was born in Haiti on August 25 1936 and graduated in 1958 from City College of New York with a degree in Chemistry. In 1962 he took another degree, in Biochemistry, at the Sorbonne, after which he became a research scientist in the US.\n\nHe returned to Haiti in the early 1970s to conduct experiments on traditional herbal remedies but shortly after his arrival he was summoned to join other family members at the bedside of his dying grandfather. “Grandfather turned to me and said, 'You will carry on the tradition.’ It was not the sort of thing you could refuse.”\n\nAbandoning his scientific career for voodoo , in 1974 Beauvoir founded Le Péristyle de Mariani, a voodoo temple in his home, and established himself as the public face of the religion.\n\nAlthough he was unapologetic about such practices as animal sacrifice, he rejected the “Hollywood version of voodoo”. By his account voodoo was not a cause but a solution to Haiti’s problems and he called for the country’s houngans to be given a formal role in government.\n\n“We are the country,” he proclaimed. “Many people do not want to see it that way.”\n\nMax Beauvoir and his wife Elizabeth had two daughters.\n\nMax Beauvoir, born August 25 1936, died September 12 2015\n\n\n\n\n For the original report go to http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11866992/Max-Beauvoir-voodoo-chief-obituary.html
0348_4da77f3a-633a-46bf-b1e2-027e2e59bfd0	Michel were built with a 21-yard hurrying touchdown within the first half to push Georgia to some 17-3 lead and produce the very first hint of the fly out brewing. His second touchdown of the overall game would be a sign the rout was on. \n \nJohn Theus almost cited Mitchell verbatim. \n \n“He’s capable of getting out into open space and bruise you over,” Nick Chubb stated. “I’ve seen him do this a few occasions, use that shoulder to get involved with the endzone. He did a fantastic job tonight.” \n \nThe new sony Michel was requested how he performed against Sc. \n \nIn some way, following the sophomore running back obtained three touchdowns within the Bulldogs 52-20 conquer Sc, Michel was mellow. \n \n“Once the ball will get into my hands, it’s just comes lower to creating plays,” Michel stated. “We got to win individuals one-on-ones.” \n \nMichel has five touchdowns around the season, probably the most around the team. \n \n\n \nMichel’s third touchdown wasn’t as overpowering, however it still put his athleticism displayed. Michel caught a brief spread the best side from the area and juked around another Sc defender. Rather than plowing a Gamecock defender in to the ground, he pulled two defenders in to the finish zone. \n \nHe stated he performed OK. \n      \n“I’m proud. I’m happy for him,” senior wideout Malcolm Mitchell stated. “Sony will do it all. He is able to juke, cost you over. Beat you with speed and run routes. He’s an excellent player.” \n \n“Sony is dynamic. He is able to fall into line anywhere and execute,” Theus stated. “That is the reason why him special. Anytime he will get the ball in the hands, he is able to score.” \n \nWhen reminiscing around the play, Michel felt as though he’d a situation of deja-vu. \n \nOn Michel’s 11 touches he accumulated 87 yards and individuals three scores. He effectively ended any hope of Sc mounting a comeback as he obtained Georgia’s first couple of touchdowns from the other half within the identical way — turning a brief pass into an 11-yard touchdown catch. \n \n“I’m type of difficult on myself, so I only say there’s lots of room for improvement,” Michel stated. “I got the great job from coach, but we still got more games to experience.Inches \n \nMichel doesn’t think about themself for the reason that manner. He didn’t wish to discuss his destruction from the Sc defense, or his numerous touchdowns. \n \nWhenever you request other gamers to explain Michel and the game, every one has exactly the same reaction. They smile or chuckle before offering out how gifted he’s. They call him up special and gifted. Mark Richt stated he’s Georgia’s best player in many facets. \n \nMichel required a brief dump spread the left side from the area and located themself one-on-one having a Sc defender. He juked inside making your opponent miss. He barreled toward the goaline going to a different one-on-one situation. This time around he decreased his shoulder and pressed your opponent in to the endzone. \n \n“It was similar to exactly the same scenario,” Michel stated. “You get a different one-on-one, you gotta win individuals.” \n \nThe post appeared first on News List Online .
0349_dbcb0d35-7ece-4f31-b675-9b876306fef8	W hile Hillary Clinton’s team of consultants is locked in a room somewhere trying to figure out how she can project authenticity, Joe Biden is out doing it.   \n \nThe vice president’s interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert  last week was compellingly human, as Biden talked of the tragic loss of his son Beau and his decision whether or not to make a late entry into the Democratic presidential race.  \n \nIt’s rare for someone who has been at the pinnacle of our politics for decades to get a second look. But Biden’s latest family tragedy (he lost his first wife and a daughter to a car accident in the 1970s) means that the vice president is viewed through a prism of sympathy, as a grieving father rather than just another politician. And Hillary’s struggles, especially her woodenness, put an accent on Biden’s let-it-all-hang-out, true-to-his-self personality.  \n \nYou can disagree with Biden, you can mock him, you can cringe at his miscues — but it is impossible not to like him. Hillary’s team can come up with the best, most elaborate plan for her latest makeover (it will emphasize spontaneity, the New York Times reports) and still not come close to matching the bizarre charm of Biden being Biden.  \n \nWe are constantly assured by people around her that Hillary Clinton is “warm in private.” Biden is warm in public. His performance swearing in new senators earlier this year was a nonstop Bidenesque spectacle of selfies, folksy comments, and general crazy-uncle antics, some of dubious appropriateness.  \n You can disagree with Biden, you can mock him…but it is impossible not to like him.  \nThe public personas of Hillary and Biden are captured in the story of two parades. One of the enduring moments of the Hillary campaign so far is reporters being corralled in a roped-off pen to keep them away from the candidate during a small July Fourth parade in New Hampshire — creating an instant metaphor for arrogance and control.  \n \nWhen Joe Biden showed up at a Pittsburgh Labor Day parade, he broke into a trot, eagerly bouncing from one side of the route to another, shaking hands, dispensing hugs, and kissing babies. Low energy, in Donald Trump’s signature phrase, this was not. Biden was a joyous retail campaigner in his element. \n \nOf course, there is a reason he has run for president twice before unsuccessfully. He blew up his 1988 presidential campaign by stealing the words of British labor leader Neil Kinnock to describe his own life, and kneecapped his 2008 campaign with an insulting description of Barack Obama right out of the gate. But in the age of Trump, “gaffe-prone” doesn’t look like quite the negative it used to be. \n \nBiden is no Trump, but he lacks subtlety and has no filter. If these qualities hurt him in the past, they may serve him better when the public is sick of the typical sound-bite politics.  \n \nOn paper, Biden is hardly a natural match for the populist, anti-establishment mood. He first got elected to the Senate in 1972, a year after Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was born. Biden was running on his experience during his first presidential bid, almost 30 years ago. His resume includes 17 years as chairman or ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and 12 as chairman or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This is a resume for a gold watch, not for a late-developing, insurgent presidential campaign. \n \nYet Biden is a practiced and, unfortunately, fairly effective demagogue. He can denounce the rich with the best of them.  \n \nIf he gets in, he will immediately be evaluated by a different standard. He’ll be an actual candidate rather than the intriguing potential new entry. He’ll be the old white guy trying to “stop history.” But he’ll also be a breath of fresh air in a Democratic race that was supposed to be the stultifying march to the nomination by one of the dullest politicians of our time. \n \n— Rich Lowry is the editor of National Review .

0350_031dcadc-4d78-48ec-b82e-05cbf20a8f57	State Rep. Holly Raschein. Photo courtesy Florida Fish and Wildlife .  \nRepublicans have a problem: They are often presumed to be bigots. \n \nPart of the problem is one of their own making. While many of the candidates in the GOP presidential field have staked slightly more nuanced positions, all of them have still said they believe marriage should be restricted to one man and one woman. Socially liberal Republicans ( who do, in fact, exist ) have often been drowned out in the past by those who refuse to acknowledge or accept this century’s broader view of what equal protection under the law means in daily life. \n \nBut another part of the problem is that in many corners of the media and in the public mind, the very term Republican almost means “intolerant,” to the point that it is considered newsworthy when a member of the GOP behaves contrary to the stereotype. \n \nHats off to Florida state Rep. Holly Raschein for doing something to change that, by promoting legislation to provide legal protections to gay and transgender Floridians. \n \nFlorida is one of 28 states that do not currently offer workers legal protection against employment discrimination based on their sexual orientation, and is among the 31 that do not offer such protection based on gender identity. (A few of these states do extend protection to job candidates or employees for state employment only.) Local ordinances cover 10 counties and 22 municipalities in Florida, representing about half of the state’s population, but 57 of the state’s counties still offer no such protection. \n \nRaschein, a Republican who represents Monroe County in the state legislature, is co-sponsoring a bill for the 2016 legislative session to extend protections throughout the state. The proposal, called the Florida Competitive Workforce Act , would add sexual orientation and gender identity or expression to the list of protected classes covered under Florida’s employment discrimination law. \n \nSpeaking to the Miami Herald, Raschein emphasized that there was no conflict between her political identity and her choice to champion this legislation. “I can be just as conservative as I want to be and still believe in eliminating discrimination of LGBT people,” she said. She added that her identities as a conservative, a Baptist and a mother had absolutely no bearing on “doing the right thing.” \n \nI am a Republican, and I wouldn’t mind having my business endorse the proposed Florida legislation, if anyone happened to ask us. At this point it’s hard to imagine why anyone would reject a job candidate because that individual is, or seems to be, gay, bisexual or transgender, unless those traits had some relationship to the actual job. (The Florida bill, like most similar statutes in other states, includes an exception for bona fide occupational requirements. We still won’t get any Jewish priests in Catholic churches and, for the foreseeable future, no openly gay ones either.) \n \nThat scenario is hard to picture, but still not impossible. It wasn’t so long ago that we were fighting over whether gay servicemen and women could openly serve in the U.S. armed forces without jeopardizing the security of the nation. And it has taken us until now to even begin the process of lifting the ban on transgender personnel . The type of thinking that created and supported such bans may be less common and less open these days, but it has not gone away entirely. Even though same-sex marriage is now the law of the land, 39 percent of Americans still say they oppose it. \n \nBut given the strong correlation between support for LGBT rights and age, it seems inevitable that, sooner than later, the opponents of LGBT civil rights will be as reluctant to openly admit their position  as the rare opponent of interracial marriage or women in the military today. \n \nWhy should someone have to conceal his or her sexual orientation or gender to get a job as an accountant or to rent an apartment? There is no logical reason, and our laws should reflect as much. \n \nConservative or liberal, Republican or Democrat, we answered these questions with respect to race and religion a long time ago. We are finally getting around to it with respect to a person’s private sexuality and public identity. If the holdouts who think civil rights protections are a bad thing want to flock to Republican primaries, we can’t stop them, but we certainly should not give them more than their due. Candidates shouldn’t either. \n \nIt is still a problem for Republicans that the Miami Herald considers it particularly relevant that the sponsor of the Florida bill is a conservative, Republican, straight, Baptist mom. But that surprise will inevitably be temporary. When enough other Republicans follow her lead, the stereotype will fall away.

Customer Match allows you to upload a list of email addresses, which can be matched to signed-in users on Google in a secure and privacy-safe way. From there, you can build campaigns and ads specifically designed to reach your audience.  Google can help you reach customers that you already have a relationship with -- like those in your loyalty program or who have made a previous purchase -- in ways that are most relevant to their intent and context.” \n  \nFor those of you at all familiar with online advertising, you’ll recognize the striking similarities that Customer Match has to Facebook’s Custom Audience tool. \n \nHere’s how Facebook describes Custom Audiences: \n  \n”Custom Audiences let you reach customers you already know with ads on Facebook. You can upload a list of email addresses or phone numbers of at least 20 people and we'll deliver your ad to those people if they're on Facebook.” \n  \nSo let’s break down the similarities between the two, where each tool has its strengths, and how you can use both to boost your online advertising ROI. \n The Similarities Between Google Customer Match and Facebook Custom Audience:  \nThey’re both allowing your business to target existing leads or customers specifically, allowing you to nurture leads into sales or sales into loyal customers off your website. \n \nTo be totally frank, Google’s newest advertising release is directly in answer to Facebook’s own tool, and I’m surprised it took them this long to do it (custom audience has been available to all advertisers since October of 2013). \n Where Google has the Advantage:  \nGoogle’s Customer Match gives you access to a wider breadth of internet in which to reach your leads and previous clients, from Gmail to Search to YouTube. \n \nFacebook can’t quite compete with that. \n \nHere are the numbers:  72% percent of adults online visit Facebook at least once a month. (Source: 41 Up-to-Date Facebook Stats and Facts ). \n \nHowever, about 93% of adults use online search, and 67% of those use Google to do it. And that doesn’t even include YouTube usage or Gmail. (Source: netmarketshare.com and marketingprofs.com ). \n \nThat’s pretty significant. Google has four advertising platforms: search, display, email and YouTube. That means you can reach your customers and leads wherever they are throughout the day. \n \nAlso, Google has “intent-based advertising,” where Facebook doesn’t. That is, unless you count Facebook’s website custom audiences, which I don’t (feel free to argue in the comment section below). \n \nHere’s how Google describes the true strength of their new tool: \n  \n”Let's say you’re a travel brand. You can now reach people who have joined your rewards program as they plan their next trip. For example, when these rewards members search for “non-stop flights to new york” on Google.com, you can show relevant ads at the top of their search results on any device right when they’re looking to fly to New York. And when those members are watching their favorite videos on YouTube or catching up on Gmail, you can show ads that inspire them to plan their next trip.” \n  \nAnd that’s the key... Your brand can now show advertisements to previous clients based on what they’re actually looking for.  \n \nThat’s where Facebook has always fallen down (and why their click-through-rates are so much lower than a Google search ad). True, with website custom audiences you can show a Facebook ad to people who have visited your site (and this gets close) but Google answers that with their far more powerful remarketing platform . \n Where Facebook has the Advantage:  \nGoogle is also offering a “Similar Audiences” tool, which allows you to “reach new customers [...] who [...] have similar interests and characteristics to your rewards members.” \n \nYep, that’s exactly like Facebook’s lookalike audiences tool.  \n \nFacebook’s lookalike audience tool has been out for about two years now and, as Facebook describes it… \n  \n“ [Is] a way to reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they're similar to customers you care about. When you use Custom Audiences, you can choose to create a Lookalike Audience that targets people who are similar to one of your Custom Audience lists. ” \n  \nSo the tools are, on the face of them, the same. However, Facebook’s a social media platform, with unparalleled access to the details of its users. \n \nIn other words, Facebook’s lookalike audiences are going to have far more in common with your custom audience than Google’s are. \n \nTrue, Google has access to your browser cookies (if you’re on Chrome), search history and even the details of your Gmail conversations, but they can’t see your age, relationship status, family history, purchases you’ve made, cars you’ve owned or the fact that you are planning a trip to Brazil in December before you’ve even searched for flights (like Facebook can). \n How is this different from Google remarketing or Facebook website custom audience?  \nGreat question, because on the face of it, it’s tough to see the difference. Both Google Customer Match and remarketing strategies (like Facebook WCAs) allow you to reach your lead or customer after they’ve behaved in a certain way, and both allow you to do it off-site. \n \nThe difference lies in specificity. Currently remarketing and WCAs work based on a person’s visit to a specific URL within your website. So you know they have a vague interest in that page (pricing, for instance). But Customer Match has the added power of enabling you to target your leads based on exactly what they’re searching for on Google. \n \nImagine remarketing a lead based on their downloading of your landing page ebook and their search for “most-affordable landing page builder for small businesses.” \n \nThat’s pretty damn specific, and that’s what Google’s Customer Match allows you to do. \n How to Create a Customer Match Audience & Custom Audience:  \n\n For more, check out our awesome infographic on Facebook Ads vs Google Adwords:  \n\n \nReady to start sending your ad traffic to optimized landing pages?

Upload the same email list to Facebook as you do to Google and take the design elements from your Facebook Ad and put them in a Google Display ad (same message too). Carpet the internet, from Facebook to Youtube and every Google search or email in between. \n \nBoth platforms offer fantastic analytics. Both offer strengths the other doesn’t. \n \nAnd neither contractually obliges you to be faithful, so spread your advertising oats! \n \nAnd please tell me when you start seeing Customer Match within your ad tool (should be in the next couple weeks in the US). \n \nWhat are you thoughts about Google’s new ads tool?

0352_360229e6-6f85-412a-a835-4f4bc1994603	Saint Benedict CenterI thought that this article should be posted in the column section because it is that important. It is a rare married couple that does not argue and argue often. However, when an argument turns into an angry exchange, there is damage done to the heart, which often needs a supernatural remedy to heal the wound. That is confession and a firm purpose of amendment. There is also a need for restitution. If you have stolen money from another it is common sense that one must pay back what one has stolen. But do we make restitution when we rob a person of the love they need by inflicting pain instead? We must dry the tears that we have caused to be shed, be they visible or invisible. We must say, “I am sorry” for whatever it is that we have said in anger. Or not said, when a thank you was in order. Anger can be expressed by a fuming silence just as effectively as harsh words. The “I do” of a marriage contract means that we commit to making our spouse happy, not just secure, or, in the case of the husband, well-fed. “Love of my life, I want to make you happy.” Let spouses help each other to do that. Let anger not enter the door. It’s a killer. Kate Veik, CNA: Of the countless Catholic couples who have come through Father T.G. Morrow’s office in Washington D.C. for marriage counseling, two remain imprinted in the priest’s mind even today. In many ways, these two Catholic couples were the ideal; they were open to life, they formed their children in the faith and they frequented the sacraments. But both of these marriages fell apart. The culprit? Anger. Read more here. Share, Bookmark, Like: Facebook, Twitter, etc.
0353_acdb6993-5994-456d-bee4-7c6937f0e281	CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES:  Starbucks Corp can move to Cuba, but it still cannot sell lattes there. The Obama administration on Friday tore down barriers to US companies doing business on the Communist-ruled island just south of Miami, but plenty of regulatory and legal roadblocks remain on both sides of the Florida Straits. Airlines and cruise ships will see less meddling with their schedules, although the new rules approved by President Barack Obama will not lead to a significant boost in visitors, as US law still prohibits most Americans from travelling there. But Starbucks can still not sell prepared drinks like a latte or a cappuccino, only packaged coffee, said John Kavulich, President of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc. \nThe new rules of engagement have opened the door for Internet companies, but a Cuba government-owned company has the local monopoly on Web services. \nThe prospects for retailers and restaurants are murky. \nCuba’s mostly poor population of 11 million has limited spending power and remaining US law tightly restricts what can be sold to the former Cold War foe. \nAnd then there is the biggest wild card of all: the Cuban government, which will have the final say on who is licensed to do what. “You don’t just go down to Cuba and hang up your shingles. \nThat’s not how it operates,” said Kirby Jones, head of Alamar Associates, which has advised companies on business in Cuba since the 1970s. Starbucks, for one, said it had no plans to enter Cuba. \nTo be sure, executives described the relaxing of US rules as an important step toward opening up the Cuban economy to US investment in a wide range of industries. \nUnited Parcel Service Inc said it “welcomes the opportunity to provide logistics services in and out of Cuba as regulations are changed”. A spokeswoman for Archer Daniels Midland Co, which has exported goods to Cuba under existing regulations, said the agribusiness group “will be ready to adapt to new opportunities as they arise.” \nUS telecoms Verizon Communications Inc and Sprint Corp on Thursday and Friday said they planned to offer cell phone roaming in Cuba. But other companies showed a more cautious tone. Both Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s biggest retailer, and home improvement chain Home Depot Inc, said they were focused on growing in their existing markets. \nKurt Jetta, head of the TABS Group, which provides consulting for some of the top consumer and retail firms, said: “we have over 50 clients, and no one is talking about Cuba.” \nWhile the new regulations would allow US companies to open retail outlets, there are limits on what can be sold based on US trade law enacted in 2000. It is these restrictions, along with uncertainty over what the Cuba government will allow, that should keep US executives cautious about the potential for business in Cuba. The new rules started a process that would take time, he added. “Obama took a sledgehammer to US regulations today, but he’s 50 per cent  of the equation,” said Kavulich of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.”No one should be fuelling up their corporate jet and filing a flight plan for Havana today.” \nThe new rules do not allow US companies to extend credit to Cuba, nor do they permit Cuba to use dollars in international transactions. Even if such rules were eased, non-US companies that do business in Cuba right now are working with credit terms of anywhere from nine months to two years, said Gary Heathcott, a special consultant to CJRW, an advertising and public relations firm in Arkansas, who soon will be travelling to Cuba with Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and representatives from businesses such as farmer-owned cooperative Riceland Foods. \n“They are a cash-poor country,” Heathcott said. Just getting there remains a hurdle, with a prohibition on regular scheduled flights still in place. \nThe new regulations allow US airlines to set up local offices, and to hire Cuban nationals as gate agents, airline sources said. Some former Cuban companies want a lot more. \nOn the heels of the 1959 revolution, communist leader Fidel Castro’s government seized privately owned homes and businesses and nationalized all foreign businesses with little in the way of compensation or restitution for Americans. \nBacardi, the largest privately held spirits maker in the world, was among the most successful companies in Cuba before its Cuban assets were seized by the government and its founders exiled in the 1960s. \nIn a statement, the company said it was too early to comment about a possible return to the island nation. \n“We believe that the issue of properties expropriated from US citizens and Cuban Americans will need to addressed,” a Bacardi spokeswoman said in a emailed statement. — Reuters
0354_33baf6fb-a013-4921-a4d6-927c77a8d621	 Southeast Lower Peninsula\n Southwest Lower Peninsula\n Northeast Lower Peninsula\n Northwest Lower Peninsula\n Upper Peninsula  Great Lakes Temperature Map The fall trout and salmon runs are off to a slow start.  The fish move in with the rain and cooler temperatures but then some are turning around and heading back out to the big lake when it warms back up.  Lake trout and splake fishing on Lake Huron will close on September 30.  Lake trout season in the northern section of Lake Michigan down to Frankfort will also close on September 30.  Southeast Lower Peninsula Lake Erie:  Had heavy yellow perch fishing especially out of Brest Bay, off Stony Point, Fermi, and Toledo Beach.  Those that caught fish were using minnows on spreaders while anchored in 20 to 25 feet.  Fish were also caught around the E-Buoy, and the C-Buoy as well as Buoys 1 & 2 at the mouth of the Raisin River.  No walleye to report this week.    Lenawee County:  Bluegill anglers fishing Devils Lake reported slow catch rates.  Those that did catch some say the fish were suspended in 20 to 30 feet and were hitting on wax worms and crickets.  Crappie fishing was starting to pick up for those using minnows.  For Lake Hudson, anglers were putting in more time looking for muskie with the cooler water temperatures.  Bass anglers were starting to do better especially in shallow waters.  Detroit River:  Boat anglers are targeting walleye, bass, muskie, channel catfish and yellow perch.  Walleye anglers are bottom bouncing with crawler harnesses, hand-lining or jigging.  Those hand-lining at night did catch a few fish.  Fishing slowed around Mud Island and Grassy Island.  Success rates downriver were variable at the mouth and up along the east side of Grosse Ile.  Those fishing around Celeron Island averaged zero to two walleye though a few limit or near limit catches were reported.  Most of the fish were 16 to 18 inches but a few were up to 25.  Catch rates were fair for large and smallmouth bass but many were sub-legal.  Anglers are casting and drop-shotting along the east side of Grosse Ile and around the smaller islands.  Yellow perch anglers were getting a few more keepers.  The better fishing was near Hennepin Point and Sugar Island.  Catch rates should pick up as minnows become more plentiful.  Muskie anglers reported light action with a few fish in the 30 inch range.  Water temperatures were 68 to 70 degrees. Lake St. Clair:  Smallmouth bass fishing remains very good. Water temperatures are starting to drop and anglers should see bass to begin moving into shallower waters again. Perch fishing continues to be slow with anglers reporting lots of small fish, but few finding any number of keeper size.  Walleye fishing has been slow but should improve as the fall migration from Lake Huron to Lake Erie gets underway. St. Clair River:  Walleye fishing remains slow with only a few fish caught in the upper river near the Bluewater Bridge.  As temperatures cool, fishing should improve as walleye that have been roaming Lake Huron begin to filter south into the St. Clair River on their way back to Lake Erie. Sturgeon fishing has been steady with some large fish in the mix.  Those looking for sturgeon should focus on the Delta Channels. Sturgeon anglers have also been catching some nice catfish. Lexington & Port Sanilac:  A few lake trout and steelhead were caught in 60 to 70 feet.  Pier anglers managed the occasional bass or pike.  Harbor Beach:  Had rumors of walleye taken at night by those fishing off the breakwall.  Some lake trout were caught north of the harbor in 100 to 120 feet.  Try dodgers with spin-n-glows right on the bottom or spoons off downriggers.  Digging the bottom with dodgers worked best.  For steelhead, try fishing near the color line with bright colored spoons.  A few perch were caught inside the harbor.  They are small but will entertain the kids.    Port Austin:  Produced a nice limit of lake trout for one boat trolling straight north of the lighthouse and using spin-n-glows in 130 feet.  Saginaw Bay:  Run-off from the last heavy rain did murk up the water near the mouth of the rivers which put a damper on fishing success.  Some boats were out fishing the dead shipping channel in the early morning most likely for perch.   Back to Top Southwest Lower Peninsula St. Joseph:  A few salmon were caught from the piers by those casting spoons.  Fishing was not great but it was consistent.  Perch fishing was slow.   St. Joseph River:  Had steelhead and a light number of salmon.  Try spawn.     South Haven:  Pier fishing for salmon was slow but a couple were caught by those floating shrimp under a bobber.  Fishing was slow for boat anglers targeting salmon.  The few caught were taken on spoons in 110 feet.     Kalamazoo River:  Had a few Chinook and coho.  Try fishing the deeper holes during the day.  For those fishing early or late, try spawn or anything that glows.   Grand Haven:  Boats trolling in front of the piers caught coho and a few Chinook on glow plugs and orange spoons.  Pier anglers caught a couple coho on spawn and alewife or when casting glow spoons.     Grand River at Grand Rapids:  Had a nice run of coho, Chinook and steelhead that made it up to the 6th Street Dam.  They were caught on spawn, flies and yarn.  Channel and flathead catfish along with some suckers were also caught by those targeting salmon and those fishing off the wall with live bait.   Grand River at Lansing:  Had a few coho caught near the Lyons Dam and the Webber Dam.  The bite was best in the very early morning.  Try spawn or spinners.  Smallmouth bass were hitting on tube baits.       Muskegon:  Those trolling around and near the piers are finding a few Chinook salmon.  Glow plugs worked best.  Those heading out further found trout and salmon 40 to 100 feet down in 150 to 250 feet with orange or green spoons and green meat rigs.  Pier anglers casting for salmon did not have much luck.    Muskegon River:  Has a few salmon and steelhead being caught in the lower stretches.  Target the deeper holes until conditions change.  Bass anglers are doing well for smallmouth.   Whitehall:  The mature salmon are pretty much spread out between the big lake, White Lake and the river.  The bite was slow but those trolling in 50 to 70 feet did manage to catch a few.  No fish were caught by pier anglers.   White Lake:  Boat anglers caught a few salmon when casting green, orange and yellow double jointed body baits.  Back to Top Northeast Lower Peninsula Rogers City:  The fish were scattered so look for baitfish and structure.  Lake trout and splake season is still open through September 30.  A few salmon were caught along the inner section of Swan Bay by those trolling bombers from boards.  Those fishing in waters up to 70 feet deep in front of Swan Bay had limited success with adult salmon but did catch younger salmon, steelhead, lake trout and the occasional Atlantic or walleye.  They are using an assortment of spoons and J-Plugs or attractors with flies, squid or cut bait.  Best colors were green, blue, black and white, orange, white or glow early and late.  Forty Mile Point should be a good bet for younger salmon, steelhead and lake trout especially as we move towards the end of the month.  There has been a lot of young smelt in the area so imitate them with smaller lures.   Alpena:  Anglers are pretty much targeting anything from salmon to walleye. The better action was straight out from the harbor in 40 to 70 feet or try North Point and around Thunder Bay Island.  The “Humps” were good for lake trout weather permitting.  The salmon and trout were hitting on spoons fished throughout the water column.  Steelhead were hitting up high on orange spoons with between 1 and 5 colors of lead core.  Lake trout are near the bottom but some were suspended.  Walleye were hitting on deep diving crank baits and reef runners.     Thunder Bay River:  Had rumors of a few salmon caught very late at night otherwise it has been slow because the water is still too warm.  A few smallmouth were caught but none were keepers.  There appears to be many species in the river but they are small in size.   Harrisville:  Salmon were coming in but no big numbers yet.  Those still-fishing in the harbor with spawn under a bobber or casting spoons and body baits did manage to catch a few fish.  Boat anglers heading north and targeting walleye did catch some fish on body baits in the early morning or late evening.     Oscoda:  Pier fishing was slow with only a few salmon caught.  Boat anglers were trolling the mouth of the river and north of the bay.  Most were staying in 12 to 30 feet and using spoons, wobble glows, peanuts or body baits.    Au Sable River:  Had very few salmon.  As with the steelhead this spring the salmon run may be running late. Houghton Lake:  Those targeting walleye picked up a few small fish when trolling or drifting crawler harnesses.  They were also hooking into some good size bass at the same time.  A fair to good number of pike were also caught. Lake St. Helen:  Had good bass fishing for those using surface baits.  Bluegills, pumpkinseed and rock bass were hitting on leaf worms, wax worms and crawlers.  Try minnows for crappie.   Tawas River:  The occasional Chinook salmon was caught in the lower river.   Au Gres:  Boat anglers reported slow fishing.  Those launching from Eagle Bay Marina which is at the end of Sagatoo Road did fair for perch with most fish caught off the Saganing Bar or the Pinconning Bar in 10 to 40 feet.  The fish averaged 7 to 10 inches.  There were rumors of a decent number of perch caught by shore anglers in the lower Pine River but lots of sorting was necessary.   Au Gres River:  Was producing a few catfish and small perch.  On the East Branch, there was no activity at the Singing Bridge.  Back to Top Northwest Lower Peninsula Petoskey:  Lake trout were caught 115 to 130 feet down in front of the harbor.  There has been a lot more angler pressure on the shore and piers.  A few salmon were caught off the clock dock and the breakwall in the early morning by those casting crank baits.  A couple fish were also taken when surfcasting near the breakwall.  Bear River:  Water levels were high again after the weekend rain and a lot of fish ran during that time period however the fish seem to move in and then return back to the big water very quickly this year.  Those fishing did catch a few small steelhead and brown trout when using spawn or artificial baits.  Charlevoix:  Lake trout were caught 100 to 150 feet down on flies and spoons.  Some fish were marked about 100 feet down at North Point.  The water temperature is constant from the surface to 100 feet down.  A few boats caught the odd salmon when casting near shore by the cement plant, mainly after dark but anglers are working hard to get them.  The Medusa Creek weir is in operation so the creek is closed to fishing within 100 feet of the mouth.  Those targeting salmon by wading out and casting into the slip reported slow catch rates.  Most were using stick baits.  Some bigger smallmouth were caught in the channel but anglers had to put in their time.  Use worms, leeches or soft plastics on the bottom.   Elk River:  Fishing has been relatively slow with the occasional coho, brown trout, or Chinook caught below the dam when using spawn.    Traverse City:  The East Bay had good lake trout and cisco fishing in 80 to110 feet. Most of the lake trout were near the bottom and the cisco were 50 to 75 feet down.  A few anglers are getting perch.  The smallmouth bass and the salmon fishing were slow.  In the West Bay, the lake trout and cisco action was fair in 80 to 100 feet.  Those trolling for salmon were near the mouth of the Boardman.  They are marking fish on their electronics but very few were caught.  Perch were taken in 30 to 40 feet. Boardman River:  Coho and Chinook salmon are showing up in the weir.  Fishing has been slow with fewer anglers and fewer fish than average.  Most are using spawn, crank baits, or fly patterns like an egg-sucking leech.  Anglers did find brook trout and brown trout below Two Forks and some were caught on worms.  Up at the Union Street Dam, anglers using skein caught younger coho.  Those fishing 300 feet below the weir caught coho, Chinook and steelhead on spawn.  Some Chinook salmon were stacked up at the mouth.  Platte River:  Is producing a few salmon up near the lower weir.  Try spawn or egg flies.  The river is closed to fishing within 300 feet of the weir.  Frankfort:  Fresh Chinook salmon were entering Betsie Bay and a small number were moving up into the river.  Those jigging and trolling had some luck in the early morning hours and caught Chinook, coho and steelhead 30 to 50 feet down in 100 to 120 feet.  Green J-plugs were the ticket.  Manistee:  Fishing off the pier and in the channel has been extremely slow.  Those fishing out on the Shelf did manage to catch a small mix of Chinook and steelhead when trolling spoons and J-plugs.  Surface water temperatures were in the mid 60’s.  No word on the thermocline but most are fishing 40 to 60 feet down beyond the pier.  Manistee River:  Has salmon but the warm water temperatures are not helping.  Try early morning when floating spawn or artificial eggs.  During the day, fish the deeper holes.  Ludington:  Fishing in the channel was slow but anglers are picking up a fish here and there when using orange and yellow spoons or body baits.  Pier fishing was also extremely slow.  Boat anglers were lucky to catch a fish when heading out beyond the pier.  Pere Marquette River:  Has salmon but anglers are still waiting for the big push.  Fish were caught by those drifting spawn or casting small spinners or spoons.      Pentwater:  The mature fish are spread between the big lake and the river.  The bite is slow for the most part no matter where you are.  There are essentially no fish coming in from the piers.  Boat anglers have caught mature fish in 50 to 60 feet.  A small number of boats did very well 50 to 60 feet down in 125 feet off Little Sable Point.  They had near limit catches of steelhead and salmon.  The better catches came on green flies and green flashers.    Back to Top Upper Peninsula Lake Gogebic:  Had a lot of anglers but few were finding fish.  Walleye were still the number one target however a small number of yellow perch and smallmouth bass have been caught as well.  Those doing the best were drifting or trolling with crawler harnesses or jigs tipped with a crawler.  The walleye and smallmouth were scattered all over the lake while perch were caught on the north end.   Menominee River:  Jigging was producing some very nice smallmouth and some catfish for those fishing around structure.  Trolling stick baits especially in the evenings has been very productive for walleye.  Shore anglers are catching a mixed bag of fish using crappie rigs tipped with live bait.  A few brown trout and Chinook salmon are starting to show up near the mouth and were hitting on spoons.   Little Bay De Noc:  Walleye anglers reported fair catches trolling or drifting crawler harnesses in 10 to 35 feet from the Second Reef to the “Narrows” and in 20 feet near the “Black Bottom”.  Several nice catches of jumbo perch were taken off the green buoy near the Day’s River and over to the East Bank.  Use minnows in 10 to 18 feet.  Northern pike were active with catches reported throughout the Bay.  Salmon anglers have been checking the rivers but not seeing much yet.   Big Bay De Noc:  Bass anglers have started looking for fish migrating south off Garden Bluff in the deeper water but good catches were still reported in shallow water six to 12 feet.  Some are using minnows with slip bobbers while others are using pumpkin colored plastics.   Marquette:  Shore anglers are getting ready for salmon runs in the Chocolay River.  A few coho were caught.  Pike and bass were caught on the east side of the ore dock near the Carp River.  No reports yet for the Dead River or the Carp River. Au Train Lake:  Had no reports on walleye or keeper size perch.  The smallmouth bass fishing is good using either natural or artificial baits along the west side of the lake and up near the mouth of the Au Train River.   Munising:  Re-construction of the Anna River dock is to begin this week so fishing will be limited to shoreline areas until the construction is completed.  Shore anglers reported slow action with only a few undersize splake caught off the pier.  There has been some activity at Bay Furnace with one small coho caught on a Cleo.  Surface water temperatures were in the mid to upper 50’s.   Grand Marais:  A coho was caught near the lighthouse when casting a Cleo.  Shore anglers on the Sucker River reported slow fishing with only a couple coho and a small rainbow caught.  Try orange or orange and gold spoons.     DeTour:  Water temperature at the lighthouse was 55 degrees at 25 feet down.  A few coho and lake trout were caught on white flashers with green and white spin-n-glows 80 feet down in 100 feet between the green buoy and the lighthouse.  On the north side of DeTour Village, a few yellow perch were caught in 10 to 18 feet off the old dock pilings when using spreaders with shiner minnows.   Drummond Island:  Those targeting yellow perch should focus their attention inside Harbor Island when using shiner minnows and worms just off the weed beds in six to eight feet in the mid-morning hours.  Walleye were good in Maxton Bay when trolling crawler harnesses or stick baits from the south side of James Island to the Sportsmen’s Club in late afternoon.  Good smallmouth action for those jigging brown and green tube jigs in eight to 15 feet off Bruce Point which is on the northeast side of Scott Bay.   Cedarville & Hessel:  Pike fishing has slowed but some fish were still being caught off the pier in the Hessel Marina.  Perch fishing is good in Musky Bay, the east end of Cedarville Bay, and the east end of Hessel Bay going into Snows Channel.  Splake season will close on September 30.  Try the Hessel Marina for one last push of fish.    St. Ignace:  Is slow with only the odd steelhead spotted.  The Carp River is beginning to see a few pink salmon at the mouth and up to Mackinac Trail.  A couple steelhead were harvested at Mackinac Trail.

0355_06f0fe38-ba8d-4a8c-bdcc-109871b564f0	Beijing: An online advertisement urging people not to sell their kidneys but instead donate sperm to win the latest iPhone 6s has gone viral in China, media reported. \n \n“No need to sell a kidney… Shanghai sperm bank can make your iPhone 6s dream come true,” said the advertisement which has gone viral on social networking app WeChat this week, reported Global Post. \n \nThose who qualify to donate can receive up to 6,000 yuan. The latest Apple model is expected to cost around 5,288 yuan, the report said. \n \n“Why sell your kidney when you can donate sperm? It’s a great deed that can bring happiness to a whole family,” said microblog Weibo user “Wojiushiwutong”. \n \nA sperm bank in central China’s Hubei Province posted a similar advertisement highlighting a picture of the new rose gold iPhone 6s, a colour created mainly to attract Chinese consumers. \n \n“I don’t like the idea of making money out of sperm donation to buy new iPhones.

0357_04e24dd5-3703-476c-9578-09dfa2e08b56	English writer, actor and TV host Stephen Fry is coming to Adelaide for a special event celebrating the 40 th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in South Australia . \n \nThe Don Dunstan Foundation and Adelaide Festival Centre are presenting the November 29 talk, which will see the celebrated raconteur and gay rights advocate interviewed by ABC journalist Annabel Crabb. \n \nFry — best-known as the host of British television quiz show QI and for sketch comedies such as Blackadder and A Bit of Fry and Laurie –  is expected to discuss gay rights, mental health, his love of nature “and whatever else tickles his fancy”. \n \n“He’s just such an amazingly entertaining and spirited person, and he has a set of values that are easily captured in what he talks about,” Dunstan Foundation executive director Donna Harden told Adelaide news wesbite  InDaily today. \n \n“He’s worked very hard for gay rights. He’s been absolutely passionate about that subject.” \n \nFry’s two-part documentary  Out There , which screened in Australia last year, looked at the lives of gay people in different parts of the world and included a highly confrontational interview with a minister in Uganda’s government at the time it was seeking to make homosexuality a capital crime. \n \nHe has also worked to fight the stigma often attached to mental health problems, speaking about his own long battle with bipolar disorder in a program titled The Secret Life of a Manic Depressive as well as in his autobiographies. \n \nHarden said Fry’s interests, including the environment, aligned well with those of the Dunstan Foundation, a charitable trust with a focus on social justice issues. \n \nFry will be in Australia for most of November, touring the country with his new live show Telling Tales . However, Adelaide is not on the Telling Tales itinerary, so his talk at the Festival Theatre will be the only opportunity to see him here. \n \nHarden said the Dunstan Foundation first approached his management a year ago inviting him to come to South Australia. \n \n“He’s incredibly busy so there’s been a long wait period. I just threw it out there and hoped we would get a response — and not only did we get that, we got a really lovely response. \n \n“He’s sympathetic to the values we stand for and also the fact that it’s a celebration of the 40 th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality.” \n \nFry married his partner, Elliott Spencer, earlier this year and featured in a short film made by Irish comedians supporting a “yes” vote in Ireland’s gay marriage referendum in May. \n \nHarden said she didn’t know if he would weigh into Australia’s marriage equality debate while here, but added: “He’s a statement in himself … he’s married and I think he’s proud to show that and that’s where his sympathies lie.” \n \nThe Don Dunstan Foundation, in association with the Adelaide Festival Centre, will present Stephen Fry, in conversation with Annabel Crabb, at the Festival Theatre  from 5pm-6.30pm on November 29. Tickets will be available through BASS from noon tomorrow. \n This article was first published on InDaily     about the author: Suzie Keen
0358_581c58f8-5cec-4d48-9460-5c25788442b6	by Xinhua writers Zhou Xiaozheng, Chang Yuan and Wang Fan \n \nSEATTLE, United States, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- With Chinese President Xi Jinping set to land here Tuesday for his first state visit to the United States, this Pacific Northwest metropolis of 3.6 million people is eager to play the role of the perfect host while also expecting some positive outcomes. \n \n"I'm very excited about this, because it is such an exciting moment of continuing to expand all of our relationships which are on so many dimensions," said Washington State Governor Jay Inslee in a recent interview with Xinhua. \n \nThe governor will be among the welcoming crowd at the airport when the president's plane touches down on Tuesday morning. Xi is the second top Chinese leader to visit the bustling port city, the largest city in Washington state, in just 9 years. His predecessor Hu Jintao also visited Seattle in April 2006. \n \nThe city's connection with China can be traced back to 1979, when then Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping came here as part of a historic U.S. tour immediately after the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Seattle has received all successive top leaders of China in the past three and a half decades, a rare privilege for any major American city. \n \n"Seattle has played an important role in U.S.-China relations, and we are honored once again to host the leader of the world's largest nation (in terms of population) and second-largest economy," Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray said in a message posted on the government website. \n \n"The Nice Washington Has Welcome Mat Out," read a frontpage headline of the Sunday edition of The Seattle Times, which dedicated four pages of special reports to the upcoming visit by the Chinese president. \n \n"First I'm gonna make sure that he (Xi) is rested and has good food, that's the first thing for anybody who has been on the plane for eight or nine hours," Governor Inslee said, adding that he planned to offer the president a taste of the "very classic" local clam chowder as well as the fine wine produced in the state. \n \nBut compared with the daunting challenges of traffic and security, food and accommodation will be easy to provide for the hosts. \n \nAccording to the Chinese foreign ministry, a major highlight of Xi's visit will be his "extensive outreach to the American people," as he is expected to "meet people from all walks of life" during his two-and-a -half-day stay in Seattle. \n \nXi will have a very tight schedule featuring seven to eight major events, which include visits to the Microsoft campus and a Boeing plant, an appearance at a high-level business roundtable, and face-to-face interaction with local high school teachers and students, according to a detailed itinerary revealed by local media. \n \nIn the port city of Tacoma, some 50 km southwest of Seattle, many faculty members of the local Lincoln High School, including the principal himself, sacrificed their weekend to clean up the premises and prepare behind closed doors. \n \nThe century-old historic public school is said to have been picked for a visit by Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan on Wednesday. \n \nThe Tacoma School District also sent three painters to help refurbish parts of the school building's exterior. \n \n"As far as I know, this is the first time for the school to receive such an important visitor, and I believe heavyweight politicians from the state and the city will also be present on Wednesday," said one of the painters, who has served with the school district for 25 years and only identified himself as Frank. \n \nOn a tourist bus parked at the roadside right in front of the school, driver Raul from Seattle was patiently waiting for a group of Chinese visitors to return. "The presidential visit brings good business," he said with a smile. \n \nFor ordinary Seattleites, the impact of the presidential visit is more simple and direct. \n \n"I think it's a very good thing, and I like China because I have a brother who has lived there for 14 years doing business," said an African American porter at a four-star hotel in downtown Seattle, who introduced himself as Michael. \n \nBy going all out to ensure the success of Xi's visit, both Seattle and Washington are eying exciting opportunities and promising prospects for their future cooperation with China. \n \nAccording to Gary Locke, former Washington governor and also the first Chinese American to serve as the U.S. ambassador to China from 2011 to 2014, China is Washington state's top export destination, receiving more than 15 billion U.S. dollars in Washington-produced goods last year alone and supporting close to 90,000 jobs in the state. \n \nMeanwhile, Inslee believed there is still much more potential to tap, particularly in the export of agricultural products, including the local wine he would seriously persuade Xi to try. \n \n"We are very proud of our food products and our wine," he told Xinhua, insisting that Washington state's wines are at least on a par with their Californian counterparts, although the latter enjoy greater fame both at home and abroad. \n \nHe added that he also wants to use the opportunity of meeting with Xi along with a few other state governors to discuss possible cooperation in the field of clean energy and technologies to address mankind's common challenge of climate change. \n \n"Seattle benefits from close economic, cultural and educational ties to China," Murray said. "President Xi's visit is an important opportunity to deepen those ties and advance a constructive dialogue on policy issues important to both countries." \n \nCiting the success stories of Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks and Amazon.com, the mayor also stressed the "culture of innovation" deeply rooted in Seattle, which he believes has much in common with China's ongoing efforts to achieve an innovation-based economic restructuring. \n \nMeanwhile, some local media noted Xi's visit to and activities in Seattle may help show the world "what good U.S.-China relations would look like." \n \n"We have tremendous opportunities to grow a stronger, better and more economically productive relationship with China," Inslee said.
0359_57405592-2c40-4a30-b704-af47acd7e3c3	I'm fascinated by how much of Name of the Wind is carefully built to be consistent in large and small details, allowing the sort of detailed analysis Jo and lots of commentors made on Tor.\n\nThe summary posts there are quite good, as are some of the wikis, but does anyone know if there's anywhere the best speculation is helpfully organised by topic (like the wheel of time wiki used to)? Wherever I've looked has always included some interesting-but-later-discarded stuff, and not included everything.\n\nFrame Story\n\nA couple of things I was thinking about. One is what happened to Kvothe in the frame story. Most people accept that he has done something to become Kote, if it's not certain exactly what (changing his Name, hiding his true self by splitting his mind, etc). But what I hadn't realised is that maybe that wasn't so much something had already happened, as something that was ongoing. Like, Kvothe is deliberately becoming Kote, because he thinks its necessary, but he's also scared of it, or scared it's likely to be irreversible.\n\nThat would explain why sometimes he seems to be pretending, and sometimes he can do magic (in book one), but sometimes he can't (with the skin dancer): because the change is becoming fixed.\n\nThat might be what happens when he tries to open his box: it's keyed to him and he thinks it likely he's no longer himself, but gets the confirmation when he tries to open it (perhaps it contains his name or something else that might let him return).\n\nAnd Bast wants Kvothe to become his old self, which is why he set up the soldiers to attack him, in the hopes that he'd defend himself, and why he was so shocked when they beat him up. And maybe Kvothe did start to defend himself, and then suddenly remembered he needed to let go of being Kvothe and did so -- but that was scary because he knew he _would_ then be beaten up and wouldn't be able to back out of it...\n\nLackless Box\n\nSeriously, 3000 years? How can they KNOW that? Is that based on the age of Yllish knotwork? Or is fictional wood that lasts 3000 years significantly different to wood that lasts 2000 or 4000? Do they have any other 3000 year old wood to compare it to?\n\nI also note, our best guess for creation war was more like 6000 years ago, even though we'd assumed the box here is likely to be relevant to that story (containing the moon's name is an obvious guess, because that's the only box mentioned, but it doesn't quite fit). So either one of the dates is wrong. Or the box spent some time in faerie. Or the box is 3000 years old, but contains a smaller, older box.\n\nCollected speculation\n\nThings that I think are pretty much confirmed:\n\n99% Netalia Lackless ran off with Arliden and became Kvothe's mother\n99% Kvothe kills a king\n99% Kvothe did something to cause widespread civil war and directly or indirectly scrael etc loose\n99% Kvothe did something to become Kote\n99% Jax is Iax\nThe resolution of the story depends on, and reveals about:\n 99% doors of stone\n 99% lackless box\n 99% creation war\n 99% faerie\n 99% chandrian\n 99% denna and her patron\n 99% something auri gives kvothe\n 99% the real or metaphorical rings mentioned in the rhyme about kvothe \n 99% ctheah\n\nThings I think are likely to play an important part in what goes wrong or what fixes it, because they feel like loose ends, but don't have any specific justification for:\n\n90% Denna\n75% Bast\n75% Auri\n50% Knacks (as mentioned in the first few chapters and then not really again)\n50% Feud with Ambrose\n50% Hemme as chancellor\n\nBreaking the world:\n\n75% Kvothe does something supernatural to open doors to faerie or let the moon out or re-merge the realms, that unleashes fae creatures on the world, not just from mundane civil disorder\n50% Kvothe survives\n50% Kvothe fixes what's wrong\n\nTheories I really don't like, but sound plausible:\n\n50% Denna is some sort of supernatural spirit, not just a woman like Kvothe\n\nCreation War:\n\n90% Tehlu's origin is more like that described by Skarpi than by Trappis\n90% Encanis is based partly or mostly on Lanre\n65% Encanis is based entirely on Lanre/Haliax\n50% We get more of Lanre's story and it's more sympathetic than Kvothe thinks at the moment (but I've no idea if it's mostly sympathetic or only slightly)\n75% The Chandrian are trying to end the world because its the only way they can escape their existence.\n\nI may come back and update this with other bits as I remember them.\n\nYou can also comment at http://jack.dreamwidth.org/962697.html using OpenID.  comments so far.
0360_eb152073-949c-4e89-9119-3456b7fe70a2	WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show Russia-linked hackers tried at least five times to pry into Hillary Rodham Clinton's private email account while she was secretary of state. It is unclear if she clicked on any attachment and exposed her account.\n\nClinton received the infected emails, disguised as speeding tickets, over four hours early the morning of Aug. 3, 2011. The emails instructed recipients to print the attached tickets, which would have allowed hackers to take control of their computers.\n\nSecurity researchers who analyzed the malicious software have said that infected computers would transmit information from victims to at least three server computers overseas, including one in Russia. That doesn't necessarily mean Russians were responsible.
0361_cd158eba-26e4-4ea5-b700-704bee032df5	Posted Tuesday, September 22nd 2015 @ 9am  by Jenn Gidman,  Newser Staff \n \n\n \n( NEWSER ) – Pope Francis sets foot on US soil at 4pm today (full schedule  here ), and officials in DC, New York, and Philly are scrambling to ensure a smooth, safe stay. Here are five of the more unusual details of his visit: \n The visits has spurred one of the largest security operations in US history : The pope's five-day visit has received the rare designation of "National Special Security Event," the  Washington Post  reports, and the Secret Service-led security operation also involves the FBI, Coast Guard, Pentagon, and other agencies. Adding to the challenge: the pontiff's "proclivity to wade into public crowds," and the doubling-up of events. The 70th UN General Assembly and Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit are also on the docket  President Obama will meet him at the airport : When he arrives at Joint Base Andrews just outside DC, Obama will be there to greet him. This is actually a big deal. "It is a gesture the president has extended to virtually no other foreign visitor," observes the  New York Times .  No congressional handshakes : The pope's attendance at Thursday's joint session of Congress is a "sold-out" event, and those members who will be attending have received a "Please Behave Yourself" notice co-signed by John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, the  Post  reports. "Out of respect for the Pope's schedule and the expectation of a timely address, we respectfully request that you assist us by refraining from handshakes and conversations along and down the center aisle," the memo reads.  \nRead the full story on Newser.com
0362_cda5dfad-bcf7-4889-8355-de44a62e44e7	By Sept. 17, 2015, 11:31 a.m. exit \nIt is one of the biggest decisions in the history of financial markets, and it could easily alter the direction of the global economy. \n\nTomorrow morning, at about 4am (AEST), the US Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. If it does raise rates it would be momentous, signalling that finally (finally!) the world's biggest economy has recovered from the global financial crisis. \n\nBut how much do we really know about the 10 people who will actually make this critical call? \n\nThe Fed is split between "doves", who are more inclined to support looser monetary policy, and its "hawks", who are more concerned about inflation and more likely to support higher rates. \n\nBut there is a lot more to these people. Did you know for example that:  \nJanet Yellen, the chair of the FOMC, grew up in the working class Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bay Ridge Only two of the ten voting members of the FOMC are women: Yellen, and Lael Brainard For the conspiracy theorists, only one member of the FOMC, New York president Bill Dudley, is an alumnus of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, which some people think secretly runs the Fed.  For the other conspiracy theorists, only one member of the FOMC is an alumnus of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co, Lael Brainard ​One member, Jerome Powell, worked for the secretive and well connected private equity firm, Carlyle Group One member, Denis Lockhart, previously served in the military All but three members of the FOMC have PhD's in economics.  One, Stanley Fischer, previously ran another central bank (the Bank of Israel). Fischer is a dual citizen and was born in Zambia. At least four members served as advisers to former President Bill Clinton One (Powell), was an adviser to President George W Bush \nA few weeks ago, it looked like a done deal that the Fed would finally "hike", having pumped trillions of dollars into the world's banking system in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. \n\nSince then, China's economy, currency and equity markets have all started to wobble,  sending ripple effects across the world, and causing many economists to revise their predictions and implore the Fed to hold off. \n\nStill, 51 of the 113 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Fed to raise rates. \n\nThe story Meet the 10 people with the fate of the world in their hands first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .
0363_3378b1a5-03be-4bf1-aaf5-18bd84a73e33	Ferenc Gyurcsany is busy chopping onions and carrots to throw into a pot of boiling lentils. It's not your typical Hungarian breakfast, but he wants his house guests to feel at home. \n\nGyurcsany served as prime minister of Hungary from 2004 to 2009. Today, he leads the opposition in Parliament. He says that his house, in a leafy, upscale neighborhood of Budapest, is big enough to share. And for the last few weeks, he and his wife, Klara Dobrev, have been doing just that — welcoming migrants into their home to spend what he calls "one normal night." \n\nWhile the Hungarian government has been hostile toward the thousands of migrants trying to cross the country, citizens like Gyurcany have come forth to help them. \n\nThe contrast couldn't be starker than between the country's current prime minister, Viktor Orban — who wants to treat migrants as criminals — and Gyurcsany. \n\n"It grabs a couple of hours from our life, but what's that compared to the fate of these people?" says Gyurcsany. "It's nothing." \n\nHe says helping in this way has given him an incomparable emotional lift — more than anything he's done in several years. \n\nThe 54-year-old center-left politician says the conservative government's handling of the migrant crisis is abysmal. But he says it's mostly about internal Hungarian politics, as the government's ruling party tries to attract voters from the far right. \n\n"There is a very ugly rivalry between the Hungarian center-right and extremist right," says Gyurcsany. "It's a very dirty political business." \n\nGyurscany and Dobrev, who have five children, moved their six-month-old baby into their own bedroom to offer more space for migrant families. They're working with a charity group that helps identify particularly exhausted migrants to host. \n\nOn this morning, a family from Syria and two young Syrian men traveling alone are just waking up. \n\nDobrev serves them coffee on a back porch that looks onto a lush lawn. Thirty-eight-year-old Almoen, who fears giving his last name, fled Syria with his wife and three children. He says the journey was harrowing, and the family was exhausted and filthy after being in three different Hungarian camps. \n\nAs he sits and drinks his coffee, Almoen looks around in disbelief. "Everything was so bad. And here everybody is good. So nice. People smile. It's so different here. I am happy," he says. \n\nOne of Almoen's little boys plays with the cat and dog. Dobrev believes the most important thing she and her husband do is simply to treat people like human beings. \n\n"Sometimes I have the feeling that it's not only the food or the possibility to use the bathroom or wash their hair," says Dobrev. "But it's the gesture itself, because these people have received so few human gestures in the past few months." \n\nThe sounds of Hungarian, Arabic and English float across the table as the group sits down to a hearty breakfast. The lentils are a big hit. And Gyurcsany pushes his guests to try Hungarian pastries. \n\nThe couple asks me to turn off my microphone as they discuss where to take this Syrian family when they leave their house. There are no good options. The Syrians want to press on to Germany, but don't know if they'll be able to make it to the Austrian border — or even be able to cross it, if they do. \n\nHungary is cracking down on migrants and those who assist them by making entering the country illegally a criminal offense. Gyurcsany says his own family held a meeting to discuss whether they would continue bringing migrants into their home in the worsening climate. \n\nTheir decision was unanimous. \n\n"There is a rule of life, and there is a rule of the government of Hungary. And if these two rules are conflicting," he says, "we have to choose the rule of life."
0364_ffc0f7c0-9612-41fa-9c67-eef9c155f889	BY JAIME MADDOX\nI’ve never blogged before. This is mostly because I’ve never had much to say, and I don’t want to waste people’s time reading a blog about nothing. Now, though, I’ve finally found a topic that’s worthy of your time. I almost feel it’s fate, because the stars aligned at just the right time.\n\nI’m hiring a new doctor to work in my medical office, and it just so happens that one of Deadly Medicine’s  main characters faces the same challenge. Hospital CEO Abby Rosen has to replace a sick ER director, and the topic is perfect fodder for my first blog.\n\nWhen I started out in private practice, I needed doctors to work the few hours each week I reserved for my family. I relied on a few old friends to help me out. They were my mentors; I would have trusted them with my life.\n\nHow did you choose your family doctor? If you’re like most people, he or she came recommended by someone you trust, someone who had a good experience with them. When you needed your knee surgery, I’m sure you followed the same process, and looked around for someone “good”.\n\nWhen you go to the ER, there’s no time for background checks . It’s an emergency, right? You’re relying on the reputation of the hospital. They’ve reviewed the doctor’s credentials. They’re properly trained, and a background check would have uncovered any issues, right? In Abby’s case, she’s relying on the company she’s hired to have done all of that. That’s their job.\n\nYou would think so, but that’s not necessarily the case.\n\nAre you aware of how many ERs are staffed? Most often, a company bids on the ER contract for a hospital, and supplies doctors to staff it. Some of these companies own many contracts, in multiple states. Doctors don’t even know who their working for. How can companies know the doctors? Most often they rely on a resume. But just because someone looks good on paper, doesn’t mean they are.\n\nAnd what happens when there aren’t enough qualified, emergency trained and board certified doctors to fill the schedule? Don’t forget, ERs run 24/7/365. They can’t close the ER. They must find someone to work.\n\nSo, how do these companies operate?\n\nThe turn to staffing companies, like the one Abby used. Or they hire local doctors. Anyone who is willing to try their hand at emergency medicine. Some of them might be competent, even qualified. Some are excellent. Some are not. You may find some family docs who are tired of the grind of private practice. They may be good at managing your blood pressure, but they have no formal training in trauma, and not much in critical care. Internists work the ERs too, but most have zero experience in pediatrics, orthopedics, trauma, and gynecology. Those cases account for about half of ER visits.\n\nDoes an Ob-Gyn doctor working weekends in the ER sound crazy to you? It does to me too, but I’ve seen it.\n\nOver time, these doctors may become proficient in the practice of emergency medicine. They take courses on cardiac arrest, and attend trauma conferences. When they’ve been in the ER for a dozen years, they’ve probably picked up the skills they need to do a good job. If not, to their credit, their professional colleagues will probably have them fired…and then, they’ll move on to another hospital.\n\nWhat about the background check when they get there? It’s only as good as the people who supply the data. In the opening chapter of Deadly Medicine, Dr. Edward Hawk, our psychopathic villain, is terminated from his position. Although he’s suspected of murder, no one calls the police. They simply show him to the door. On his way out, though, he’s given a letter of reference for his next employer.\n\nSound unbelievable? It’s plausible. A doctor has to do something really awful, and have it witnessed by many people, for his colleagues to report him. Those minor things, we blow off. Give people the benefit of the doubt. After all, we’re all in the same boat. I don’t want someone to report me, right?\n\nI once worked with a family doctor who killed a woman in the ER. He wasn’t a psychopath like my villain Hawk, he was just incompetent. The patient was about thirty years old, and healthy. What could be so bad? When she came to the ER, her complaint was a headache. Not just any headache, though. This was the worst headache of her life.\n\nDing! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!\n\nThe worst headache of your life is without question a subarachnoid hemorrhage until proven otherwise. Every ER doctor knows this. An aneurism in the brain has leaked, and if it isn’t repaired immediately, chances are good the patient will die. The only way to diagnose this condition is by lumbar puncture. Dr. Jessica Benson does an LP in Deadly Medicine, and she does it easily. She is a highly trained, very skilled emergency physician.\n\nInstead of an LP, this patient’s doctor ordered a CT scan of the brain. As is often the case with brain hemorrhage, it was normal, and she was discharged with pain medication. A few days later, the aneurism ruptured, rendering her instantly unconscious. This time, the CT scan was positive. Her brain was flooded with blood. She was placed on a ventilator, but with no evidence of brain activity, her husband pulled the plug.\n\nThe doctor who originally treated her had never heard the legend of The Worst Headache of Your Life, even though it’s taught to all ER residents, on or about the first day. His training did not include a basic procedure that would have saved this woman’s life. Yet he was hired to take care of her, and all the other unsuspecting people who ventured into the ER, because the hospital needed someone with a medical license present in the ER.\n\nThis story is not fiction. I witnessed it, and too many other incidents to count.\n\nIn parting, I will give you a piece of free medical advice, my little thank-you for reading my first blog. When you go into the ER, or the urgent care, or whenever you are under the care of a doctor you’re meeting for the first time, ask a simple question. How long have you been here?\n\nIf they’re wearing a diamond chipped watch for ten years of service, you’re probably okay. If they still can’t find the cafeteria, ask a few more questions.

0367_f5fd3859-5519-49ff-8fa8-ee546fd283ea	Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping are due to meet again during a state visit to the US by the Chinese leader in September. However, tensions over security issues are high. Photo:   \n  \nAfter six bruising and sometimes humiliating years grappling with the great global challenger, Barack Obama reckons he's learned some lessons. This time, instead of offering to share the global leadership podium, as he did in his first presidential visit to China, Obama is welcoming the Chinese President to Washington with an unambiguous threat. \n\n"There comes a point at which we consider this a core national security threat," said Obama, answering a question about cyberattacks from a member of the Pentagon's new cyberwarfare unit, while visiting troops at the US Cyber Command and National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade. If China and others cannot work within acceptable limits, "we can choose to make this an area of competition, which I guarantee you we'll win if we have to". \n  \nBoth sides are signalling firmness and determination, rather than co-operation. And that's really dangerous.   \n Susan Shirk, University of California   \nChina's President Xi Jinping will be walking into a very different President Obama to the one who began by promising to "extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist". It will be a less relaxing conversation than the eight hours they shared in Sunnylands two years ago, when these charismatic leaders were building their rapport. \n\nBetween Obama's first China summit in 2009, in Beijing, and what will probably be his last in Washington on Thursday and Friday, he has shed the old humble willingness to give his Chinese counterpart "face" at the cost of his own, in the hope of building the trust required to jointly solve the world's most pressing problems. Instead, this encounter of the world's two most powerful men is being framed by grim brinkmanship on both sides. \n \nXi, as chairman of the Central Military Commission, has just finished building an extraordinary archipelago of artificial islands, which will enable him to defend audacious territorial claims and project military power deep into the South China Sea. US defence leaders have replied with promises of "fly throughs" and "sail throughs" to puncture China's implicit territorial claims, while warning against militarisation of those islands. \n THE SUPERPOWER THREE-STAR RATING   \n1. Chinese cyber attacks: \nIt's looming as the greatest daylight robbery in global history and the thieves are getting away \n   \n2. China's building fake islands: \nLand reclamations in the Spratlys are all done. Nothing can stop airstrips, armaments and ports \n   \n3. Close-in military surveillance: \nChina has been harassing US spy flights and vessels for 15 years, to no avail \n   \n4. China's human rights crackdown: \nBeijing is waging war on Chinese civil society, while the US stands idly by \n   \n5. Regional Institutions: \nUS fumbled China's infrastructure bank and its own TPP, but has rallied support in ASEAN \n   \n6. Taiwan: \nThe harder China pushes, the further its dreams of Taiwan's 'liberation' drift away \n   \n7. Making friends in Asia: \nThe US has never been so popular, China has rarely been so feared \n   \n8. Weaving maritime military alliances: \nWhile China draws closer to Russia, the US weaves alliances with everyone else \n   \n9. Economy: \nChina's 40-year economic miracle is looking shaky, US recovery is underway \n   \n10. 'Soft' cultural power: \nAvengers, Star Wars, Mad Max v ... anti-Japanese propaganda films? \n  \nIn July, Chinese intelligence agencies were blamed for the largest publicly acknowledged data heist in cyber history, involving the theft of data from 21.5 million US government personnel files. Obama responded with cyber sanction threats. \n\nA fortnight ago Xi sent his security chief to Washington on a secret mission to placate the Americans with an offer of cyber reassurance, just in time to save their summit. Before doing so, however, Xi sent five PLA Navy ships through the Aleutian Islands, within the 12 nautical mile US territorial zone, just off the coast of Alaska, where Obama happened to be making a visit. \n\nAnd just in case the subtleties were misinterpreted, last week a senior Chinese military leader made clear that he wasn't interested in only the narrow band of water around Chinese-controlled islands. He wanted the whole maritime expanse from China's southern coast to the tip of Indonesia. "The South China Sea, as the name indicated, is a sea area. It belongs to China," said the commander of China's North Sea Fleet. \n\nStrategists often remind us that this is not the Cold War. They point to the extraordinary breadth of trans-Pacific engagement in terms of people, ideas and money. But such reassurance goes only so far. Strategic uncertainty is rapidly rising. \n \nChinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama. Photo:  \n \nSusan Shirk, who ran the State Department's China desk in the Clinton administration, says Obama's cyber ultimatum shows he is prepared to wear a significant cost to his own interests – including the cancellation of the most important bilateral meeting anywhere in the world this year – to signal his resolve. And this, she notes, is a profound departure from how American presidents have traditionally played the "summitry" game. \n\n"Even in the Cold War the US and Soviet Union used summitry to highlight the possibility of avoiding war and co-operating with each other," says Shirk, chairwoman of the 21st Century China program at the University of California, San Diego. "This time, both sides are wanting to show they're willing to risk more tension in the relationship to achieve their objectives, especially in cyber and the South China Sea, and also with economics and human rights. Both sides are signalling firmness and determination, rather than co-operation. And that's really dangerous." \n\nA lot has been written about Australia's new Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, coming into the job with a more "nuanced", "independent" or "soft" China policy, based mainly on old speeches. But not enough has been said about how China has changed in the intervening years. \n\nTurnbull took the opposition leader's reins late in 2008, in the depths of the global financial crisis, when much of the world was consumed by a mix of awe, fear and giddy admiration for China's seemingly inexorably rising economic power. He lost the leadership in 2009. Hillary Clinton's quip to prime minister Kevin Rudd that year – "How do you deal toughly with your banker?" – provides a sense of how the power relativities were being perceived at the time. \n\nBack then, many were convinced China would liberalise its rigid political controls to facilitate the leap to a consumer-driven, services-based modern economy. That model has gone out the window as analysts struggle to explain Xi's sabre-rattling abroad and deepening ideological controls at home. Says Shirk: "It's mind-boggling to see a personalistic dictatorship re-emerge in China." \n\nSo far, in strategic terms, Xi's muscle-flexing has been counterproductive. He's energised Japan's staunchly nationalist Abe administration, set the rest of China's maritime neighbours on edge and reinforced a web of security relationships around China's great strategic rival, the United States. \n\nPhilippine President Benigno Aquino has made comparisons with Nazi Germany. Vietnam has built bridges with its old foe, the United States. And India joined a regional chorus demanding "freedom of navigation", backed by ambitious naval exercises with Australia this week, while making the point that the surrounding maritime expanse does not belong to India just because it's called the Indian Ocean. \n \nUS President Barack Obama (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a press conference at the Great Hall of People in Beijing in 2014. Photo:  \n \nIn Asia, at least, in this emerging game of strategic competition, China's losses are America's gains. \n\n"They've managed to take long-time complicated relationships for the US and make them into allies," the chairman of the US House intelligence committee, Devin Nunes told Fairfax Media in a recent visit. \n\nOver the span of the Obama administration, as the Chinese economy has doubled in size, the US has deepened its ties with every maritime nation in the Indo-Pacific at China's expense, with the exception of the two Koreas. Growing fears of China have fuelled a regional demand for US military engagement that is virtually insatiable. "If the entire US Navy was stationed in the East China Sea [and] South China Sea the question I would still get [is] 'when is the rebalance going to be real, what more can you send to the region?'" Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, says. \n\nPerhaps the greatest casualty of China's political muscle-flexing has been the story of an inexorably rising economy, which ultimately underpins all else. Xi's much-touted economic reforms have not eventuated. Ham-fisted efforts to inflate a sharemarket bubble and stop it from deflating have tainted China's policy-making record. \n\nA confidential survey released by Consensus Economics found that economic forecasters believe the Chinese economy grew at 4.3 per cent last quarter, which is a little more than half of the official figure of 7 per cent. If that estimate is roughly right, then America's GDP growth rate might be catching up to China's for the first time in 40 years. \n\n"Has there ever been a better moment to come back to the question how to be tough with your banker?" says Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \n\nBut just because the balance of power is shifting in Obama's favour doesn't mean he's willing to use it. \n\nAs Turnbull receives his military, security and diplomatic briefings over the coming days and weeks he will discover a Canberra bureaucracy that is exasperated with the Obama administration's failings in Asia. He'll find the paradigm of the US pulling Australia away from its long-term strategic interests makes no sense, because it's Canberra that has been doing the pulling. \n \nPresident Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California, in 2013. Photo: New York Times \n \nThe mandarins in Canberra were horrified by Washington's incompetent response to China's Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. They were shocked that Obama sent his trade representative to Hawaii to seal the Trans-Pacific Partnership without room from Congress to negotiate a palatable deal. They were dismayed that the administration could threaten to conduct "freedom of navigation" exercises but fail to follow through. Most recently, they suspect Obama will baulk – again – before enforcing his new cyber red lines. Canberra's frustrations stems from its desire for the US to be more effectively engaged, not less. \n\n"This is the worst civilian Asia team we've seen since before World War II," says one senior official. "Secretary of State [John] Kerry is simply not interested in Asia," says another. And a third: "If I'm held hostage somewhere I would hope to God that this [National Security Council] team is not responsible for rescuing me." \n\nThis week the Republican candidates were out-toughing each other, promising to retaliate for Chinese cyber incursions and arguing whether or not to cancel next week's state dinner. Obama confirmed that sanctions were still on the table. He vowed that if cyberspace is going to be "weaponised", and the US is forced to switch from "defence" to "offence", then the US would be playing to win. \n\nNevertheless, at least for the duration of this US presidential term, the Asia-Pacific strategic scorecard may well be decided by the home goals that are tallying up on both sides. And that's why it's hard to find anyone, in Washington or Beijing, who can muster much enthusiasm for next week's big event. \n\n"It's like finding yourself on a date with somebody you already know you really don't like," says Richardson, at Human Rights Watch, who has been trying to encourage the Obama administration to engage with China's lawyers, journalists and scholars, whose freedoms are under threat. "But you've got to make it through the evening somehow."
0368_1e74b409-c1bd-4bef-a19d-56bc17147df4	U.S. District Judge David Bunning has issued an order saying Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis will be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshal's Office after nearly a week in custody. \n  \nThe order, filed today, says Davis shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples. \n \nOriginally jailed and held in contempt for refusing to comply with court orders, Davis has since been lodged in the Carter County Detention Center since last Thursday. \n \nThe official order reads: \n "Defendant Davis shall be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshal forthwith. Defendant Davis shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples. If Defendant Davis should interfere in any way with their issuance, that will be considered a violation of this Order and appropriate sanctions will be considered."  \nA status hearing has been set for this Thursday and this order makes it unclear as to what Bunning's next action will be. \n \nHowever, “appropriate sanctions” will be considered if Davis does not comply, Bunning said. \n \nThe judge has also ordered court-appointed lawyers for the deputies to report every 14 days on their compliance. \n \nAccording to reports ,  Davis' lawyers did not immediately respond to questions about whether she will comply with the order. \n \nAs Davis awaits release, a large crowd of supporters and protestors alike have gathered for an impending political rally. 
0369_b18dd8f3-e881-44fd-a24b-a78fa59ebc0a	The Heart Goes Last: A Novel by Margaret Atwood; Nan A. Talese (320 pages, $26.95) \n\n--- \n\nIn the gritty initial chapters of Margaret Atwood's "The Heart Goes Last," an epic "financial-crash business-wrecking meltdown" has triggered an equally devastating implosion of civil society. \n\nHomelessness is endemic. Marauding bands rape, rob and kill. Murders go uninvestigated; "only rich people can afford to have police." And most of them have left the crumbling building, to live offshore on "tax-free sea platforms." \n\nThere's no such plush platform awaiting Stan and Charmaine, hardworking Americans who married each other because it was safe, in a world where nothing is sure. But when they lose their jobs and then their home and begin living out of a car, their seemingly solid if stolid marriage begins to fray. \n\nThat makes them easy marks for the Orwellian types running the town of Consilience and its prison, Positron. Those who choose to move there get to spend six months each year in comfy homes. But every other month must be spent as a Positron inmate. One's "civilian" home is shared with a second couple, who occupy it during the months one spends in the slammer. \n\nIt's not quite as bizarre as it sounds - not when one considers the number of Americans working toxic, dead-end jobs involving too many hours and too little money, all so they can spend their remaining hours in the homes for which they work. We trade freedom for apparent security. Every day. \n\nAtwood has been exploring how that trade-off works - as well as just what sorts of trades we're willing to make - for a long time, especially in the novel to which this one is bound to be compared: "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985), in which the theocracy of Gilead enslaves women in the name of protecting them. \n\nThe Positron Project, as it's called, adapts a similarly cloying, creepy and ultimately controlling approach toward its subjects. To "avoid overexcitement," there's no rock, hip-hop or porn. The 1950s have been chosen "for the visual and audio aspects," because people then were allegedly happier. \n\nThere's technology, but it all operates on a closed circuit; one can't communicate with the outside world. And after entering this world, one isn't permitted to leave. Ever. \n\n"The whole town is under a bell jar," we're told, and it's hard to miss the allusion to Sylvia Plath - in a novel demonstrating Atwood's customary awareness that women have it worse off in dystopia, just as they do everywhere else. \n\nBut unlike "The Handmaid's Tale" - a richer book with much more textured characters - "Heart" often seems to exist within a similarly airless bell jar, under which characters like Stan, Charmaine and everyone else enact a contrived and cartoonish plot, unspooled with a jaunty, even snarky insouciance. \n\nIt's as though Atwood can't quite bring herself to take these characters seriously. Or, perhaps, she's trying to convey what happens when we reduce people to commodities - capable, here, of being continually repurposed and repackaged. Are we, as one character asks, no more than a few plasticized features and gestures? If so, what makes us human? And if so, can literature matter? \n\nInteresting philosophical questions, but the way they're presented here undermines what could have been a much better novel. Instead we get satire that's too broad to bite and too self-consciously clever for readers to care. \n\nAnd we really should care, given that topics covered in "Heart" not only include the inverse relation between freedom and security, but also sex slavery, trafficking in body parts, brainwashing, artificial intelligence, censorship, how relationships work and why marriages fail. For starters. \n\nAtwood's novel is ultimately a nonstarter because it fails to practice what her title rightly preaches: Even in a world gone to hell, the human heart offers us hope of something more and better. When one's characters become as heartless as the robots they build, reading about them gets reduced to mechanically going through the motion of turning the pages.
0370_6c4086f4-9bd2-435f-a70b-83bef6f813f4	Hubby and I enjoyed a busy, wonderful and rewarding weekend in our neck of the woods. Saturday, we attended the 'Walk Across America' in Las Vegas. The event was hosted by Christine S., a family friend and Chiari Malformation sufferer. This year I felt well enough to participate in the walk with my husband. I talked with several sufferers, learned and discovered that we had much in common, as Spoonies. Here's hoping that 2015 will bring great news of a cure. Saturday night, we attended Pigs For Kids Championship BBQ, this event benefit 3 children cancers charities. Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, Cure for the Kids Foundation and Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.\nThe food was amazing! At least that's what my husband said while enjoying ribs and baked beans. I was able to enjoy pulled pork with no sauce but I did have to medicate myself before, during and after so I didn't have a severe attack. It was truly worth it.\nThere was live music, games, ride, and vendors too. We really enjoyed out busy Saturday! Organized Junkie\nThis week's menu is all about chicken and pork.

0371_124ddbe2-7a24-49dc-986b-40a01a32fea1	(CNN) -  \nAndy Murray will have to wait until next year for another crack at a grand slam. \n \nSuffering an ignominious defeat to South African Kevin Anderson in four sets, Murray looked frustrated and often powerless against the 15th seed who played out of his skin. \n\nAnderson took the game 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6. \n\nMurray, the World No. 3, complained to himself and the umpire repeatedly -- often in expletive-laden tirades caught on camera -- about everything from perceived game delays by Anderson to line calls. \n\nThe truth is, it just wasn't his day. \n\nGoing into the match, the 29-year-old Anderson was an unlikely candidate to dominate a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion. \n\nIn his ninth year on the pro circuit, Anderson has had only three tour victories to his name and never advanced beyond the fourth round at a Grand Slam. \n\nBut the 6'8" Johannesburg native was a force throughout the match, battling nerves only occasionally. He was broken early in the third set before losing it on a tiebreak, before coming back with an assured performance in the fourth set. \n\nAnderson played aggressively and took chances, pouring 25 aces past a sometimes helpless Murray, who was denied a 20th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal run. \n\nHe hit 81 winners during the match against Murray's 49, and rushed the net 58 times versus 24 approaches for Murray. In fact, Anderson has been the most prolific net player in the entire U.S. Open, often displaying a graceful touch belying his giant frame. \n\n"I'm a little lost for words right now. I was just trying to keep my composure against Andy, and I honestly played one of the best matches of my life," said Anderson, who clinched the fourth set tiebreak to win. \n\n"He's such a fighter, and such an amazing player, I knew I had to try my best and just stick with it," he said. \n\nFederer raises game to down Isner \n\nWorld No. 2 Roger Federer faced No. 13 seed John Isner in the late match in Arthur Ashe Stadium, ultimately handling the big American's serve in three tight sets, winning the match 7-6, 7-6, 7-5. The Swiss player made his way to the quarterfinals for the 11th time with a vintage Federer performance, keeping alive his hopes of raising the trophy at Flushing Meadows for a sixth time. \n\nFederer kept his nerve throughout, not losing his serve to Isner once. For his part, Isner fought back gamely, only losing his serve once at the very end, and taking nine break points away from the winner. However, he was not able to match his 2011 U.S. Open-best quarterfinal result. \n\nObviously John has one of the best serves in the game," Federer said after the win. "You just gotta hang around and make sure you don't drop your serve." \n\nThe 34-year-old, 17-time Grand Slam men's singles champion has been on form throughout the summer, climbing back up the rankings to breathe down world number one Novak Djokovic. He's next set to play 12 seed Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals. \n\nMissing shoes \n\nTemperatures soared once again on the hard courts of Flushing Meadow in a competitive, and sometimes quirky, eighth day of action at the U.S. Open. \n\nFrench Open champion Stan Wawrinka took four sets to cruise past American upstart Donald Young, in a match that saw a bizarre build-up. \n\nYoung -- who had battled back from two sets down in his previous two matches at the Open -- had his locker mistakenly cleared out the day before the match, leaving him scrambling to find equipment until shortly before the match. \n\n"Unfortunately, I came to the locker room yesterday and I opened it up and it was clean," said Young, a former junior World No 1. "Like a couple shirts missing, all my shoes were gone, and apparently someone said I was out of the tournament, so the guys thought I went home. They were taking some souvenirs." \n\nYoung showed some signs of life, taking the second set from Warwinka 6-1, before dropping the third and fourth sets. \n\nWarwinka will face Anderson in an intriguing quarterfinal matchup. \n\nMeanwhile, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who opened play in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday, took just under one hour to knock out her fourth round opponent American Varvara Lepchenko, in straight sets.
0372_b44708ed-4218-43fc-89a3-84978d3158e3	A two-year-old died when her father accidentally ran her down in what a coroner described as "one of the most tragic cases" she has seen.\n\nEvelyn Celgy was killed outside Nottingham's Capital FM Arena where her family were due to attend a bible convention where her mother was speaking.\n\nThe toddler, from Crewe, was struck at low speed by the Nissan Qashqai driven by her father Celgy Thomas at around 8am on Saturday July 11.\n\nEvelyn, described by her father as a "happy child", was rushed to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre but later died of her injuries.\n\nMr Thomas said he did not see his daughter standing in front of the car as he pulled away from a drop-off point where he left his wife, two sons and Evelyn.\n\nIn a statement read at Nottingham Coroner's Court, Mr Thomas described the moment of the accident.\n\nHe said: "I had only moved a short distance when I heard my wife scream. I had only travelled one car length or one-and-a-half.\n\n"Initially I thought the boys were misbehaving."\n\nMr Thomas said he got out of the car and realised what had happened.\n\nHe said: "To my horror, I could see her lying six feet away. Evelyn was not moving and was unconscious.\n\n"I realised I had accidentally run over her. I called her name but she was unresponsive.\n\n"My wife was crying. I began to scream."\n\nOther people attending the Sehion UK Convention - including a doctor - began to help and Evelyn was taken by paramedics to hospital, but she later died of a traumatic brain injury. The inquest heard evidence from forensic crash investigator Pc Mark Gascoigne, who said the raised driving position in the Qashqai meant Evelyn was standing in a blind spot.\n\nHe said: "These types of vehicles have an inherent problem where we have a substantial blind spot when you are dealing with bollards."\n\nCoroner Mairin Casey said it was clear Mr Thomas was not at fault for the death of his daughter.\n\nRecording a verdict of death by a road traffic collision, she said: "This wasan incident that happened by chance without an apparent cause.\n\n"It was unexpected. It was unpredictable." Addressing Mr Thomas, she said: "I know you will have gone through this inyour mind many, many times.\n\n"This is a case that I can describe cause that in many ways is a very simple forensic case, but in terms of the level of tragedy involved, it is difficult toimagine a more tragic scenario.\n\n"There is nothing you could have done to avoid this situation."
0373_1aa8b2eb-27e0-41f2-b93d-25ca1b78a26f	Full coverage: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresident Xi Visits U.S.   Full coverage:  China’s Leader    \nBEIJING, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- The fight against corruption never ends and the zero tolerance to corruption will never change, Chinese president Xi Jinping said in a written interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday. \n \n"Cracking down on corruption is what all countries must do and what their peoples wish to see. The ultimate purpose of the Chinese Communist Party is to serve the people wholeheartedly," Xi said in the interview ahead of his U.S. visit. \n \nHe left Beijing Tuesday afternoon for the state visit at the invitation of U.S. President Barack Obama. \n \n"Our Party owes its governing status to the support of the people, so we must maintain its flesh-and-blood ties with the people," Xi said. \n \nThe Party does not operate in a vacuum, so it has unavoidably found itself with problems of one kind or another, Xi said, adding that corruption is just such a persistent one. \n \nThe Party must be courageous enough to face up to the problem and go out to correct it through self-purification and self-rectification, Xi said. \n \n"Our people hate corruption more than anything else and we must act to allay their concerns. Therefore, we decided to go after both 'tigers and flies', wrongdoers regardless of their ranks." \n \nSince the 18th Party Congress, China has intensified anti-corruption efforts, dealt with a large number of corrupt officials in accordance with law, including some who used to hold very high offices, and won extensive support and thumbs-up from the Chinese people. \n \n"On institutional building in this respect, let me share with you two remarks I made. The first is that we must keep power in the cage of systemic checks. The other one is, transparency is the best precaution against corruption," Xi said. \n \nAs we go further in anti-corruption campaign, we will focus more on institutional building so that officials will not dare and cannot afford to be corrupt and, more importantly, have no desire to take that course, Xi said. \n \nRight now, we are formulating and updating relevant laws and regulations to truly put power inside a more closely-knit cage of effective checks, the president said. \n \nWith respect to asset disclosure by officials, China adopted relevant regulations back in 2010 to require such reporting which was subject to random check and verification every year. \n \nXi said the proportion of verified reporting has increased steadily, and no one would take exception. Should anyone be found to be dishonest, they will be punished accordingly. \n \n"I once said that the fight against corruption never ends. Our zero tolerance to corruption will never change. Nor will our determination, courage and severity with which we punish it in order to rid the Party of corruption." \n \nAll acts of corruption must be dealt with, Xi said. \n \nAnti-corruption efforts will not hurt the economy. On the contrary, fighting corruption, including such malpractices as rent-seeking, will help build a clean government, remove hurdles that impede market operations, promote fair rules and bring about a better investment and business environment, Xi said. 
0374_0fadf848-c76a-4a4f-a4b7-32d04901905d	PORTSMOUTH — Hoteliers Dan Innis and Doug Palardy toured the troubled Brewster Street rooming house on Tuesday, when Palardy said it's one of multiple properties they're scouting for a micro-housing project. "I'm one of several making inquiries," Palardy said about the rooming house that was damaged during a Sept. 3 fire that officials are calling "suspicious."  Palardy said he and Innis are looking at "multiple places" in the Portsmouth area for property they could convert into small units of affordable housing. The Brewster Street rooming house, "is one place we're entertaining," he said. "We want to do affordable, cool housing in Portsmouth."  To achieve that, he said, the couple is looking for property that could be converted into 350- to 400-square-foot apartments, within walking and bicycling distance from the downtown. He said he and Innis have historically paid employees of their downtown businesses well, but those employees were still unable to find affordable apartments in Portsmouth.  Palardy said the couple's vision is to have open-concept, loft-like apartments with lots of light. When they operated a pair of hotels in Portsmouth, the couple was known for their urban modern design. Palardy said he's "hoping and praying" city officials will "get on board with approving small apartments." In neighboring Kittery, Maine, he said, he and Innis considered micro-housing there, but learned the town has a 650-square-foot minimum for a rental unit to be considered an apartment.  "We're looking to get Kittery to change," he said. "It seems like Portsmouth is open to it." Innis and Palardy bought the former Sisse Inn in November 2013 and transformed it into the hip Hotel Portsmouth. In June, they sold it to Lark Group, which made an irresistible offer when the property wasn't even on the market, Palardy said. At the time of that sale, Palardy  said  it would allow them to focus on "new pursuits" and he hinted that it could have something to do with workforce housing. The couple sold their boutique hotel, Ale House Inn, also to Lark Group, in 2013.  The fire at the Brewster Street rooming house remains under investigation, according to District Chief Stacey Dubois, from the New Hampshire Fire Marshal's office. The three-story rooming house burned during a "heavy fire" that extended from the ground to the roof, Fire Chief Steve Achilles said earlier this month. Residents had been relocated due to building-code violations, so the building was vacant and no one was injured. In the years prior to the fire, city officials took owner Brian Hogan to court at least twice to force him to bring the building up to code. The rooming house was also the subject of numerous police calls. Palardy said the rooming house is not officially on the market and Hogan could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.

0376_388b13a8-d95a-471c-b41e-ec78886d4bf0	Jenson Button is confident his Formula One future will be resolved by the end of the month. \n \nSpeaking after the Italian Grand Prix a fortnight ago, Button was hopeful an announcement would be made ahead of this week's iconic night race in Singapore. \n \nButton signed a two-year contract with McLaren in December, but the British team have an option on whether to retain him for 2016 - a clause which is said to expire at the end of September. \n \nYoung McLaren charges Kevin Magnussen, not here in Singapore this weekend after falling off his bike and breaking his hand, and Stoffel Vandoorne, the runaway GP2 series leader, are waiting in the wings. \n \nBut Button appears to be growing ever-optimistic that he will extend his evergreen grand prix career into a 17th campaign. \n \n"I said the next couple of weeks at the last race and I was wrong," Button said when asked about a time frame for an announcement. "So, I think the next couple of weeks - by the end of the month definitely. \n \n"It is not frustrating at all but there is a lot that you have got to think about over that period of time. It is an important couple of weeks but I am in a good place." \n \nLast year, Button's future was dragged out until the end of the season with McLaren not announcing their driver line-up until December. \n   Promoted stories   \nBut the 2009 world champion, who has ruled out a move to the newly-formed American outfit Haas, is confident a repeat scenario will be avoided this term. \n \n"It is a massive difference to last year and I think everyone has learnt from that being a bit of a mess," Button added. \n \n"I am very happy with what I have done this year and I think the team are as well. It is not what you may think." \n \nButton has endured a testing season with McLaren as the British team's renewed relationship with Honda has failed to take off. But the 35-year-old is optimistic that their partnership with Honda will deliver the goods in the long term. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"If I am in F1 it will be with this team," he added. "I have had some tough times with this team but I have a lot of respect for them and for Honda. \n \n"I think this team is for the future and I do not think there is any point looking at a smaller start-up programme. This team is very young still in terms of our relationship with Honda. This will improve a lot over the years, it just depends on how long."

The assumed targets for the extension include employees of their overseas companies transferred to their Japanese branches and foreign nationals who have highly specialized skills in information technology, according to Nikkei. \n \nThe government extended the maximum visa period from three years to five in 2012. \n \nThe draft aims to encourage married women to go out and work by revising the current system of allowances available to spouses who earn less than ¥1.3 million annually, because the limit is thought to discourage women from working to their maximum potential. Similarly, the current old-age pension system, whose payouts decline as wage earnings increase, is also targeted for revision in the draft, the Nikkei said

0379_488647cc-cc0a-47e1-8ca5-456060c26b77	Fowler, Karen Joy "The Jane Austen Book Club" - 2004\nI'm reading this with an ad hoc online book club a friend started to read this and Jane Austen's books. Since I just reread all of them, I am refering you to the link here for my reviews of them.\nI'm afraid this book does not give Jane Austen any credit. The book club is like many of the clubs my friends have told me about - and I once briefly was a member of one, too, but left it rather quickly since I would love to talk about the books we read, not gossip about everything but books. The sticker on the cover "Richard & Judy's Book Club" should have rung huge bells. I will let that be a warning to me.\nDo they ever talk about the books? Has Karen Joy Fowler even read any of them? If she did, she doesn't know how to talk about a book because I am under the impression she hasn't even opened any of these fabulous novels. Why else would she construct a story around Jane Austen without even getting into her writings?\nA disappointing read. I only finished it so we can talk about it in our little group.\nFrom the back cover: "In California's Sacramento Valley, six people meet once a month to discuss Jane Austen's novels. They are ordinary people, neither happy nor unhappy, but all wounded in different ways, all mixed up about their lives and their relationships. Over the six months they meet marriages are tested, affairs begin, unsuitable arrangements become suitable, and, under the guiding eye of Jane Austen, some of them even fall in love . . ."\nThere were, however, some other books mentioned in the book, apart from all the Jane Austen novels:\nHenlein, Robert A. "Stranger in a Strange Land"\nJunger, Sebastian "The Perfect Storm"\nLeGuin, Urusla K. "The Left Hand of Darkness"\nLeGuin, Ursula K "The Lathe of Heaven"\nLeGuin, Urusla K. "Searoad"\nRadcliffe, Ann "The Mysteries of Udolpho"\nRand, Ayn "The Fountainhead"\nTolkien, J.R.R. "The Lord of the Rings"

Those who get really into fancy dress, and those who sweat with fear over those two dreaded words. \n \nAnd David Beckham is certainly in the first camp, as he shared a photo of him looking like Freddie Mercury , along with two of his buddies. \n \nRelated: Put down the scissors Victoria Beckham! David has banned her from cutting Harper’s hair \n \nREAD MORE CELEBRITY NEWS \n \nThankfully, all our favourite celebs seem to follow in Becks’ footsteps and love putting on a costume and even slapping some make-up or donning the occasional web, just as much as we do! \n \nSo here are some of the best celebrity fancy dress costumes we’ve ever laid eyes on… \n \n1.) David Beckham as Freddie Mercury \n We’re giving Becks 10 out of 10 for his effort of the Queen lead singer. We had to take a double take over the moustache and epic raised eyebrow! Oh, and he was uber sweet as he captioned the pic gushing about how much he was missing his family: ‘Can’t wait to get home to see my beautiful wife and unbelievable children.’ N’awww. \n \n2.) Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton as Ab Fab \n For a special edition of Celebrity Juice our favourite female duo telly dressed up as our other favourite female duo of all-time. It was so spot-one it was almost like looking into the future – we can 100% see best friends Fearne and Holly growing old together and transforming into Absolutely Fabulous ’ Patsy and Eddy. \n 3.) Kate Moss as Cara Delevingne \n They’ve done campaigns together, sat on the front row of Fashion Week together, and even shoot photos of each other in a sexy photoshoot, so there’s no mistaking that these two supermodels love one another. But it like model-ception as Kate Moss donned a slogan t-shirt and stuck out that iconic Cara Delevingne tongue – you know what they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! \n \n4.) Nick Grimshaw as Lily Allen \n It’s not often we see ol’ Grimmy out of his standard skinny black jeans and wacky fun shirt combo. But when he switched his style up a bit, we didn’t expect to see him looking like THIS. Paying homage to his mate Lily Allen – Rememnber? When she used to wear poufy ballgowns with high top trainers? – we can’t stop laughing at this fancy dress option. Oh Nick, you do always manage to make us LOL. \n \n5.) Rochelle Humes as Princess Jasmine \n \nIn case you’re wondering if Disney Princesses actually do exist (they definitely do btw), then look no further than The Saturdays ’ Rochelle Humes , who looked liked the perfect princess when she dressed up as Jasmine from Aladdin . She was even joined by her animated mates Prince Charming in the form of One Direction ‘s Niall Horan , and of course her very own prince, Aladdin as dressed up by hubby Marvin Humes . \n 6.) Charlotte Crosby as Cheryl \n Why ay man! From one Geordie lass to another, when Charlotte Crosby put on THAT soldier outfit from Cheryl ’s Fight For This Love video, we couldn’t help but feel all partiotric and stuff at the Newcastle solidarity shown. Oh, and the fact that she looked just as bangin’ as our Chezza did – looking good girls! \n \n \nRight, we’re getting our next fancy dress thinking caps on ready for the next party! \n \nThink Nick Grimshaw looks different as Lily Allen? SEE how much he’s changed over the years… \n \nWatch video \n \nAmy Lo \n \nThe post appeared first on Now magazine .

0384_2be3af3e-e476-4b77-b608-619a8273541a	Bernie’s Agenda: ’Democratic-Capitalism,’ Not Old World ‘Socialism’ Bernie Sanders, by any classic measure, is a lousy socialist who should jettison this inflammatory, injurious misnomer. Does embracing “socialism” — an open-ended, domestic land mine — not cloud his brilliant career, his surging national esteem and jaw-dropping campaign success? If winning the nomination is the prize, then why deliver a flaming torch to every scornful interviewer, partisan Republican, or Hillary defender so they can light up the night sky with painful distortions? Does Sanders talk up nationalizing major industries? Top-down, centralized economic control? Widespread price controls, suspicion of private property, even sanctified Five Year Plans? That’s what vast numbers of voters, let alone political scientists, think of as “socialism.” For this pragmatic progressive, time the Sanders’ team reconsiders a self-induced obstacle between him and a stunning primary upset that would rock our political foundations. Plus, igniting my model for a progressive era that must last a generation or more to equal the first Progressive Era.  Curiously, when activist Burlington mayor, Sanders didn’t push “socializing” city utilities, though he achieved “community trust housing” and fought intrusive cable price hikes and bad lakefront development. Not exactly splashy “democratic socialism.” I posit more traction if he embraced his first allegiance, the Liberty Union Party. Let’s face it: anything that reeks of “socialism” communes on these shores of denial and ignorance with communism, inviting knee-jerk tar and feathering by jerks. And most significantly, without upsides that expand popularity. How many socialist voters — Scandinavian or otherwise, per Bernie’s praise — will decide our dozen key battleground states? What overt “socialist” candidate has wowed Democratic voters since noble figures, Eugene Debs and Norman Thomas, made news long, long ago? Nationally, in ’12, under 5000 voted “socialist.” Socialism, the Shrinking US Cult Frankly, rightwing extremism sells better in polling: look how well the Trumpster does with proto-fascist rants. Would Trumpery not wither if he depicted his immigration wall folly as a perpetual, socialist-monopoly boondoggle, marrying private industries and top-down federalism to serve Tea Party fantasies? Is not his entire anti-immigrant package a bizarre way to empower the state to “socialize” primitive values,  keeping the US as white as long as possible? Makes the federalized “socialism” of public schooling or Medicare look tame. I make a point here solely about nomenclature as this is certainly not Sanders’, nor my own, positive view of humane European socialism. I appreciate the senator’s loyalty to this mavericky term that fuels fierceness against the corporate billionaire class, blindly equating socialism with infamy. I get the logic for a breakthrough candidate to redeem a tarnished phrase to widen his appeal, talking up when government works. Good candidates define themselves first and clearly, before foes with millions slice and dice “who he really is.” Yet, why offer up, as if deeply revealing, a negative word that misrepresents Sanders’ own potent agenda? On point, where’s the core socialism behind Sanders’ insistence that bloated billionaires pay their fair share and not dictate government elections? Eisenhower and others did that by refusing to change the top tax of 90%, warning about the military-industrial complex, and enacting campaign funding limits. Does Bernie’s socialism ever condemn the goal of making money — or instead criticize how rigged courts and Congress produce gaping loopholes that make dangerous billionaire concentrations inevitable? There’s nothing socialistic about dressing down the self-absorbed rich who think they should run everything. Jefferson, then progressives a century later, warned fiercely about the evils of ruthless corporatism. Has Sanders ever condemned the sanctity of private property or pushed for Washington to commandeer major industries? Not that I’ve heard. Demanding universal health care, with strictly regulated prices, closes down no corporate health providers—- only humanizes them to act like profitable public utilities? How many corporate giants go bankrupt serving Medicare? What, No President Ideology? What Sanders underestimates is how greatly Yanks hate ideology, especially imported systems from the repellent, tainted Old World. Only the horror of communism outpoints socialism in this hall of shame — and for Republicans a “slam-dunk” cudgel against Democrats, with Obama laughably slammed for “socialism” that pays off slavish minorities. Winning candidates shy away from rigid, systemic abstractions that offend one group without predictable offsets, across history and political parties.  Sure, visions, triumphs and empty pledges work, but not rigid fixations or ideological rectitude. Sanders after all is anything but an ideologue, socialist or otherwise — and less of a “democratic socialist” than a “democratic capitalist.” Like FDR, Sanders’ agenda will redeem, even rationalize tarnished capitalism.  Does he preach the end of capitalism, even so far drastic systemic changes? Does Sanders impugn GDP except when producing too much pollution from fossil fuels, thus HIS top environmental solutions? Does Sanders not still boast of the slice of the job-producing military-industrial complex he escorted to Vermont? Even his challenge to dubious WS bailouts, shielding “too big to fail” banks, keeps Sanders in the capitalistic camp, reinforced by his industry-serving jobs programs, infrastructure projects, and sensible trade notions. No president is electable by assailing the present economic system, awarded nearly religious reverence. Certainly, let’s reinstate Glass-Steagall, but if that’s ardent socialism, I’ll eat my progressive hat.  Frankly, I can’t find one Sanders proposal that smacks of classic socialism. Take free college education: no threat to capitalism, even profit-driven schools; it’s mainly about who pays the tab, not that Washington dictate policy for higher education. Sanders Echoes FDR, not Debs Not only is Sanders not much of a socialist but, like FDR, embraces an agenda that lifts the capital-depleted middle-class and raises wages to boost consumer spending, likely to save today’s worst-case version of crony capitalism from itself. In fact, to find the best examples of bad, recent “corporate” socialism, look no further than Dubya’s corrupt TARP bank bailouts or Obama’s loans that saved General Motors. Years ago in Vermont Sanders got re-elected by calling himself a “democratic-socialist.” Bully for old times. But craven sound bites and catch phrases now dominate the national political stage. I question whether “socialism,” with its historic, negative connotations, is not a hard-to-defend, risky ploy, especially when winning over less informed and unaligned moderates in ley battleground states. Finally, I dread what the vast, overheated, irrational right-wing conspiracy will do with a curse second in smear value to communism. Since Birtherism lasted far, far more than the fifteen minutes of infamy it deserved . . . and if the right can turn the nothing-burger of Benghazi into months of harangue . . . if anti-immigration bigotry tops early GOP polling, just imagine and tremble. On a lighter note, Sanders might take a leaf from Karl Rove: if not “democratic-capitalist,” how about “compassionate, American-born socialism”? Okay, why not “compassionate capitalism?” That phrase, alas, has a major practical downside: skeptical Sanders’ millions are more likely to fall down laughing, in stitches, so long they miss getting to the voting booth.

0385_35f260e2-2331-40ce-a9eb-2058143d0420	P. Stobdan September 18, 2015 On September 9, geopolitics unexpectedly hit the news headlines when Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov made an important statement about the ongoing talks between Moscow and Islamabad on the delivery of Russian multirole Mi-35M attack helicopters and the latest Su-35 fighter jets. Ryabkov said Pakistan is Russia's “closest partner” and the ties between the two countries are evolving beyond the military sphere to include other sectors such as energy. At the same time, he also suggested that this will not have a negative impact on relations between Moscow and New Delhi. Coming from a top Russian official, these statements cannot be considered as a mere kite flying stunt by the Russian media. Such a tectonic strategic shift may not have come as a pleasant news to Indian ears, but before we react to this startling change in the Russian position, it is important to first understand the deeper and nuanced aspects of Russia’s motives. Interestingly, within days of Ryabkov’s statement, a prominent Russian political analyst Andrew Korybko provocatively detailed why Pakistan is gaining pivotal importance in the Russian geo-strategic calculus. The article, titled “Pakistan is the “Zipper” of Pan-Eurasian Integration”, appeared on 15 September on the website of the Russian government funded think-tank – Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISS) established by the President of the Russian Federation. The RISS puts up policy papers to the President’s office, the Federation Council, the State Duma and the Security Council as well as to Government offices, ministries and departments. (The RISS has closely interacted with IDSA in the past and the two institutions have signed a MoU for joint research. However, the Russian think-tank has not shown much interest for cooperation with IDSA in the past few years). As a keen watcher of Eurasian affairs, I thought it is important to share the significant points articulated by Andrew Korybko in his rather astounding article so that the Indian strategic community can understand the new thinking among informed Russian circles. In Part I of his article, Korybko deals with the ‘zipper’ concept of how Pakistan can draw together four of Eurasia’s most prominent economic entities, and examines the key imperatives for Russia to build a strong Strategic Partnership with Pakistan. In Part II, he does crystal gazing on the most probable ways in which the US can attempt to offset everything or derail Pakistan’s future destiny of joining the Eurasian integration process. Korbyko’s article begins by saying that contrary to popular myth about Pakistan as a “backward land of terrorism and poverty” that carries little actual weight, the West purposefully neglects the country’s rising geopolitical importance in Eurasia and its potential to connect the massive economies of the Eurasian Union, Iran, SAARC, and China to create an integrated pan-Eurasian economic zone. The article then elaborates why Russia recognises Pakistan’s prime geopolitical potential and how it is manoeuvring to speed up the development of full-spectrum relations with this “South Asian gatekeeper.” It says that Russia’s overarching goal is to provide a “non-provocative balancing component to bolster Pakistan’s regional political position and assist with its peaceful integration into the multi-polar Eurasian framework being constructed by the Sino-Russian Strategic Partnership.” Interestingly, it draws attention to China’s grand vision of building a trans-Pakistani trade corridor under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which could be a catalyst for connecting the four economic blocs together. This includes linking of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) with SAARC intersecting at the Xinjiang-Pakistan junction to be developed under the CPEC. From the Russian perspective, the article suggests, the CPEC not only represents a “geopolitical pivot for China, but also a geo-economic one”, for “it’ll position the country within easy access to the Mideast oil fields”. This is the only way China will be able to quell the “externally orchestrated destabilization that it’s lately found itself experiencing in Xinjiang.” It stresses the importance of the Iran-Pakistan-China pipeline project (a part of the CPEC) becoming a reality and suggests that “should Xinjiang succeed in becoming a significant Eurasian trading hub in connecting China, Eurasian Union, SAARC, and Iran, then it would catapult in geo-economic significance to become an ultra-strategic Heartland region.” On the prospect of India joining the Eurasian system, Korbyko’s article says that the touchy issue of India’s claim over “Pakistan-administered Kashmir” could come in the way. However, “if Indian companies employ this route, the economic allure might be too tempting to resist.” Further, if Indo-Pak differences could be relaxed (perhaps within the SCO framework), then “the organization would finally be able to cash in on its economic capability and fully integrate with itself and the rest of Eurasia.” Importantly, the article discloses how Russia’s strategic ties with Pakistan are moving towards very “exciting future possibilities” despite Russia being “India’s closest friend”. It notes that the emerging trend might appear somewhat “perplexing” but it isn’t all that “unexpected.” Because, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent emergence of South Asian “nuclear bipolarity” have reduced the intensity of Indo-Russian strategic ties as well as America’s dealings with Pakistan. These shifts in focus (India’s westward and Pakistan’s eastward) do not, however, suggest that either India or Pakistan has completely deserted its erstwhile partner; only that they are seeking adjustments to protect their national interest in the changed context. But at the same time, these shifts in focus have not yet altered the Indo-Pak standoff. In this context, the article notes, both India and Pakistan seem to be willing to give multilateralism under Eurasia a chance, as evident from their entry into the SCO. More interestingly, the author points to the Kremlin’s calculation of its ability to intermediate between Beijing and New Delhi in the event of a major India-China crisis. But he also says that Russia does not enjoy the same leverage to do so in an India-Pakistan conflict situation. As a result, in the latter situation, Moscow would prefer to “push the US into the mix – giving it plenty of opportunity to divide and conquer according to the present geopolitical circumstances.” Korybko then goes to point out that “if Russia were to compensate for its diplomatic ‘blind spot’ with Pakistan and reinvigorate the bilateral relationship with Islamabad, then it could mirror the role that it plays between India and China in also helping to balance the tension between India and Pakistan.” This strategy, the article argues, would eventually “push the US out of the playing field, though India will still retain its current level of ties with the US but not for the purpose counterbalancing Pakistan.” It suggests that both India and Pakistan would then rather rely on their same “trusted partner Russia”, which for its part will be able to mediate between the two (like it does with India and China). The article admits to the trust deficit between India and Pakistan as the weakest link in the ‘zipper’ vision, though the vision could still succeed without the SAARC component because the “EEU would gain by India’s physical incorporation into the unified Eurasian infrastructural framework.” Korybko also points to Russian diplomatic and strategic competence being capable of minimizing Indo-Pak discord and exploring the economic benefit of their peaceful collaboration. The Russian analyst then explains how Russia made the first strategic move in this regard in June 2014 by offering to sell attack helicopters to Pakistan for the latter’s drug-combating efforts. Though the “paradigm shift” was attributed by many to Russia’s concerns over post-2014 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan, the main idea was to initiate the process of depolarisation in India-Pakistan tensions and to make the multi-polar concept more cohesive as a result. The article says that Russia’s next move would be to help Pakistan with technical expertise for building a portion of the Iran-Pakistan-China gas pipeline in the near future. According to the write up, Pakistan’s own excitement has increased after sensing the enormous economic opportunities that will unfold after CPEC completion. Pakistanis could see the “writing on the wall” and even contemplate sealing a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Union. This signifies how seriously Russia takes its evolving partnership with Pakistan. The article underlines how the relationship is also gaining a soft power touch, with both sides preparing for their first-ever cultural exchange year. In a symbolic significance of what is likely to come, the article says that “Pakistan’s national military band performed at the Moscow International Music Festival.” The article notes that “there should thus be no doubt at this point about the commitment of both sides for deepening the relationship as the ongoing interactions between the two are beyond passing convergence of business interests.” It further says that “Both sides understand the larger significance of what they’re doing”, which is to work for the “shared vision of an integrated and multi-polar Eurasia.” However, on the down side and for the Eurasian enterprise to succeed, the author anticipates that CPEC and the ‘zipper’ plan could face a major blow either due to instability within Pakistan or India’s possible refusal to participate in it. Interestingly, the article notes that any possibility of all-round Russia-Pakistan engagement could speed up Indo-US proximity which, in turn, will lead to provocation by the “US and its information proxies”. Things could also be exacerbated by an exaggerated “Indian threat assessment of Russia’s activities.” Any Indian paranoia over Russia’s ‘sliding away’ to join the China-Pakistan ‘axis’ would consequently negate the main reasons behind the Russian-Pakistan strategic partnership, which is to “place Moscow in a position to intermediate between New Delhi and Islamabad and keep regional relations stable enough so as to jump start the envisioned multilateral economic partnership.” The author, however, argues that Russia’s Pakistan gambit might fail most likely because of the United States playing dirty. In such a scenario, Russia would be worse off and risk losing a major strategic partner in India. Pakistan, on the other hand, will “never see its relation with Russia as equal level to one it has with China.” The article cautions that Russia needs to proceed delicately taking into consideration how the Indian establishment views Russia’s evolving ties with Pakistan. It does not discount the ability of the US to split Russia and India through Pakistan, like it did with Russia and the European Union through Ukraine (although for different reasons). The author fears the possibility of the US creating a rift through “information warfare” especially when Indo-US defence ties are deepening. He notes that this could have in a way “possibly played a part in influencing Moscow’s decision to resume arms exports to Pakistan.” The article draws attention to the saliency of “underreported military development” that makes the US more integral to India’s national security, and this it says coincides with New Delhi’s strategic overlap with the US in containing China. “The longer this progresses, the further the US will embed itself into India’s deep state apparatus, with all of the unfortunate foreign policy consequences for the multi-polar world” the article notes. The writer then dwells on the personal rapport shared between Modi and Obama and other aspects of the Indo-US friendship which, he thinks, could be an “exaggerated charade for political purposes, there’s nothing tangible to indicate that this is the case” and by itself doesn’t pose any worries for Russia.” But what really worries Russia is the possibility of Obama leveraging his friendship with Modi to “enact certain policy shifts”, such as “his encouragement to India’s Act East policy for unstated reason that can aggravate relations with China.” According to Korybko, Russian interests would be most endangered by the “US winning over India into viewing the Russian-Pakistan strategic partnership as a threat” and suggests that Putin should “continually reinforce his relationship with Modi so that the latter is insusceptible to being tricked by Obama into doubting the Russian President’s intentions.”(It is pertinent to note here that in his congratulatory message to Prime Minister Modi on his 65th birthday, issued by the Kremlin on September 17, President Putin praised how the Prime Minister rightly enjoys high international authority both in his homeland and abroad as a proficient politician and statesman. The message says “we highly appreciate your efforts to strengthen the special and privileged strategic partnership between our countries, develop Russian-Indian interaction in solving topical issues of the regional and global agenda.”)  Further, the article points to the likelihood of American involvement in creating instability in Baluchistan. Baluch separatism driven by American interests is not just for destabilising Gwadar (the source of CPEC) or for the political fragmentation of Pakistan but to create a new geopolitical space to be carved out of the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan as well. Such a Baluch proxy, it says, could provide the US with a greater degree of influence over both Iran and India in controlling trans-regional transport connectivity. Of course, the author cites the Pentagon’s foremost author Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters’ infamous map Blood Borders: How a Better Middle East Would Look, which specifically earmarks a “Free Baluchistan” carved out of Iranian and Pakistani territory. Korybko then moves beyond the Baluch separatist scenario to highlight the presence of militant Islamic radicalism in FATA – the most important destabilising factor in Pakistan. To add to that he draws attention to the rise of ISIL and its “expansive neo-Caliphate ideology” in Afghanistan’s three provinces of Farah (west), Helmand (south), and Nangarhar (east). The ISIL, he says, could use Nangarhar province as a staging ground for pushing deeper into Pakistan by eliminating the Durand Line and “annex” the ‘state of Hind’ (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar). Further, Korybko also says that if more “Taliban fighters defect to the up-and-coming group” a scenario of a birth of a “transnational ‘mini-Caliphate’ between Nangarhar and parts of FATA would evoke the shades of ISIL’s prior successes along the Syrian-Iraqi border.” Not just that, the article vividly points to how ISIL is also moving in the northern direction, citing the defection in May of Colonel Gulmurod Khalimov, the head of Tajikistan’s Internal Special Forces, to ISIL. It hints at the possibility of ISIL gaining invaluable intelligence and employing Khalimov’s knowledge in infiltrating into the most ‘ideal’ location in Gorno-Badakhstan region. If this occurs concurrently, the article suggests, the “US then would be keen, among other things, to take revenge for Kyrgyzstan denouncing its cooperation agreement with the US.” Therefore, the article does not rule out the possibility of a quadrilateral South-Central Asian Caliphate emerging in “heavily fortified Pamir and Hindu Kush mountain ranges, with Pakistan being the southern peg of this vile construction.” The article paints another disruptive scenario of how the US could derail Pakistan’s geo-economic destiny by engineering a possible “Colour Revolution against Prime Minister Sharif or any of his successors”, although it also says that the violent protests last year did not pan out as a doom and gloom scenario for Pakistan. Korybko does not foretell the exact contours of the follow-up disruptive attempt, but says that with the “improved political technology available” it might likely embrace “anti-corruption” slogans led by an amorphous and superficially apolitical “civil society” in Pakistan. Such a structural innovation, the article suggests, would “allow the coup’s leaders to readjust their social infrastructure (leadership, members, slogans, etc.) on the fly a lot more efficiently than if they followed the comparatively rigid practices of their predecessors in organizing the event around clearly defined political parties led by a few well-known (and easily compromised) individuals.” This scenario to be deployed in Pakistan would be “Colour Revolution 1.5”. The article notes that this will be halfway between the comparatively ‘docile’ 2003 Colour Revolution 1.0 in Georgia and the “out-of-control Hybrid War mayhem of Colour Revolution 2.0 in EuroMaidan.” Colour Revolution 1.5 in Pakistan could go either way, “towards 1.0 if it sputters out like in Armenia or towards 2.0 if it dangerously intensifies like it did in Syria.” The article says that 1.5 could become a dangerous innovation to “regime change strategy” and that the US would be committed to apply it first with smaller targets before being “perfected and repackaged to Pakistan.” The article argues that Moscow has rightly taken the “bold step in reaching out to Islamabad and soliciting a strategic partnership” and the quick pace of the partnership taking a revolutionary shape is a “natural fit for both partners.” But this trend, according to the article, has incited the US’ “geopolitical jealousy”, which is keen to call upon a “mixed bag of secessionist, terrorist, and Colour Revolution destabilizations to offset Pakistan’s catalytic role in bringing Eurasia together.” The author then calls upon Russia, China, and Iran to defeat the threat so that Pakistan can become Eurasia’s economic ‘zipper’ and linking these (and perhaps even SAARC’s) economies together in an emboldened multi-polar future. The article concludes by saying that the EU is mistakenly staying out (due to US pressure) of this trans-Eurasian integration process, which is becoming the primary theme of the 21st century. But “the rest of the main continental economic powers – the Eurasian Union, Iran, SAARC, and China – stand poised for closer integration with one another owing to the infrastructural overlap that Pakistan’s geostrategic location provides.” The central theme of Korbyko’s article is to highlight the pivotal importance of Pakistan and the Russian eagerness to build a foundation of political trust with the Pakistani leadership so as to better assist in the management of Pakistani-Indian tensions. To be sure, Pakistan can certainly help Russia shift its focus away from its current difficulties but Moscow should be doubly careful whether Pakistan will not become a staging ground to break up Russia further. The Americans have already tested the Pakistani betrayal, and China too sooner or later will become another victim of Pakistani treachery. Surely, the Russians have always displayed enthusiasm for mediation between India and Pakistan, but Moscow would do well to remind itself of its failure to achieve success in the mid-1960s. I will leave the interpretation and analysis of this important article to the readers.

Obstacles are always put in the way." \n\n\n\n \nThey reveal they wanted their characters to get together as much as fans did. \n\nLogan addresses the fact that their on-screen relationship also addresses and tackles other issues. \n\n"Viewers have grown up with these characters," she says, "Love and sex - it's not just for youngsters! It's nice to think there's still an interest in these old fuddy-duddies. They're not dead from the neck down the minute they turn 50." \n\nHer and Carter, along with the rest of the cast, shed many tears on the last day of filming which was August 12. \n\n\t\t\t \nTalking about Fellowes' narrative and how the show deals with "big issues", Carter says: " He was clever to set it when he did, in a period of big social change. There were some areas where you couldn't go too deeply. If a black jazz singer had arrived in north Yorkshire in the 1920s, folk would have fainted, screamed or called the police!" \n\nFor Logan though, parts of the storyline are close to home: " Mine was a very working-class background. I grew up knowing about 'haves and have-nots'. But the Granthams are a very benign lot - not everyone was like that - some were quite dreadful to their employees. But I'm not sure how Downton would've played if it had been harder." \n\nCarter reveals his last line in the final series, and it's sure to keep fans guessing as to its hidden meaning. \n\nHe says: "My last line goes something like this: "It's going to be a different life, but we'll manage... together'." \n\n\t\t\t \n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

0388_eee6c366-6cb2-44c6-9f86-20be63e25a1c	One of the essential tasks of a major league manager is to come up with different things to say about the same phenomena. Every team navigates 162 games in 182 days with mostly the same players on the field, and mostly the same reporters generating questions, and only two possible outcomes at stake in each game. Win or lose, the manager must talk. \n\nAt some point this year, Don Mattingly gave up. He’d run out of superlatives to describe Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, to the point where the Dodgers manager now freely admits this before dutifully rattling off a few things that make each pitcher special when he’s asked. Mattingly is asked about Kershaw and Greinke a lot. \n  \nIt happened again last week. Mattingly decided to remove Kershaw five innings into his most recent start, Thursday against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Dodgers were trailing 3-0 at the time. Kershaw didn’t have his best stuff but he fought to stay in the game, yelling at Mattingly in the dugout to no avail. \n\nThe next day, Mattingly was asked about the incident. His response was familiar: “Clayton’s awesome. Clayton’s the last of my worries.” \n\nIt isn’t just the manager. Two Dodgers players have written online essays since the season began, Brandon McCarthy for ESPN.com and A.J. Ellis for the Players’ Tribune . Each of them wrote about the same thing: Playing with Kershaw and Greinke. \n  \nThe numbers the two pitchers have compiled this season, and the praise garnered wherever they pitch, tell the same story: 2015 marks a historic convergence of two of the best at their craft. \n\n“They’re probably – well not probably,” Colorado Rockies outfielder Carlos Gonzalez said. “They are the best left-handed and right-handed pitcher in the game right now.” \nMoments \nThe author David Foster Wallace once used the phrase “Federer moments” to describe Roger Federer’s awe-inducing strokes on a tennis court. There are certainly Greinke Moments and Kershaw Moments too, and opposing hitters recognize them right away. \n  \nArizona Diamondbacks catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia has two hits in 13 plate appearances against Greinke in his career. He’s also struck out five times. \n\n“At our place he threw me a 3-1 changeup,” Saltalamacchia recalled, shaking his head. “Not many guys throw me a 3-1 changeup. Then he backs me up with another one and I roll over on it.” \n\nSeveral hitters, including Saltalamacchia, described Greinke as “thinking along with” him at the plate. One was Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado, whose 41 home runs and 126 runs batted in are among the most in baseball. Arenado has five hits in 24 creer at-bats against Greinke, a .208 average. \n \n \n  \n“I feel he knows exactly what I’m thinking,” Arenado said of Greinke. “I’m thinking a certain part of the plate, he throws the opposite. I’m looking for a certain pitch, he throws the opposite.” \n\nGreinke Moments are usually subtle, a byproduct of extensive homework, guile and precision with five different pitches. Kershaw Moments are more obvious. \n\nKershaw has the only no-hitter between the two, which he threw against the Rockies in June 2014. Kershaw has mastered the skill of snagging ground balls on his backhand, with his body turned away from home plate. His windup is deliberate and exaggerated, with a pronounced leg kick that effectively disrupts a hitter’s timing. \n  \nWith a fastball that touches 96 mph and a slider that’s actually gotten faster -- it regularly exceeds 90 mph now – Kershaw fits the definition of a power pitcher. Eighty-two percent of his pitches this season have been a fastball or slider; the other 18 percent are almost entirely curveballs. \n\n“He’s been that since the get-go,” Arizona Diamondbacks infielder Aaron Hill said. “He’s got that mid-90s heater. He throws it where he wants to. He’s been doing that five, six, seven years. It’s rare to find a guy who comes up in the first couple years and is effective with his heater.” \n  \nKershaw’s 281 strikeouts are the most since another power-armed lefty, Randy Johnson, struck out 290 in 2004. \n\nLike Greinke, who could blow away hitters with a 99-mph fastball early in his career, Kershaw’s approach is becoming more sophisticated. That’s particularly true for his curveball. \n\n“Early in his career,” Ellis said, “it was ‘I’m going to throw a curveball and whatever happens, happens.’ He’s going to throw a good one, but there was no difference between his 1-1 curveball and his 1-2 curveball. Whereas now I’ll call for a 1-1 curveball and he’ll throw it a little bit higher, maybe the bottom of the strike zone, the guy will take it for a strike or put a bad swing on it. With two strikes, he definitely wants a swing-and-miss on it. He’ll throw it a little bit lower. \n  \n“He’s gotten to another level because of that ability.” \nNumbers \nAnd yet, it’s Greinke who has taken his results to another level this season. \n\nHis 1.65 earned-run average is 56 percent better than the league average. Only four pitchers have outperformed the league average more in a single season since the end of World War II. Even Greinke’s 2009 season, when he was chucking 99-mph heaters en route to his first and only Cy Young Award, falls short of his 2015 season by this measure. \n\nGreinke also leads the major leagues in winning percentage (18-3, .857) and WHIP (0.848). Traditional pitching statistics, the backbone of Cy Young Award voting since the award was invented, all present a strong case for Greinke. \n  \nKershaw is the reigning National League MVP and Cy Young Award winner. Asked recently about this year’s Cy race, Kershaw said , “I don’t think Zack has too much to worry about.” \n\nTo Gonzalez’s point, maybe they are the best lefty and righty in baseball. \n\nAdvanced statistics like FIP and xFIP, which attempt to eliminate the impact the defense has on a pitcher, rate Kershaw has the best pitcher in baseball this year, right or left-handed. So does FanGraphs’ version of Wins Above Replacement. \n\nKershaw and Greinke have compiled the highest combined WAR of any two teammates (13.4) this season. By this measure, the two aren’t merely chasing the great duos in Dodger history. They’re entering the echelon of Johnson and Curt Schilling, whose combined WAR in 2002 (17.5) and 2001 (16.9) for the Arizona Diamondbacks rank number first and second, respectively, over the last 60 years. \n  Parallels \nBob Brenly managed Johnson and Schilling from 2001-03, when both pitchers were at the peak of their powers. They led the Diamondbacks to their only championship in 2001, sharing the World Series MVP award. \n\n“We wanted to get those two guys on the mound as often as we could,” Brenly said. “Until the division was clinched and you could maybe space out their workload, we ran ‘em out there on a regular schedule. Both guys were slaves to their routine. They wanted to pitch on four days of rest in between and didn’t like to change that.” \n  \nThe similarities between the two tandems outweigh the differences. Johnson threw left-handed, Schilling right. Johnson had the power pitcher’s repertoire, while Schilling relied more on his ability to out-smart hitters to compensate for a lack of velocity. \n\n“The one thing that made the tandem more effective was the competition between the two of them,” Brenly said. “Randy, at that stage of his career, had earned a certain status in the game. Curt was on his way to doing that but wasn’t quite at the same level as far as reputation in the game. I think sometimes that rubbed Randy the wrong way. I think sometimes that pushed Curt to be even better, because the two of them wanted to be on equal ground and neither guy wanted the other to be on equal ground. \n  \n“It was a great situation for us.” \n\nSo it is for the Dodgers today. \n\nWriting for ESPN.com, McCarthy recalled a moment in spring training when Greinke threw particularly well on a back field at Camelback Ranch. “If I throw like that this year,” Greinke told McCarthy that day, “Kersh better watch out.” \n\nMcCarthy said that, among teammates, neither Greinke nor Kershaw has verbally expressed a desire to one-up the other since then. Occasionally a reporter will ask the pitchers if a friendly competition exists, but neither has been willing to admit it so far. \n  \n“I would assume there’s a competitive aspect whether or not it’s ever vocalized,” McCarthy said. \n\nMaybe what Kershaw and Greinke are doing, then, isn’t purely independent of one another. \n\nKershaw is 27 and Greinke 31, an age when each should be close to his physical prime. It’s easy to compare Kershaw to a young Greinke and plot his evolution on a similar path, but you never know. Greinke is widely expected to opt out of his contract at the end of the season, so the window for the two men to nudge each other forward from adjoining lockers might close. \n  \nArizona Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, a perennial MVP candidate in his own right, said this competitive edge is what separates Kershaw and Greinke the most. \n\n“They have good command, they know how to pitch, but they’re able to take it to another level with how they compete out there,” Goldschmidt said. “Not that anyone ever wants to lose or give up a hit, but those guys kind of take it to the next level.”
0389_e3aa0223-249f-47e6-9ce4-08be42b573ef	Yesterday, during his remarks at the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama stated:\n"I’m confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore."\nObama is partly right.\nThe U.S. Congress will eventually lift the embargo -- but only upon the fulfillment of some very basic conditions in U.S. law.\nThese conditions are consistent with the democratic and human rights standards of 34 out of 35 nations in the Western Hemisphere.\n(Though, ironically, Venezuela continues on a downwards spiral away from these standards -- thanks in no small part to Cuba's manipulation of the Chavez/Maduro governments.)\nThus, the questions should be --\nWhy does Obama want the U.S. Congress to unilaterally discard any of these conditions?\nDoes Obama not agree with these conditions?\nWhich one of these conditions does Obama oppose?\nIs it, for example --\nThe condition that Cuba "legalizes all political activity"?\nThe condition that Cuba "releases all political prisoners and allows for investigations of Cuban prisons by appropriate international human rights organizations"?\nThe condition that Cuba "dissolves the present Department of State Security in the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, including the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution and the Rapid Response Brigades"?\nThe condition that Cuba "makes a public commitments to organizing free and fair elections for a new government"?\nThe condition that Cuba "makes public commitments to and is making demonstrable progress in establishing an independent judiciary; respecting internationally recognized human rights and basic freedoms as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Cuba is a signatory nation; allows the establishment of independent trade unions as set forth in conventions 87 and 98\nof the International Labor Organization, and allows the establishment of independent social,\neconomic, and political associations"?\nThe condition that Cuba give "adequate assurances that it will allow the speedy and efficient distribution of assistance to the Cuban people"?\nThe condition that Cuba is "effectively guaranteeing the rights of free speech and freedom of the press, including granting permits to privately owned media and telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba"?\nThe condition that Cuba is "assuring the right to private property"?\nThe condition that Cuba is "taking appropriate steps to return to United States citizens (and entities which are 50 percent or more beneficially owned by United States citizens) property taken by the Cuban Government from such citizens and entities on or after January 1, 1959, or to provide equitable compensation to such citizens and entities for such property"?\nThe condition that Cuba has "extradited or otherwise rendered to the United States all persons sought by the United States Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States"?\nLet's not speak of the embargo in vague terms.\nIf Obama is suggesting for Congress to unilaterally discard these conditions, then he should specifically state which ones he disagrees with -- and why.\nMoreover, Obama should explain how turning a blind-eye to these basic conditions in U.S. law would not send a horrible message to the Cuban people about the United States' priorities, nor have dramatic short- and long-term consequences for the behavior of other pseudo-authoritarians in the region.

0392_ea8d9c64-0922-4d5c-8574-5f0a07015561	Is analysts' luck about to run out? \n\nThree months into the 2015 analyst class and things are looking a little uncertain. Following the volatility in China over August, J.P. Morgan banking analysts are suddenly predicting that revenues will fall 19% at investment banks in the third quarter , Standard Chartered is dumping 25% of its senior staff  and clouds are gathering over Deutsche Bank ahead of its strategy update at the end of October. \n \nIt’s a shame given that it all started so well. The High Fliers UK graduate market report from January 2015 showed banking and finance firms hiking graduate recruitment by 21% in 2015 compared to 2014 (although investment banking intakes specifically increased by a more moderate 2.3%). “Most banks increased their graduate intakes this year,” says the head of HR at one international bank, speaking off the record. “It’s been a healthier year and deal-flow has been strong, so hiring more juniors sense.” \n \nIn the first half of 2015, global M&A reached $2.28 trillion, its second highest level on record. At Goldman Sachs, M&A revenues rose 62% year-on-year in the third quarter. In the circumstances, interns from summer 2015 say most of the investment banking classes received offers to join full time in summer 2016 and that banks are working hard to make sure they stay committed. “Virtually everyone in my class got an offer,” says one intern from a Swiss bank in New York. “They’ve also done a great job of continuing to sell the bank to us after the internship. And they threw a fantastic leaving party!” \n \nNonetheless, what goes up will probably come down again. The last time global M&A was this high was in 2007 – and we everyone knows what happened after that. Even before the events of late summer, some London-based recruiters were suggesting that M&A recruitment looked ‘toppy’.   J.P. Morgan’s analysts suggest deals are likely to be postponed if volatility continues, at which point banks could decide they’ve got more juniors than they need. \n \nAnalysts in fixed income and emerging markets may have to face the reality soonest. Nomura certainly hired several summer interns into its fixed income markets business, but we couldn’t find anyone among them who said they’d received a full time offer for 2016 after the bank made at least 60 of its London staff redundant.   \n \nNot everyone is pessimistic, however. Richard Hoar, director of banking and financial services at recruitment firm Goodman Masson, says demand for analysts and associates is back up to 2007 and that while there might be some “ups and downs”, there’s unlikely to be the sort of “fundamental collapse we saw during the credit crunch.” Similarly, the head of HR says banks are making more effort than ever before to keep analysts engaged: “Nowadays it’s all about making sure the quality of work we give to our graduates is high. – They want to be inspired and to see that they’re gaining skills and finding fulfillment.” \n \nEven so, some students are going into the industry with their eyes open. “The hours are brutal,” says one ex-intern who plans to join an IBD team in 2016. “You can’t help but wonder whether we’re just being employed as work horses to get banks through the next few years, with no prospect of advancing to VP or MD level.” \n \nFollow @MadameButcher

Many overlap but here they are in simple terms.MoneyThe ALP will struggle to get funds. The usual union donors will be trying to cope with legal bills and, in some cases, fines for appalling behaviour. And there are problems of declining membership. The fact that electoral defeat is almost certain will deter some business donors. The ALP membership will not be a strong source of funds due to declines in numbers, vitality and enthusiasm.Advertisement\nSome state ALP organisations are in very bad shape. In WA The Greens are raising roughly as much money as the ALP. Crisis is not far off.Meanwhile, money will not be a problem for the Liberal Party. Business and many rich individuals will provide all that is required and more.LeadershipPM Turnbull has taken charge of the nation without apparent effort and appears to have some sort of plan for creating a better future despite the many problems facing us all. Bill Shorten looks lost now that his only asset, Tony Abbott, has been removed.Not that it's all Bill Shortterm's fault. There are no leaders-in-waiting, just alternative faces.Turnbull has adopted a nice, rich uncle persona and is developing it with great skill. Shorten is more like a rather irritating brother-in-law. You can put up with him but find yourself wondering why your sister ever married him. You certainly don't want him around every day.Advertisement\nUnionsThe unions will continue to be a drag on the ALP as the Royal Commission produces more evidence of criminality and, more importantly, disrespect for workers.Beyond the specific stories will be the ongoing proof of the close relationship between the ALP and the union movement. For many young, and youngish, voters this is mystery as they have never had any real contact with unions and regard them as part of the pre-smartphone era, which to them is a dark incomprehensible void.Continued over the page...Pages:Page 123All Tweet Discuss in our Forums See what other readers are saying about this article!

0394_27eb5d52-ff0a-49b2-9d3f-0b84d5cdb6b7	READING reports about many Malaysians, especially young people, being declared bankrupt is both frightening and sad. These people do not realise that being declared a bankrupt is like being given a life sentence. \n \nEven though they are able to discharge themselves later, the record of their bankruptcy will still appear in the systems of the credit information and rating companies, and this can create obstacles to those who need to secure loans to buy property or to open a business. \n \nThe current economic situation warrants people to be careful in their financial commitments and expenditure. It is better to be careful now than to regret it later, especially among young people. \n \nI also hope for changes to be made in the conditions for declaring a person bankrupt. \n \nIn fact, the current figure of RM30,000 that would cause a debtor to be declared a bankrupt is too low to ruin a person’s life, especially a young one. \n \nI wonder when this figure was set. The amount should be higher in line with the current standard of living. \n \nIn Malaysia, unless you are able to pay off your debts or if the creditors are prepared to release you, you will remain a bankrupt for the rest of your life. \n \nMy wife’s friend was made a bankrupt together with her husband more than 35 years ago. Her husband passed away 30 years ago and until today she is still a bankrupt. She is required to seek permission from the bankruptcy office to travel overseas for holidays even though the expenses are paid by her children. \n \nShe applied for a discharge on many occasions but the creditors disagreed. She is 70 years old now and it looks like she will die a bankrupt. \n \nIf I am not mistaken, in Hong Kong, a bankrupt who has not previously been adjudged bankrupt and who has fully complied with the provisions under the Bankruptcy Ordinance, will be automatically discharged from bankruptcy four years from the date of the Bankruptcy Order provided that there is no objection from the creditors or the trustee. \n \nI hope the relevant authorities will review our bankruptcy laws to give former bankrupts the opportunity to rebuild their lives. \n \nThey should look at raising the amount of debt and length of time a person should be a bankrupt. \n \nAlso, once a person is discharged, all records pertaining to his bankruptcy must be erased. \n \nThe credit information and rating companies should not be allowed to include this information in their systems as this will cause unnecessary inconvenience and obstacles in the former bankrupt people’s efforts in rebuilding their lives. \n \nTHOMAS FOO \n \nSubang Jaya
0395_fd8f3343-1a89-4003-b62e-f1bfac87c034	SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/08/15 --  The global screenless display market size is expected to reach USD 5.59 billion by 2020, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. These devices came into progress during the year 2013 with the arrival of products such as virtual reality headsets, holographic videos, mobile phones for the elderly, retinal displays, bionic contact lenses, etc. \n\nProliferation of external monitors, reading devices and mobile phones with large screens serve as key enablers for the industry. As screenless display cost associated with procurement and deployment of the technology reduces, its application will witness exponential growth across industry verticals. Companies are investing in research and development to innovate products such as screenless computers, tablets, televisions and mobile phones. \n   \nBrowse full research report with TOC on "Screenless Display Market Analysis By Technology (Visual Image, Retinal Display, Synaptic Interface), By Application (Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Consumer Electronics) And Segment Forecasts To 2020" at: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/screenless-display-market  \n  \nScreenless displays offer an interactive projection technology developed to solve the issues related to device miniaturization of modern communication technologies. The lack of space in screen-based devices provides an opportunity for screenless display industry growth and development. High system cost may act as a growth restraint. \n\nFurther key findings from the study suggest: \nVisual image screenless display market is expected to dominate revenue over the forecast period, which can primarily be attributed to high demand for hologram technology. The limitation of conventional 3D displays is that the observer has no freedom of head movement or the freedom to increase information about the 3D objects being projected. Such limitations are overcome by holographic technology, which allow freedom of movement to the user. Consumer electronics accounted for over 40% of the overall revenue in 2014, and is expected to remain the largest application segment over the next few years. Virtual reality and augmented reality are upcoming fields wherein the technology finds considerable application. North America screenless display market is expected to remain the industry leader, primarily due to presence of key participants. Manufacturers are constantly developing and enhancing the technology to make it more sophisticated and to integrate it with consumer-grade devices. Google and Vuzix have aimed to increase adoption of smart wearable technology among consumers. Holographic video development is being carried out in MIT's Media Lab. Notable players involved in R&D include Avegant, Google, Kapsys, Displair, etc. Optical technology helps project images and data from computers or video players into the viewer's visual field. For instance, MicroVision's HMDs allow Army tank commanders to view the surrounding area from topside while simultaneously viewing a translucent map that floats a couple of feet away. This industry is characterized by M&A activities and strategic alliances to boost technology development. \nGrand View Research has segmented the global screenless display market on the basis of technology, application, and region: \nTechnology Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2013 - 2020) Visual Image Retinal Display Synaptic Interface Application Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2013 - 2020) Augmented Reality Virtual Reality Consumer Electronics Others Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2013 - 2020) North America Europe Asia Pacific RoW \nBrowse related reports by Grand View Research: \nElectronic Warfare Market - http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/electronic-warfare-market   \nHaptic Technology Market - http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/haptic-technology-market   \nManaged Services Market - http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/managed-services-market   \nE-Book Market - http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/e-book-market   \nAbout Grand View Research \n\nGrand View Research, Inc. is a U.S. based market research and consulting company, registered in the State of California and headquartered in San Francisco.

0396_772c281b-a7d8-432d-be62-6d14d7207e20	Over the course of its history, USA Network has had both great successes and big disappointments when it comes to their original scripted shows. Which of the current ones will be cancelled or renewed for another season? Stay tuned! Scripted USA Network shows listed: Benched, Complications, Covert Affairs, Dig, Graceland, Mr. Robot, Psych, Royal Pains, Rush, Satisfaction, Sirens, Suits and White Collar. Update: Latest ratings for Graceland added. There’s lots of data that USA Network execs look at when deciding whether to renew or cancel a TV series but ratings are the major ingredient. Here’s an updated listing of all of their recent/current primetime scripted shows. Note: If you’re not seeing the updated charts, please try reloading the page. You can also view them here and here. How are your shows doing? Check the other current rankings:\nABC | CBS | The CW | FOX | NBC\nABC Family | AMC | FX | HBO | MTV | Showtime | Syfy | TNT A couple of notes about these charts:\nThese figures are updated automatically as new ratings are released (usually a day or so after the broadcasts). The averages are based on the final national numbers (live plus same day viewing). For technical reasons, I have to resort them manually so feel free to let me know if I missed something. The demo numbers, which are typically most important to the broadcast networks, aren’t quite as vital to cable channels because their audiences are usually much smaller.

with Islam requiring all Muslims to perform Hajj once in their lifetime Saudi officials use 100,000 police and large numbers of stewards to ensure safety and help those who lose their way Comes weeks after crane toppled into the Grand Mosque killing more than 100 people and injuring hundreds more  \nAt least 717 people have been crushed to death and hundreds of others hurt in a stampede of pilgrims  in one of the worst incidents in years to hit the Muslim Hajj in Saudi Arabia. \n\nSaudi Arabia's civil defence service said rescue operations were under way after the stampede in Mina, where almost two million pilgrims were taking part in the last major rite of the Hajj. \n\nAmateur video shared on social media showed a horrific scene, with scores of bodies – the men dressed in the simple terry cloth garments worn during Hajj – lying amid crushed wheelchairs and water bottles along a sunbaked street. \n\nSurvivors assessed the scene from the top of roadside stalls near white tents as rescue workers in orange and yellow vests combed the area, placing victims on stretchers and desperately trying to resuscitate others. \n\n   \n   \nPilgrims gather around victims of a stampede which has killed hundreds of Muslims during the annual hajj pilgrimage in Mina, Saudi Arabia \n   \nHajj horror: The stampede occurred in a morning surge of pilgrims at the intersection of streets 204 and 223 as the faithful were making their way toward a large structure overlooking the columns, according to the Saudi civil defense directorate \n  \nMore than 220 rescue vehicles and some 4,000 members of the emergency services were deployed soon after the stampede to try to ease the congestion and provide alternative exit routes \n   \nRescue workers treat a pilgrim after hundreds of people were crushed to death and nearly 400 hurt in a stampede in Saudi Arabia \n   \nA medic performs CPR on a Muslim after a stampede killed and injured hundreds of pilgrims in the holy city of Mina during the Hajj pilgrimage \n   \nTerrifying: Pictures and video revealed a horrific scene, with scores of bodies – the men dressed in the simple terry cloth garments worn during Hajj – lying amid crushed wheelchairs and water bottles along a sunbaked street \n    \nIt was not immediately clear what had caused the stampede.  \n\nPilgrims had converged on Mina just outside Mecca on Thursday to throw pebbles at one of three walls representing Satan, the symbolic 'stoning of the devil' that marks the last day of the event.  \n\nThe world's 1.5billion Muslims were marking Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, the most important holiday of the Islamic calendar. \n\nThe Hajj is among the five pillars of Islam and every capable Muslim must perform it at least once in a lifetime. \n \nIn the past, the pilgrimage was for years marred by stampedes and fires, but it had been largely incident-free for nearly a decade following safety improvements. \n\nPreparations for this year's Hajj were marred when on September 11 a construction crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site, killing 109 people. \n\nIn January 2006, 364 pilgrims were killed in a stampede during the stoning ritual in Mina.  \n   \nHealth workers help the wounded near Saudi Arabia's holy Muslim city of Mecca after the stampede killed and injured hundreds of pilgrims \n   \nHazard: The stampede was the deadliest disaster at the Hajj since 2006, when more than 360 pilgrims were killed in a crush in the same area \n\nThursday's ritual was taking place at a five-storey structure known as the Jamarat Bridge, which cost more than $1billion to build and was used during earlier pilgrimages. \n\nAlmost one kilometre  long, it resembles a parking garage and allows 300,000 pilgrims an hour to carry out the ritual. \n\nThe faithful had gathered until dawn Thursday at nearby Muzdalifah where they chose their pebbles and stored them in empty water bottles. \n\nIt was not immediately clear if the stoning ritual at Mina would continue as planned until Saturday after the stampede. \n\nYesterday, they had spent a day of prayer on a vast Saudi plain and Mount Arafat, a rocky hill about 10 kilometres  from Mina, for the peak of the Hajj pilgrimage. \n\nThe flow of exhausted pilgrims was so big that Saudi security forces had to form a human chain along the roads of the vast Arafat plain while a jets of water were sprayed on the huge crowds to keep them cool amid searing heat.  \n   \nEn masse: Nearly two million Muslims make their way to cast stones at a pillar symbolising the stoning of Satan in a ritual called Jamarat \n   \nDisaster: The tragedy happened as pilgrims converged on Mina just outside Mecca to throw pebbles (above) at one of three walls representing Satan, the symbolic 'stoning of the devil' that marks the last day of the event \n   \nThe faithful had gathered until dawn on Thursday at nearby Muzdalifah where they chose their pebbles and stored them in empty water bottles \n\nMany of the faithful from around the globe camped at the foot of Mount Arafat where they slept and prayed – despite the scorching sun – at the spot where Prophet Mohammed is believed to have given his final sermon.  \n\nCarrying colourful umbrellas, they walked from dawn in massive crowds towards the slippery, rocky hill which is also known as Mount Mercy. \n\nHere they believe Mohammed gave his final sermon 14 centuries ago after leading his followers on Hajj.  \n\nMany reached Arafat by bus while some walked from the holy city of Mecca about nine miles away. Along the way, volunteers handed out boxes of food and cold water bottles. \n\nFor many pilgrims, Hajj is the spiritual highlight of their lives.  \n\n'We feel blessed. I got goosebumps, a feeling that cannot be explained, when reaching the top of the mountain,' said Ruhaima Emma, a 26-year-old Filipina pilgrim, who said she has been 'praying for a good life for everyone'.  \n   \nTens of thousands of Muslims defied the scorching sun to perform prayers in Arafat during the annual Hajj pilgrimage yesterday \n   \nOn the move: Millions of Muslim pilgrims set off before dawn yesterday to make their way to a day of prayer at the foot of Mount Arafat \n   \nWater vapour sprays down from metal pipes to cool the crowds of tens of thousands of Muslims during their day of prayers at Arafat yesterday \n   \nGlobal gathering: They walked from dawn in massive crowds towards the slippery, rocky hill which is also known as Mount Mercy \n   \nMany of the faithful from around the globe camped at the foot of Mount Arafat where they slept and prayed despite the scorching sun at the spot where Prophet Mohammed is believed to have given his final sermon \n   \nTaking in the view: Huge numbers were up and about before first light ahead of a day of prayer on the Plain of Arafat - nine miles from Mecca \n   \nMany reached Arafat by bus while some walked from the holy city of Mecca about nine miles away. Along the way, volunteers handed out boxes of food and cold water bottles \n   \nMany carried umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun as they performed their prayers this morning with hundreds of thousands of others \n   \nA wagon filled with fruit is stationed in the middle of a huge crowd of pilgrims as they worship at the foot of Mount Arafat \n  \nMany of the exhausted pilgrims slept at the foot of Mount Arafat (right) after walking the nine miles from Mecca with thousands of others (left) \n   \nPilgrims believe that thi was the spot where Mohammed gave his final sermon 14 centuries ago after leading his followers on Hajj \n   \nCrowds crammed together as they prepared for a day of worship. Many were brought in by bus but thousands walked from Mecca \n\nFor Akram Ghannam, 45, from war-torn Syria, being in Arafat is a 'feeling that cannot be described. I pray to God for the victory of all those who are oppressed.' \n\nOther pilgrims arrived from nearby Mina using the elevated Mashair Railway linking the holy sites of Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina, a tent city where many pilgrims spent Tuesday night.  \n\nThis year's gathering is about the same size as last year's, with 1.4 million foreign pilgrims joining hundreds of thousands of Saudis and residents of the kingdom.  \n\nIslam requires all able-bodied Muslims to perform the Hajj once in a lifetime – and each year huge crowds are drawn to Mecca to carry out a series of rituals and prayers aimed at erasing past sins. \n\nPictures yesterday show newly-arrived pilgrims circling the Kaaba, the black cube-shaped structure in Mecca's Grand Mosque toward which all Muslims pray.  \n   \nThis year's gathering is about the same size as last year's, with 1.4 million foreign pilgrims joining hundreds of thousands of Saudis and residents of the kingdom \n   \nA day to remember: Two pilgrims used a selfie stick as they pictured themselves near Mount Arafat before dawn this morning \n   \nAfter sunset on Wednesday they will move to Muzdalifah where there they will gather pebbles for a symbolic stoning of the devil ritual \n   \nFor many pilgrims, it is the spiritual highlight of their lives. Islam requires all able-bodied Muslims to perform the Hajj once in a lifetime \n\nSaudi authorities deploy 100,000 police and vast numbers of stewards to ensure safety and help those who lose their way.

Here I am.' \n\nMany prayed for their deceased kin. Sadi Zawya, who lost his wife earlier year and is now raising his five children on his own was among the sea of people. \n\nArriving from Egypt, 62-year-old Hoda Darahim said her 35 year-old daughter died this year, and that she is now raising her two grandchildren, relying on financial help from her older sons and the small government pension she receives. \n   \nIn Mecca, they circle the Kaaba counterclockwise seven times, and also re-enact the path of Hagar, the wife of the patriarch Abraham, who Muslims believe ran between two hills searching for water for her dying young son \n   \nThe main day of Hajj this year falls on Wednesday, when between 2 to 3 million pilgrims gather in a valley called Arafat, packed shoulder to shoulder in prayer \n   \nMuslim pilgrims pray while touching the Kaaba. Saudi authorities deploy 100,000 police and vast numbers of stewards to ensure safety and help those who lose their way \n\n'Her dream was to perform the Hajj,' Darahim said of her daughter. 'So I am fulfilling her wish.' \n\nMoussa bin Abdullah Butu, a 38-year-old artist from Nigeria, said this will be his third Hajj but an especially challenging one since he lost his two-year old son, Abdullah, to a long illness earlier this year. 'In the white ihram, the rich man and the poor, we are all together,' he said. \n\nThe Hajj requires physical perseverance, finances and a coveted Hajj visa, which is limited to country-by-country quotas to manage crowd safety. Butu said he was very grateful for his visa and the opportunity to once again perform the hajj. \n\n'I know that I am one of the people that Allah chose ... I am one of the people Allah called this year,' Butu said. \n\nThe main day of Hajj this year falls on Wednesday, when between 2 to 3 million pilgrims gather in a valley called Arafat, packed shoulder to shoulder in prayer.  \n\nIt is at Arafat where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon some 1,400 years ago, calling for equality and unity among Muslims. \n  STAMPEDES, FALLING CRANES AND COLLAPSED BUILDINGS: HOW THOUSANDS HAVE DIED ON THE HAJJ PILGRIMAGE     \nEvery year, millions of Muslims converge on the Saudi holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the annual Hajj pilgrimage, with the massive ceremonies representing a major security and logistical challenge for the kingdom's authorities. \n\nOn occasion, the Hajj and events surrounding it have been marred by accidents and tragedies, such as today's stampede near Mecca. \n\nHere's a look at some deadly hajj-related incidents: \n\n2015: At least 107 people are killed and scores wounded when a crane collapses in bad weather, crashing onto the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam's holiest site.  \n\n2006:  More than 360 pilgrims are killed in a stampede at the desert plain of Mina, near Mecca, where pilgrims carry out a symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing pebbles against three stone walls.  \n\nThe day before the Hajj began, an eight-story building being used as a hostel near the Grand Mosque in Mecca collapsed, killing at least 73 people.  \n\n2004: A crush of pilgrims at Mina kills 244 pilgrims and injures hundreds on the final day of the hajj ceremonies.  \n\n2001 : A stampede at Mina during the final day of the pilgrimage ceremonies kills 35 Hajj pilgrims.  \n\n1998: About 180 pilgrims are trampled to death in panic after several of them fell off an overpass during the final stoning ritual at Mina.  \n\n1997: At least 340 pilgrims are killed in a fire at the tent city of Mina as the blaze was aided by high winds. More than 1,500 were injured. \n\n1994: Some 270 pilgrims are killed in a stampede during the stoning ritual at Mina. \n\n1990: The worst hajj-related tragedy claims the lives of 1,426 pilgrims in a stampede in an overcrowded pedestrian tunnel leading to holy sites in Mecca.
0400_b4b2bccd-56db-495f-b6df-e3cb394ae8b0	CAYMAN ISLANDS (September 21, 2015) – Russell Mellor came from Westport, Massachusetts to the Caribbean with his wife, Diane, for a relaxing vacation but instead suffered a heart attack.   Mellor was quickly transferred from George Town to Health City Cayman Islands, a destination medical center , where he was attended to by the facility’s highly experienced heart doctors.   Dr. Binoy Chattuparambil, Senior Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgeon of Health City Cayman Islands, said of Mellor: “Five of his arteries to the heart were blocked – all very tight blocks. So we decided on the surgery within five days, because he was on blood-thinning drugs that had to wear off from the body.”   At first, Diane Mellor felt she should take her husband home, but her opinion changed as she witnessed the expert level of care and attention her spouse was receiving: “When I saw the relationship that was developing with his doctors, the thoroughness of them, I began to realize that this was our best option. This was far better than going to another doctor. And I didn’t feel that I would be as comfortable any place else.”   The experienced Dr. Binoy, as he is fondly known, calmly described the surgery as smooth, as was Mellor’s recovery: “Two hours after surgery he was off the ventilator and within 48 hours he was out of the ICU.”   Russell Mellor was quick to agree: “The outcome has been fantastic. I certainly wouldn’t want to have any other kind of outcome … and that’s why we came.”   Dr. Binoy stressed Health City’s successes were rooted in teamwork: “I would say that the credit goes to the team. As you know, cardiac surgery is not a one-man show. You have that dedicated, highly-qualified anesthesiologist, intensive care doctors, the nurses, the physiotherapist. It’s because of the team that everything happened like this – a very seamless recovery.”   Looking back, Mellor recalled he never thought that a world class cardiothoracic surgery facility would be located in the Cayman Islands. “When I was going to be transferred out from George Town, I had anticipated going to the mainland…the doctors here are just fantastic, and they’ve built a major facility here. One I think the island will continuously be proud of and continuously get benefit from.”   Diane Mellor was similarly impressed with Health City: “I looked at the expertise of the physicians doing the work and I was amazed at how well qualified they were, how many surgeries they had done. So, it’s not like you’re coming to some place and you know, maybe a doctor has done this a few times. These doctors are super skilled. You couldn’t get more skilled physicians.”   As Russell Mellor was preparing to head home he spoke like someone figuratively leaving a part of his heart  behind: “When I look at the result – this heart will be good for years to come. There won’t be any having to redo this, no repeats of this at all. It’s an amazing feat, when I look at it, and at the team.”   About Health City Cayman Islands  Health City Cayman Islands, the vision of renowned heart surgeon and humanitarian Dr. Devi Shetty, is supported by two major healthcare organizations, Narayana Health and the U.S.-based Ascension, which is that nation’s largest faith-based and nonprofit health system, providing the highest quality care to all with special attention to those who are poor and vulnerable.

I will not relent one inch." \n\nHe also said he had been heartened by the level of support. \n\n"This is important, not only for me, it is important for every minister of the gospel of every denomination of freedom of speech and freedom of worship. \n\n"This is, I believe, a test case." \n\nThe case has been adjourned until October 1. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

0403_62bcc7c4-2343-4064-ba9f-ac691b0b1e32	Though some foreign investors cast doubts on Myanmar's potential, the country is bullish about greater inflows of foreign direct investment in the years to come thanks mainly to infrastructure requirement. At the Myanmar Global Investment Forum, Aung Naing Oo, director general of the Directorate of Investment and Company Registration and secretary of Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC), said Myanmar expects to welcome a significant inflow of FDI by 2017 thanks to the better legal framework, the very modernised investment law and better infrastructure. The DICA has said, foreign investment worth US$2.9 billion (S$4.07 billion)has been approved in the 2015-16 fiscal year, starting April. MIC targets $6 billion in the year. In the last fiscal year, the amount hit $8.01 billion. To achieve this, Aung Naing Oo said the government has been making efforts to create a better business climate by easing the restrictions and modernising rules and regulations over the past three years. Meanwhile, the country's infrastructure needs are huge.\n\nPart of the modernisation concerned the consolidation of two investment laws - the Foreign Investment Law and Myanmar Citizens Investment Law - to create a level playing field. Sectors restricted to foreign ownership will be clearly defined.\n\nAung Naing Oo said that MIC has not yet decided on the sectors but this will depend chiefly on local business community concerns.\n\n"But I am sure we will liberalise more in the new law and make it as little as possible for restrictions," he said.\n\nThe MIC, which deals directly with foreign investment, recently moved its office from Nay Pyi Taw to Yangon, the country's largest commercial city. A one-stop service centre was established while licensing regulations are shortened.\n\nMIC happy to receive investors\n\n"Before 2011, it was very difficult to engage with MIC. Some investors even gave us a nickname - Myanmar Impossible Commission. Now it is very easy to discuss with MIC. We are happy to receive investors at our office and answer all their questions," he said.\n\nAgreeing on the issue of attraction, foreign companies' chiefs at the conference highlighted some challenges. Mark Bedingham, president and CEO of Singapore Myanmar Investco, admitted that Myanmar is attractive for investment in power, engineering, textile, and telecom sectors. To him, transparency, clarity (of laws and regulations), and government ministries' engagement with international community will help Myanmar move forward.\n\nMichael Armstrong, director of Siward Newton, added that the national ceasefire agreement with ethnic armed groups and complete lifting of the US sanctions would be a boon to the economy.\n\nAndrew Lee, chief country representative for Myanmar of General Electric, urged private companies to engage more with the government sector.\n\nHe suggested observing to know what is happening on the ground and then find the best ways to solve the problems. Meanwhile, government agencies need to enhance their capacity. "Engaging is the only way to help Myanmar move forward. Despite challenges, I believe the government is going towards the right direction," he said.\n\nStefano Poli, president of Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Corporation Asia, noted that energy is the most promising sector but Myanmar needs further liberalisation to attract more European investors who are aware of its natural resources but still cautious about its political climate.\n\nBeside the power sector, Sunil Seth, country head of Tata, foresees growth in steel manufacturing, given the rising demand from construction and infrastructure projects. He urged the government to address land issues and electricity shortage urgently to attract more investors.
0404_9b91f148-f4db-4e36-b2ad-2ee93514aca0	One of the most frequent questions I get as a VC is how to become a VC. Newly minted MBAs and startup veterans alike want to get into the investing game in increasingly large numbers. Unfortunately, there are so few VC jobs available in any given year it makes the prospect unlikely for most. \n \nIf you want to be a VC, my advice is to just get started; you can do the job of a VC without a dollar to your name. Seriously, you don’t need a specific degree, a list of specific credentials on your CV, or scads of family money to do the job of a venture capitalist. I’d wager that almost anyone reading this post has the raw cognitive capabilities to do the work. \n How To Be A Venture Capitalist, Minus The Capital  \nThe job of a VC can be broken down into four distinct tasks: \n \nSourcing Deals:  Finding entrepreneurs at the earliest stages is a critical skill. It helps to have the imprimatur of a top-flight VC firm behind you, but fund affiliation isn’t a requirement. \n \nOne way to source deals is to find meetups for emerging technologies and identify the most interesting and industrious attendees. Tim O’Reilly calls these people “ Alpha geeks .” Chris Dixon has said that what hackers do in their garages for fun turns out to be what everyone does a decade later. If you can find groups of these people, you’re well on your way to your first investment. \n \nDiligence:  Another key aspect of the VC job is doing due diligence. This is the process where you look into the background of the founders to see if they’re credible and honest. \n \nIt also means doing a deep dive in the industry. Calling potential customers. Getting feedback from key opinion leaders. Creating a thesis for an emerging market. Working out financial models. Predicting how the market might develop. \n \nIt might be awkward to call around on individuals, but you can easily trawl for market information and craft all of this data into a compelling presentation. \n \nNegotiation:  Once you’re sold on the founders and have found enough evidence to suggest the business will succeed, the next step is hammering out finances. How much money does this founder want/need? What kind of valuation would they accept? You’re not going to finalize things at this stage, but roughing out a basic set of terms is pretty straightforward. \n Money will chase opportunity.  \nNote: It’s absolutely critical that you remain 100 percent honest during this entire process. If you represent to startups that you work for a VC firm, or suggest any relationship that isn’t recognized by the VC, you’ll instantly be blackballed. Likewise, don’t make claims about being on the team when talking to the VCs. Clearly explain what you’re doing to all parties. When in doubt, disclose. Your reputation is in the balance. \n \nFinancing:  Now you might be thinking this is where my crazy notion of being an independent VC will fall apart. Unless you can bankroll the company independently, you’ll need to find some monied investors who are willing to take a risk, right? \n \nThis sounds hard, but money will chase opportunity. If you can find compelling companies, explain why the market is attractive, why this team is equipped to dominate that market and present a framework for a deal, there will be plenty of angels or firms willing to cut a check or, at least, take a meeting. \n \nYou’ll want to be on the radar of these folks before asking them to look at any of  your “deals,” but after a couple of high-quality intros, they’ll be eager to hear from you. \n So How Do I Get Rich?  \nThere is no clear mechanism for getting cut in on the deal in this model. You could try to get a consulting check from the company, but that will likely turn them off. If your goal is being a pro VC, look at this exercise as an in-depth job interview. \n An MBA will help your chance of getting any analyst/associate role pretty dramatically.  \nThe odds of getting an analyst/associate role at any VC firm are extremely low. There just aren’t that many open spots in any given year, and VC is a business that attracts many of the best students in the world. \n \nWhen a new position opens up, it’s rarely posted on job boards. These gigs go to the people who are already standing outside the door. \n Other Things You Can Do To Increase Your Chance Of Being A VC  \nI asked Founder Collective’s current associates, Abigail Stone and Blanca Rodriguez, for some advice based on their path to VC. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances: \n \nGet Involved In The Entrepreneurial Community — Early:  Start a company. Join a high-growth startup. Get a writing gig for a major tech publication. Create a meetup group for an emerging tech/business sector. Basically, you want to become a connector with great relationships at all levels of the startup community. Do this while you’re still in college if you can. \n \nBuild Up A Social Profile:  This is related to the point above. This is especially important if you want to join a firm that focuses on consumer applications. Being an early adopter and proven tastemaker can only help your chances. It also demonstrates that you have a deep understanding of what works, and doesn’t, in the app ecosystem. \n \nFocus On The Firms Where You Want To Work:  Many of the best firms have a process for hiring associates and analysts. They frequently tweet these positions out, often with specific application requests and short timelines. Their goal is to find people who are REALLY interested in their firms. \n \nFollow the partners on Twitter. If they host events, try to get into them. If they run a forum, contribute to it. Demonstrate a track record of interest before you ask them to get interested in you. \n \nGet Educated:  An MBA will help your chance of getting any analyst/associate role pretty dramatically, for many reasons: \n There are two basic paths to becoming a VC: founding a successful startup, or going through a sort of finance apprenticeship. Founder VCs are judged on the success or failure of their startups. VCs from the finance path tend to have MBAs and will look to recruit people with similar skill sets from similar institutions.  You need advanced analytical skills to do the job. You need to be able to research disparate markets rapidly, run Net Present Value and discounted cash flow calculations at a moments notice. Manipulating pivot tables with a pinky finger is a must. These are skills that you’ll learn in strong MBA programs.  A large, successful network is a VC’s best tool. These are the people who will refer promising startups to you. They’re also the ones you will be able call to do diligence work and provide references. Networks can be built in any number of ways, but a top-flight MBA will accelerate the process dramatically.  Business school programs can expose you to organizations designed to funnel students into finance careers. INSITE or other VC-related associations can have a huge impact on your ability to secure a job in the VC business.  \nCreate Original Research:  Another approach is to research an aspect of the startup world. What’s driving the boom in food startups? What would be the positive side effects of a broad economic downturn? It doesn’t really matter what the topic is, as long as it’s interesting, but this is a way to highlight two important skills: research and presentation. \n \nThere is a 100 percent chance that you will be asked which markets/technologies/products you find interesting during an interview at a VC firm. Most candidates will throw out a few names of startups, likely ones that are already funded and seem like surefire winners. \n If you want to be a VC, my advice is to just get started.  \nOne-up those people by pulling up a slide deck that slices and dices the market. Even better, pull up your blog where you trace the developments in the market. Bonus points if you can show a bunch of KOLs in the space tweeting out your posts. Double bonus points if you’ve been tracking a hot sector for years and correctly called the companies that would thrive and those that wouldn’t. \n VC Is An Outliers Business  \nLike I said before, even with these credentials and assets, the odds are still long. And there are plenty of VCs who have forged successful, yet unorthodox paths. Sequoia’s Michael Moritz was a journalist before going on to fund iconic companies like Zappos, so you can say it worked out pretty well for him. \n  Featured Image: Hurst Photo / Shutterstock

0406_52fc9e50-80d1-4852-b1cd-c8193816ed34	NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The turmoil in China may make you wary of investing in the stock market, but it won't keep you from spending money. \n \nAnd that's precisely what makes payment networks like Visa  , Mastercard  and PayPal  ideal investments, according to a new report from investment bank Nomura. \n \nAll three have a "buy" rating from New York-based analyst Bill Carcache, who says they're bargains because the slowdown in China's economy, the world's second-largest, has pulled global markets lower. \n \n"History tells us that dips can present buying opportunities in payment network stocks," Carcache wrote. "Investors navigating the current market should view incremental future volatility as a way to opportunistically accumulate shares of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal at more attractive valuations." \n \nThe companies will likely post earnings gains of 14% or more during 2016 and 2017, he wrote, as purchase volumes increase. \n \n"Within the payments ecosystem, we view mobile, loyalty and rewards as the most compelling investible themes and see Visa, Mastercard and PayPal at the intersection of all three," he wrote. "Credit-card issuers remain engaged in a rewards war as they battle for consumer loyalty, and the digitization of commerce is driving a convergence between the online and offline channels, with mobile devices serving as the bridge." \n \nLinked to both trends is an overall increase in consumer credit-card spending, according to a recent study by CardHub. During the second quarter of 2015, consumers accumulated $32.1 billion in new balances, a 14% increase from same period last year and 86% higher than two years ago. \n \n"We expect outstanding credit card debt to cross $900 billion by the end of the year, bringing the average indebted household's balance to $7,813 -- the highest amount since the Great Recession and $615 below the tipping point CardHub identified as being unsustainable," the company said in its study. \n    next   last »

John Kasich has held steady in New Hampshire, at 12%, enough to land him in second place for now -- but is still well behind Trump.

0409_7f52fb2c-e483-4ba5-81f0-bb434f6fdf61	PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU/ \n2         Reads                        0     Comments \nReal Madrid’s iconic former right-back Michel Salgado has suggested the club’s current talisman Cristiano Ronaldo is under-appreciated when put in direct comparison to Lionel Messi. \n \nSalgado was speaking at an event introducing La Liga ambassadors and compared the Portuguese superstar to his current Barcelona rival and the Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who played alongside Salgado during his playing days at the Santiago Bernabeu, per Marca: \n \nRonaldo Nazario was, without doubt, the best striker I've ever seen. What I saw him do was spectacular, and that was having come to the club after a World Cup and having been sidelined for two years before that with a knee injury. \n \nCristiano is different, he's a self-made player. His work ethic is spectacular and what he's doing is impressive, equalling Messi's stats and winning Ballons d'Or. I don't think people appreciate Ronaldo's value and the effort he puts into achieving what he achieves. \n \n PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU/ \n \nAfter a slow start to the season in the opening couple of weeks, Ronaldo has burst into life in Los Blancos’ last two matches. He’s scored a staggering eight goals in wins over Espanyol in La Liga and Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, serving up a timely reminder of his incredible prowess in front of goal. \n \nRonaldo became Real’s all-time top scorer in league matches with his quintet of strikes against Espanyol. As noted here by Bleacher Report UK, it’s a mark he surpassed in incredibly quick time: \n \nCristiano Ronaldo broke Real Madrid’s La Liga scoring record in 347 games fewer than Raul. 347. pic.twitter.com/ZEYrROokwV \n \n— Bleacher Report UK (@br_uk) September 15, 2015 \n \nIn addition, Ronaldo’s hat-trick against Shakhtar moved him three clear of Messi in the race to become the Champions League’s most prolific player. But that’s a duel that is likely to continue for years to come yet. \n \nSo while many may point to Messi as the finest player in the world, you could certainly argue Ronaldo should receive a little more reverence than he does currently. Two all-time greats in the same era will always have to share the spotlight, though, meaning there could be an argument that the Barca man should probably be a little more heralded himself. \n \n OLIVIER MORIN/                                                                             Ronaldo and Messi will continue to tussle over various records. \n \nIndeed, sports journalist Rafael Hernandez suggested that Ronaldo’s goals, while they may be many in number, are often not that significant: \n \nRaúl won Real Madrid 54 league points more than Cristiano Ronaldo  with his goals. Difference between having six leagues and one. \n— Rafael Hernández (@RafaelH117) September 15, 2015 \nIf Real are to achieve success this season, you suspect some key goals from the Portuguese will be central to their charge. But Salgado also paid tribute to the defensive structure of the team, which seems to be improving under new manager Rafael Benitez: “He's trying to tighten the team up a little more at the back and to get Bale to produce more for Real Madrid than he did last year by tweaking his position.” \n \n PAUL CROCK/                                                  Is Ronaldo under-appreciated?                                                                         Yes, he should be getting more praise for his goalscoring feats.                                                                                    No, he's not quite up to Messi's standards.                                                                                                                                                                                         Submit Vote         vote to see results \n\nThere’s no denying Ronaldo is a phenomenal goalscorer. He may not be the daring, tricky wide player who thrilled so many during his time at Manchester United and early days at Real, but he’s adjusted his game into becoming the best out-and-out poacher in the world. \n \nThe next phase of the Portuguese’s career is going to be an intriguing one. Slowly he seems to be moving further up the pitch into a role as a central striker, while Messi is likely to drop deeper in order to be more involved with general play. So while the two will continue to be compared, it’s likely they’ll become even further removed in terms of playing style.

Of those shows making their fall debuts is ABC’s hit series “How to Get Away With Murder.” The show premiered last year as a part of the network’s “Thank God It’s Thursday” Shonda Rhimes trio and, like everything the “Grey’s Anatomy” writer creates, it was an instant hit. “HTGAWM” returns for Season 2 Thursday. Before the premiere let’s take a look back at where viewers left off with Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) and her five star students. \n\nIn the Season 1 finale viewers finally got the answer to a burning question: who killed Lila Stangard (Megan West)? As we previously reported, the two-hour episode started with Wes (Alfred Enoch) convinced that girlfriend Rebecca (Katie Findlay) had killed Lila. He and the rest of the Keating Five had previously thought their professor’s husband, Sam (Tom Verica), was responsible, but new evidence from a key source caused him to waiver. \n\nWes and Laurel (Karla Souza) decided to pay a visit to Rudy ( Jake Mikesell), the student who had lived in Wes’ apartment prior to his moving in. Shortly after Lila’s murder Rudy was institutionalized. Although he was mentally unstable at the time of their visit, he was able to provide an important clue as to what may have happened to Lila. When shown a picture of Rebecca, Rudy simply said, “wet.” The single word turned the entire case upside down as Wes shifted from blaming Sam to blaming his girlfriend. Laurel urged him not to get ahead of himself and avoid confronting her right away. He agreed, but continued to dig for more evidence. Wes pulled police files from the case, hoping to find more information linking Rebecca to the murder. \n\nAs he investigated further viewers were shown a flashback to a fight Rebecca and Lila had in the month leading to her tragic death. Lila came to Rebecca one afternoon to let her know she was no l…

0412_1daa6797-0361-4f9e-b82e-b0f26e73e9ed	Kris Lees is happy with the starting point for Protectionist and Lucia Valentina in the Saturday's Tramway Quality but the star pair's preparation still remain flexible in the Melbourne spring. Kris Lees is happy with the starting point for Protectionist and Lucia Valentina in Saturday's Tramway Quality at Randwick, but the star pair's preparation still remains flexible heading into the Melbourne spring. Melbourne Cup winner Protectionist is heading towards the first Tuesday in November "whether it is through the Caulfield Cup or Herbert Power [Handicap] has to be decided" after a couple of runs in Sydney, Lees said.\n\nLucia Valentina could earn her way to the Cox Plate if things go to plan. The mare returns in the same race as last year, where she dominated with an electrifying turn of foot on a wet track in a preparation in which she went on to win the Turnbull Stakes and finished third in the Caulfield Cup.\n\n"She is probably not going to get the conditions she got last year but she is more mature and I'm very happy she is where she needs to be," Lees said. "It is a tough race but she has shown in the past she can sprint well fresh.\n\n"There are plenty of options for her in the spring and I think we are going to see a better mare this time, so we are no tying ourselves down. I haven't mapped out a preparation for her yet, but I think she is in for a big preparation the way she is going."\n\nThe 1400m of the Tramway is short of the best distance for Protectionist but Lees believes he will have enough fitness to run competitively.\n\n"We had a little setback with him, so the 1400m will suit him better than the Chelmsford Stakes. This will give him a good blow-out before he starts to step [up] in trip," Lees said. "He is a stayer but I think he will be on their tails on Saturday. We just need to get a grounding for him to get out in journey."\n\nThe pair are likely to be Lees' only runners at Randwick as Marple Miss and Oriental Lady will run in the features at Wyong on Friday.\n\nThe blinkers go onto Marple Miss as she drops back in distance, after being placed in town last start, in the Mona Lisa Stakes.\n\n"We just thought the blinkers would sharpen her up as she steps up to black type. I think she could stretch out to a mile this time but she is still good enough from that draw [of five] to give that race a shake," Lees said.\n\nOriental Lady will take advantage of being the limit weight of 54kg in the Wyong Cup, where Lees will also have Slow Pace.\n\n"She has been able to run good races at that level before so it's worth giving her a chance," he said. "Slow Pace, at his best, would be up to winning the Wyong Cup but he tends to mix his form, so we are hoping he will put his best foot forward." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

0414_54ff48a6-c238-4717-a997-3a9b85fa573b	Black Mass   \nIn the film Black Mass, Johnny Depp erases any remote vestige of the light, somewhat whimsical and oddball characters that he has played in many of his recent films. Instead, Depp uses his amazingly chilling portrayal of infamous Boston mobster James “Whitey” Bulger to completely envelop, transform and, indeed, disappear into an on-screen character that is the epitome of evil and criminal depravity. \n \nYet, the brilliance of Depp’s performance is that this reptilian malevolence is often deceptively cloaked beneath a razor thin veneer of charismatic charm. Perhaps as the real Whitey Bulger was reported to be like; Depp’s Bulger is convincingly genteel enough to woo an adoring smile from a grateful elderly resident of South Boston that his thugs help early in the film; while later, he shakes an apologetic friend’s hand while watching one of his murderous underlings blow the unfortunate guy’s brains out from behind in mid grasp. \n \nBlack Mass is based on the non-fiction book written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O’Neill that meticulously chronicled the period during the 1970’s into the 80’s during which Bulger’s infamous Winter Hill Gang ruled Boston’s underworld with vicious, ruthless and cold-blooded impunity. As in the book, director Scott Cooper focuses on the unholy alliance between the FBI and Bulger; as the feds believe they’re using Bulger as an informant to take down what they believe is the city’s bigger threat, the Mafia in Boston’s North End. \n \nHowever, it’s the relationship between Bulger and his former neighborhood friend now FBI agent John Connolly ( Joel Edgerton ) that is central to this story. Connolly believes Bulger will provide information against the Italian Mob, and by extension, raise his cachet within the FBI. However, Bulger sees an opportunity to eventually turn the tables and once free of Mafia opposition, rule the city’s crime shadows through a seemingly endless series of brutal murders, racketeering, drug dealing and even gun running to the IRA in Northern Ireland. \n \nFactually, there’s nothing new in the film that wasn’t effectively covered in Joe Berlinger’s 2014 documentary, Whitey; nor for anyone who actually lived through the horror of Whitey Bulger’s reign of terror in Boston and his recent sensational trial for his crimes. However, what sets this film apart are the marvelous performances by its ensemble cast, led by an amazing and award worthy performance by Johnny Depp. \n \nJoel Edgerton is marvelous as the smarmy and manipulative FBI agent John Connolly, a character willing to sell his soul and morality to move up the agency food chain; while turning a blind eye to the evil he himself has unleashed with an unfettered Bulger. \n \nJesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane as Bulger’s henchmen, Kevin Weeks and Stephen Flemmi respectively turn in fine performances.  Cochrane has a truly notable scene as he silently and dutifully watches Bulger himself brutally murder someone his character loves.  The brutality takes place mostly off camera; however the vicious horror and pain is written all over Cochrane’s silent and agonized face as he’s forced to watch. \n \nThe female actresses in this film, Dakota Johnson as Bulger’s wife and Julianne Nicholson as Connolly’s wife, Marianne both have stellar moments on screen; unfortunately via their characters being on the receiving end of Bulger’s simmering venom and murderous rage. \n \nIndeed, arguably it’s Depp’s scenes with these two female characters that show the full range of his exceptional performance as a chilling psychopath.  In one scene, Depp is a doting father over his adorable young son; albeit giving the young tyke parental advice more suitable for one of his hit men, while his wife looks on mildly disapproving yet faithful to her man. \n \nHowever, when a tragedy strikes their son, Johnson as Bulger’s wife is faced with the literal transformation before her eyes of her husband into a steely-eyed, threatening killer when she suggests a humane resolution to their son’s terminal condition. The transformation is bone-chilling for her, and for the audience as well. \n \nSadly, actor Benedict Cumberbatch is woefully miscast as Whitey’s brother, William Bulger who was one of the most powerful politicians in the state during Whitey’s crime reign. \n \nStill, Black Mass is Johnny Depp’s showcase. His equally chilling yet charismatic portrayal of one America’s most infamous and vicious criminals; at one point second only to Osama Bin Laden on the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted List, is a superbly earned jump start to a career that had arguably grown stagnant. \n \nLike it’s central character, Black Mass is vicious, brutal and dark. It is also marvelously unforgettable.
0415_ff25c622-8c69-4de2-8ddc-b4128a5ddff9	 \nJohannesburg - Fairland schoolboy Keanan Greyson plans to start his teens on a high note, by summiting Mount Kilimanjaro's Uhuru peak on his 13th birthday on October 4. \n\nBut every step he takes will not be for bragging rights, but to thank his community, and to raise money for less fortunate children and families who live there. \n\n"I am a privileged child at Laerskool [Primary School] Fairland and I want to help the people who are being assisted by Vriende van Fairland [VVF] [Friends of Fairland \n\n]." \n\nAll of the expenses for his party of six, which includes his 71-year-old grandfather Stef, will be paid for by themselves, meaning every cent he raises will go to the community organisation. \n\n"They use the money to buy food parcels, clothes, stationery, medicines," he explained. \n\nHis proud granny Inamarie, who climbed 5 895 metres to the highest point in Africa with her husband 10 years ago, said they had always promised to take Keanan up Kili, as it is popularly known. \n\nBut it was Keanan who came up with the idea to use the trip to raise money for less fortunate families at his school who are enduring difficult private struggles as they try to educate their children. \n\n"Keanan wanted to do something," said Inamarie. \n\nThe party will take a longer eight day trip to acclimatise as they move from fields to forest to a snow capped peak, to lessen the chance of altitude sickness. \n\nTo prepare for the trip Keanan has been walking around with a stuffed backpack and boots, setting the treadmill to "incline 10", swimming, and exercising at every opportunity - on top of the endless stream of school work and assignments he has to do. \n\nLast week they did a…

I was tired and confused and hoped my midwife would explain my medical history because we had discussed me having a c-section,' said Ms Barrell. \n\nMs Barrell said based on her past two pregnancies and the fact her two-year-old daughter Zoe has brain damage due to a complicated pregnancy - Zoe inhaled meconium during birth and stopped breathing - a caesarean section should have occurred straight away. \n   \nMr Harding's other children made him a memory box to honour baby Charlotte who only lived 10 hours \n   \nMr Harding's Facebook messgae about his bitter- sweet Father's Day after baby Charlotte passed away \n\n'It wasn't until my baby's heart rate stopped that they rushed me into to an emergency c-section. That was too late,' she said. \n\n'I was going through the traumatic loss of a child and it was not until I looked back that I realised they failed me.  \n\n'All the staff were really good with us but the senior doctor and the midwife who made the call not to take me in for a c-section earlier stuffed up.' \n\nMr Harding struggled with the death of his daughter who he said passed away peacefully in his arm as he sang to her.  \n   \nMr Harding with his two-year-old daughter Zoe who suffered brain damage after complications during her birth \n\nLike his partner, he believes a senior doctor failed to assess Ms Barrell's case properly. \n\n'I am just so upset with that senior doctor. He actually admitted he didn't even read Stacey's medical record before he made decisions. She should have been taken into have a c-section straight away,' Mr Harding said.  \n\nAn investigation into the circumstances surrounding baby Charlotte's death is under way by the both MidCentral District Health Board and the police, who are acting on behalf of the coroner.  \n   \nMr Harding shared a heartfelt Faceook post as he deals with losing a second child \n\nWhen Daily Mail Australia contacted Palmerston North Hospital in New Zealand for comment, the hospital referred to a previous statement made to Fairfax. \n\nSpecialist community and regional services operations director Nicholas Glubb stold Stuff.co.nz that care provided to Charlotte and Ms Barrell is being reviewed. \n\n'When we have the information and findings of the reviews we will make that information available to the family. \n   \nMr Harding (left) and Ms Barrell (right) told Daily Mail Australia they hope no other parent experiences what they went through  \n\n'We expect these reviews to be complete by late November 2015 given the structured nature of the review and the complexities of the issues involved,' Mr Glubb said.  \n\nMs Barrell and Mr Harding said they will continue to fight so this incident is not repeated. \n\n'We value the staff at the hospital but are upset that a senior doctor and midwife ignored us. I want doctors and midwives to be more vigilant and hospitals not to be over-crowded. \n\n'No parent should have to experience this,' Mr Harding told Daily Mail Australia. \n\nA friend of Ms Barrell and Mr Harding has set up a   G ivealittle fundraising page to help the family with the costs associated with Charlotte's funeral.

0418_810b1e0d-5513-4974-b708-9832327db098	My trusty, well-traveled, hard-sided suitcase, perfect for things you don’t want crushed. Image credit: Ruth Suehle. \n \nDragon Con starts this week. That means it’s time for the last-minute frenzied packing. Quick, somebody make a list! No worries—got that covered for you. Even if you aren’t Atlanta-bound this weekend, you can bookmark it for your next con, or possibly even your next vacation, assuming you like to spend time on the beach in your Avengers suit. \n \nI’m a frequent traveler with airline and hotel status and enough nights away from home that I can tell you what brand pillows are on the Sheraton beds. (Those things are awesome.) I’ve also been doing Dragon Con for 13 years. This is my ultimate packing list of that accumulated knowledge. It comes with one rule: If it’s not on the list, it’s not in the bag. You might say to yourself, “Of course I’ll remember the bobby pins.” Tell me that again when you get all suited up and can’t do your hair. \n \nCostumes \nCostumes each get their own packing lists. To emphasize the rule, if it’s not on the list, it’s not in the bag . The last thing I do when I make a costume is make a list of every single piece that’s required for it. Need the black full-body Spanx? Pearl earrings? No matter how small, or clearly impossible to forget, they’re on the list. (I don’t list regular underwear in these since that’s in the clothing section, but if it only fits with a specific bra, that goes on the list.) For example, here’s my list for Nyssa al Ghul: \n      Jacket  Pants  Belt  Quiver  Arrows  Bow  Black stompy boots  Flat black boots  Gloves  Bracers  Socks  Shoulder/chest piece  Hood  Veil  Sword  Black Mehron disc (for hair)  Sponge (for applying the color)     \n\nImage credit: Debadeep Sen Photography \n    \nI have two pairs of boots listed because while normally I wear the heeled boots, sometimes it’s day four of the con, and I want to suit up, but I just can’t look at the heels anymore, so I go flat. Thus, they both go on the list. \n \nDon’t forget to list handheld items, like a weapon or other prop. \n \nWhether you list makeup with each costume or in a separate makeup section is up to you. I end up packing a makeup arsenal, so I list it separately below, and I list a specific item only if it’s unusual to the arsenal, like a gold eyeliner I rarely use except for my Jean Grey costume or the blue lipstick my daughter uses for her Skylanders costume. \n \nThe Repair Kit \nThere was a time I swore I’d never take a sewing machine to a con. Then there was the time I did. Now I’m back to swearing that off. So this is what I now consider a repair kit. If yours includes a machine, you probably don’t need me to help you make this list! \n  Glue gun, duct tape, and safety pins: There is little that can’t be stuck back together with one of this magical trifecta. If you really want to get serious, add some E-6000.  Heat gun: Either for re-shaping foam pieces or melting hot glue that went where it shouldn’t.  Needles and thread to match all the costumes  Fabric scissors and sewing scissors  Paint and brushes for touch-ups  Spare parts of whatever is in your costume—rivets, buttons, grommets, buckles that might come loose—and the tools required to insert them.  Spare pieces if you think you might need to remake or patch something—for example, a few extra chunks of foam or Worbla if you have a fragile piece.  Zip ties  Velcro  Hooks and eyes  Sew-on snaps  Fray-Check  Extra wires, batteries, LEDs, or other electronics parts if your costume needs them.  Tide pen, because you just had to have BBQ for lunch, didn’t you?  Multi-tool   \nThis is a good time to note that if you’re traveling by car, you can pack everything in the world. If you’re flying, you might have to pare down to the essentials. Think about what’s most likely to break on your costume, and bring the things to fix that. \n \nElectronics \nI confess. We travel with too many electronics. Again, driving versus flying, but I carry much of this everywhere regardless. My husband has a bag we use that we even have come to refer to as “the electronics bag.” I list every item’s power cable separately because one inevitably gets left behind. \n  Laptop (play music, look for restaurants, download pictures from your camera)  Laptop power cable  WiFi hotspot  Tablet  e-Reader  Phone  Enough USB cables to charge the things that use them  Power packs ( like this )  Camera  Camera batteries or charger  Extra memory cards  Waterproof camera  Power strip—because no hotel room has enough outlets   \nHair and Makeup \nThis one’s going to be more personalized, depending on your needs. But especially if you don’t travel often, it’s the most important one for the “on the list” rule. You will forget something. \n  Makeup kit (don’t forget to list any specific items that are costume-critical)  Makeup remover  Curlers  Mousse, gel, spray, or other hair products  Bobby pins  Straightening iron  Hairbrush  Round brush  Deodorant  Razors  Toothbrush  Toothpaste  Eye drops  Contact lens supplies  Spare contacts  Glasses  Nail clippers  Band-Aids (entire first aid kit if you’re accident-prone or cautious—I was certainly appreciative of the person carrying one the year I cut my head open!)  Moleskin (if you’re blister prone)  Your lady-time supplies of choice, because even if you’ve never had breakthrough bleeding in your life, your uterus knows when you’re unprepared and not in a situation to deal with it easily.  Any medications  Painkillers of your preference (that aren’t liquor)  Tiger Balm—we’re old. Muscles hurt. Wintergreen smells good.  Earplugs if your roommates snore (hi, Neal!)   \nI don’t usually pack the things that hotels have—soap, shampoo, blow dryers, but if you are attached to yours, add them to the list. And if you’re a wig person, don’t forget all your wig accoutrements. \n \nWhatever liquids you do pack—hair gel, shampoo, contact lens solution—wrap it in a plastic bag. The last thing you want is to get to the con and discover all of your clothes are covered in conditioner because the lid popped open or something crushed it. \n \nCon Needs \nIf you’re flying, this is the stuff that should be in your carry-on, just in case. \n  Lanyard (for your badge—they’re sometimes not provided, and Dragon Con is one of those times)  Badge pickup confirmation (for Dragon Con, your postcard)  Photo ID  Small bag for carrying around daytime essentials, like the program guide, water bottle, phone, camera, etc.  Reusable water bottle  Cash—the ATMs around the con are going to run out of money. Don’t forget to have small bills for tips.  Your hotel confirmation number, just in case  Umbrella/poncho  Sunglasses  A couple of pens and Sharpies—I don’t know why this is, but you always need one and never have it.   \nIn the Room \nHow much food you pack depends on how much you want to eat in the room. Some people bring PB&J and a loaf of bread and eat it all weekend. Here’s our approach for a five-day con: \n  Breakfast bars  Cookies  Chips/pretzels  Fruit  Soda  Alcohol of choice  Plastic cups  Pitcher for mixing  Paper towels  Bottle opener, because nothing is sadder than a six-pack you can’t open  Board games—now’s a good time for that Cards Against Humanity deck you never play because there are always kids around!   \nClothes \nJust in case you aren’t actually in costume all weekend. Just in case you don’t want to ride home in a corset because you forgot actual clothes. \n  Enough clothes for the weekend—if you can’t imagine con without your favorite Batman shirt, list it specifically!  Underwear (extra underwear is never a bad idea—cons are sweaty times!)  Socks  Comfortable walking shoes  Swimsuit  Hoodie if you’re cold natured  Pajamas (just because you don’t wear any at home doesn’t mean your roommates want to see that)  Hangers for anything costume or clothing that should be hung   \nFinal Tips \n \nIf you want to be absolutely certain you’re as prepared as possible, I would read a few other lists as well. This is what I’ve found we need. You may want things we don’t care about, like an alarm clock, or have personal needs that aren’t on my list. \n \nFinally, here are a few general packing suggestions: \n  Pack folded clothes on the way there. Roll your clothes to come home, which makes them take up less space, and you can fit in your new treasures from the dealers’ room. I usually roll dirty clothes and leave any still-clean ones folded so I don’t accidentally launder clean clothes when I get home.  If you’re flying with family, spread out your clothes. If you need three suitcases for three people, that is not one suitcase per person. That is one-third of a suitcase per person, so if one goes missing, nobody’s naked.  If you have to ship to the hotel, they will usually charge you a handling fee for the box somewhere between $5 and $25, depending on which hotel and the weight of the box.  I have one costume that requires two suitcases and a Rubbermaid tub. It is an epic game of Tetris to get it in. If you have a similar situation, when you get to the hotel room, take pictures as you unpack it so you know how to get it all back in. Nobody wants to spend the last night of con trying to figure out how to get it all back home.  When I’m packing for the family, I make a chart for items that each of us need so that I can check off for each person and separate it by what goes in which suitcase. Here’s an example: \nImage credit: Ruth Suehle \n \nYou can see that in the purple bag, so far R and H have both of their formal outfits packed, but S and I do not. S has no underwear and should really get on that. S didn’t think he’d need a hoodie for this trip, so that spot is blank. Making this chart makes the list one-quarter the length compared to making each person an individual list!  Check with your roommates so you don’t end up with doubles of everything when one would be enough. Make a shared Google Doc and note who’s bringing what.   \nThe post How To Pack For A 5-Day Con appeared first on GeekMom .

(Photo: Patrick Oehler/Poughkeepsie Journal) \n\nANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON  — The Clemente Course in the Humanities offered by Bard College is one of the recipients of the 2014 National Humanities Medal and will be honored this week in a ceremony at the White House. \n\nBard College professor and Clemente Course Academic Director Marina van Zuylen will accept the award on behalf of the Clemente Course from President Obama at a White House ceremony Thursday. The ceremony will be live-streamed at 3 p.m. at www.WhiteHouse.gov/live. \n\nThe award "honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities and broadened our citizens' engagement with history, literature, languages, philosophy, and other humanities subjects," according to the National Endowment for the Humanities website. \n\nBard is joined by Oscar-winning actress Sally Field and writers Stephen King, Annie Dillard, Larry McMurtry and Jhumpa Lahiri, who will all receive arts and humanities medals from President Obama. \n\nThe Clemente Course has offered a tuition-free, college-level course in the humanities — philosophy, literature, U.S. history, art history, and critical thinking and writing — to adults living on low incomes who have limited access to college education in communities throughout the United States. \n\nClemente courses are taught by college and university professors. Books, course materials, child care and transportation are provided without charge. More than 10,000 adults have taken the Clemente Course, many of whom earned college credits and successfully continued their college education afterward, according to a release from Bard. \n\nFor the past five years, the Bard College Clemente Course has been offered at the Kingston Library. \n\n“A large number of people have continued and have gone on to college,” van Zuylen said in a release, but “I never think of ‘Clemente success’ as going on to college.” Instead, she says, it means a student who “is now solidly ready to participate” in democracy and the community and engaging with the world in a new way. “Doing something for yourself, not anyone else, reflecting on something, learning — that opens up a space inside of you.” \n\nIn the citation for the medal, the White House said the Clemente program was being honored “for improving the lives of disadvantaged adults. The Clemente Course has brought free humanities education to thousands of men and women, enriching their lives and broadening their horizons.” \n\nRead or Share this story: http://pojonews.co/1UA7pzA
0420_8e3dafb9-6cb5-443e-93ad-8cb26047537d	Gold for Gänshirt, Grayston and Chardon at FEI World Pony Driving Championships in BredaBy Associate Editor on September 6, 2015\tShareTweetShareShare0 commentsFabian Gänshirt (GER) was absolutely thrilled to secure gold at his first World Pony Singles Championship in Breda (NED) with his eight-year-old German riding pony David L. (FEI/Krisztina Horváth) Breda (NED), 6 September 2015 – Fabian Gänshirt (GER), Anna Grayston (GBR) and Bram Chardon (NED) all took world championship crowns home from Breda (NED), which was host to the seventh edition of the FEI World Driving Championships for pony singles, pairs and four-in-hands this weekend. The Dutch team claimed the gold medal for the second consecutive time. A total of 87 competitors from 16 nations fought for the honours at the Prinsenhoeve Estate, venue for the Outdoor Brabant Horse Show, with eight teams battling it out in the nations competition. It was the first time in the history of pony driving that the World Championships had been held in the Netherlands, but the choice of Breda was a natural one as this venue hosted the first ever FEI European Championships for pony four-in-hands in 1995. Unfortunately, heavy rain showers battered the competition site from the start, which affected the footing in the dressage arena as well as the marathon phases and the obstacles. New team format\nIt was the first time that the nations teams were composed differently compared to the previous World Pony Driving Championships. According to the new rules, a Nations Team is composed of 2-3 singles, 2-3 pairs, and 1-2 four-in-hands. The scores per phase of the two best singles, two pairs and one four-in-hand counts towards the team result. Singles\nFabian Gänshirt (GER), 26, finished fifth in dressage and third in the very heavy marathon to take the lead in the standings after the first two disciplines. In the final obstacle driving competition he had just a handful of time penalties and was absolutely thrilled to secure gold at his first ever World Championship. Gänshirt, who won the CAIO Minden this year with his eight-year-old German riding pony David L, was very happy: “The dressage went okay for me, but I know my pony can do better,” he said. “The atmosphere in Breda was different and caused some tension with my pony. In the marathon I started quite modest but after obstacle one went well, I started driving and fully went for it which resulted in fast times.” He felt the pressure before he went into the cones arena after Martin Hölle drove clear: “I said to myself, ‘stay cool’! This pony is unbelievable; this is only the second year that I drive him and the first season that we compete at this level.” The silver medal went to defending World Champion Martin Hölle (HUN), who competed with his World Championship pony Apache de la Licorne. Hölle won the dressage but dropped to second after the marathon in the day-long heavy rain showers. The 18-year-old student really went for it in the cones: “I came here for first place, so in the cones I felt I had nothing to lose, only something to win.” Hölle is planning to compete with a horse pair from next season but he will go on competing in the single pony class at the same time so that he can compete again in the 2017 FEI World Pony Driving Championships. Second German team member Katja Helpertz took home the bronze medal, driving her New Forest pony Nordstern´s Stoertebecker. The 23-year-old law student moved up to the third place in the standings after finishing second in the marathon. Both Hölle and Helpertz are trained by Dutch trainers. Pairs\nAfter winning bronze at the previous World Championships in Pau 2013, Anna Grayston (GBR) was finally able to finish the job in Breda and was crowned World Champion in the Pony Pairs. Grayston finished second in dressage and moved into the lead after the marathon. After second placed driver Christof Weihe (GER) left the cones arena with over 20 penalty points, Grayston, a 43-year-old carriage driving coach, had more than 15 penalty points advantage over her opponents. She knocked two balls down and had time penalties, but she wasn’t sure where she had ended up when she finished and only realised she’d won when the speaker announced it. “I didn’t know how much I had in hand so I only knew that I had won when I came out of the arena!” she said. Grayston used the same ponies in her dressage pair as at the 2009 World Championships in Greven (GER) and used one of the leaders of her pony team which she drove at the 2005 World Championships in Catton (GBR): “I haven’t used this dressage pair in Lipica or Pau. I decided to use them again because the judges like bigger paces in dressage. I sold my leader pony from Catton to one of my grooms and I got it back in February. I use it just for the marathon and with getting the pony back, I also got my groom back as back stepper in the marathon!” Dressage winner Jan-Felix Pfeffer (GER) dropped to fourth place after the marathon but as his compatriot Weihe had too many faults in the cones, the German Vice-Champion 2014 and 2015 moved up to take silver. Austria’s Stefan Bösch finished second in the marathon and moved up to bronze before the cones, holding onto the medal despite one knockdown. Four-in-hands\nBram Chardon (NED) left no room for his opponents in Breda, with the 22-year-old winning all three phases of the competition to claim his third consecutive individual gold medal. Chardon junior started well in the dressage despite the heavy footing. In the marathon he felt the breath of second placed Steffen Brauchle (GER) on his neck and decided to go for it: “I saw Brauchle in obstacle one; he took the short route and went so fast that I decided to go for it from the beginning,” Chardon said. “I had Aachen still fresh in my memory where my father IJsbrand lost it in the marathon to Steffen’s brother Michael and I didn’t want that to happen to me!” After dressage and marathon, Chardon junior had an advantage of over 23 penalty points to Brauchle, so he could take it easy, but he proved his professionalism and finished the job by putting down the only double clear round of his class, driving the same grey Welsh ponies as when he won the title in Pau (FRA) in 2013. Steffen Brauchle was the deserved silver medalist, finishing second in dressage and third in the marathon with his German riding ponies. The Belgian 21-year-old Nathan Nijs took the bronze medal after finishing second in the marathon, which he could have won but for a hiccup in the last obstacle. After dressage, in which he drove his home-produced carriage, and marathon, Nijs was in third place and held on despite two knockdowns and some time penalties.

0421_7b6f7f3b-9b52-42bd-af34-8eb113793070	Wales centre Scott Williams has underlined the defensive degree of difficulty that absent England star Jonathan Joseph would have presented in Saturday's World Cup showdown at Twickenham. \n \nDazzling runner and entertainer Joseph is set to miss the Pool A clash because of injury, with England head coach Stuart Lancaster widely expected to name rugby union rookie Sam Burgess and Brad Barritt as his midfield pairing on Thursday. \n\nWales, in contrast, will send a tried and tested centre partnership of Williams and Jamie Roberts into battle, with Saturday's winners taking a giant stride towards the quarter-finals. \n\nAsked if he preferred to defend a straight ball-carrier or someone like Joseph, Williams said: "I know which one is a lot harder to defend - Jonathan Joseph. \n\n"I wouldn't say I prefer (a straight ball-carrier) but it is a bit different. You have to make your reads if they are running hard in those lines and put in your tackles. \n\n"He (Burgess) is a big, physical player, so if he does play I am sure he will be carrying the ball hard. We've just got to make our tackles - that's the only thing I can say. \n\n"Barritt has got a lot of experience as well. It is their first time playing together but they are both world-class players. \n\n"If (Owen) Farrell plays as well, he's got a lot of experience, so it's going to be a strength for them. We're going to have to find a way through or around them. \n\n"Maybe they will try to be more direct. I am not sure if they will change much, just maybe a little bit more direct. \n\n"It hasn't changed too much about what our preparation has been. We just have to make sure we execute what we want to do correctly and hopefully that will be enough to win the game. \n\n"It's the big one, isn't it? This is the one we've been focusing on over the last month or so. I think everyone is just itching to get on the field now." \n\nReflecting on his centre combination with Roberts, Williams added: "As centres we have been together for about four years now, so we have had plenty of time to get used to each other and have played with each other quite a bit. \n\n"It is about understanding each other defensively and in attack, trying to second guess and be a step ahead of what you think the inside centre or outside centre is going to do. \n\n"I like to think in the last couple of games we have shown different areas that we can attack and mix things up, so I am sure we will be mixing things up at the weekend."
0422_1fd5c0e0-7d2f-46d4-b99a-59c548bc7536	AS a town, Rotherham has been kicked in the teeth too many times to mention in recent years – and now it is the turn of its football team to be in the dock.\n\nOr, more especially, in the words of Steve Evans, it’s proud manager and chairman, with the Millers enduring their toughest time since Tony Stewart made the judicious decision to appoint the Scot in April, 2012.\n\nBack-to-back promotions and preserving their Championship status represents impeccable form in the course of three progressive campaigns. \n\nBut in the oscillating knee-jerk world of football where the memory span of many supporters is shorter than it has ever been regarding results, the Millers, in the view of Evans, are now facing a chargesheet.\n\nThey head into this afternoon’s Championship home game with Cardiff City without a league win this term along with three other Football League sides – Blackburn Rovers, Crewe Alexandra and Newport County – and propping up their division.\n\nThe Millers’ disappointing sequence has led some fans to start openly questioning Evans, but with the season still in its relative infancy and armed with the benefit of the history of the past few seasons when the club has held its nerve in tense times, the 52-year-old is bullish regarding the prospect of a fightback.\n\nAs in the words of the famous Tubthumping song from Chumbawamba, if you knock Evans down, he will get up again, while vowing that Rotherham United will continue to prove a ‘beacon of light’ for the derided South Yorkshire town.\n\nOffering trademark defiance, manager Evans said: “We are almost in a courtroom situation, where Tony Stewart and Steve Evans are in the dock getting judged by the jury and the jury is our supporters. \n\n“If the evidence had been judged halfway through League Two and League One, me and Tony would have been sent down. If it had been this January, it is fair to say we’d be down again. \n\n“But, as the chairman said, there’s a lot of evidence to come out of Rotherham United.\n\n“After six or seven games to be saying this and that is disrespectful to what we have achieved in three-and-a-half-years really. \n\n“We sit here four points behind half the league and yet we don’t know what we are doing. We have got little points to prove.\n\n“Don’t people think Steve Evans and Tony Stewart aren’t fighters and haven’t got pride and determination? \n\n“Do they think if we get down, we don’t get back up again? We are the leaders of that in Rotherham United. \n\n“Our club has been the only beacon of light in Rotherham for three-and-a-half years. That beacon of light is not going to go out, that’s for sure.”\n\nEvans is the first to acknowledge that the Millers’ start has been far from what everyone associated with the club hoped for, but equally, he believes that his side remain just fine margins away from removing the winless Championship millstone from their backs in 2015-16.\n\nTwo sound enough away shows at Charlton and Brighton, without a surfeit of points, justify that assumption, with Evans mindful of how the restorative benefits of one win can change the Championship complexion entirely.\n\nHe said: “Sometimes you read things that annoy you a bit. I have read that a couple of clubs have made great and steady starts and they are three points in front of us. \n\n“One report I read said ours is a shocking start and it’s only three points behind one who have had a steady start...\n\n“You set objectives at the start of the season. The first clean sheet, goal and point we have. We just need to get our first win to get off and running. You have to dig in and be determined.\n\n“The large majority of supporters – and I meet many on a daily basis – speak about the remarkable progress we have made. \n\n“But we don’t want it to be for nothing and don’t want to be back in the same league as Sheffield United and Doncaster Rovers and Chesterfield. We don’t want to be in League One and must do what we can to stay in this Championship.”\n\nEvans’s stock-in trade is winning and he prides himself on possessing that winning mentality, with those traits manifested not just at Rotherham, but also earlier in his managerial career. \n\nIf it means making a few enemies on the way, so be it.\n\nGiven his side’s recent dearth, the Millers chief is ravenous in his desire to reacquaint himself with that winning feeling which all his week’s work strives towards – with the ‘supporter’ in him also understanding fans’ craving for that sensation, too, and what they expect as a bare minimum if that does not happen. \n\nHe added: “The majority of supporters are with us every step of the way and I want to win matches more than anyone in the world. I want to get back to that winning feeling. \n\n“I read some quotes attributed to Jose Mourinho this week and he says he’d forgotten what it felt like to win until he won in the Champions League. That is what it feels like as a manager.\n\n“But if you are a football supporter, you want to win matches. I can relate to that as I am a supporter of Glasgow Celtic. \n\n“And if I turn up to games, I don’t care if we are playing Real Madrid or Barcelona, Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea; I want my team to compete. \n\n“That’s what our supporters demand. They can accept if we lose if we have a go as they are honest and genuine people. \n\n“And in the first two or three games at home, they probably feel we haven’t had a go. And I can understand that. \n\n“But we believe we can beat anyone at New York Stadium, even though we have a track record that says it doesn’t always happen. But we have won more than lost and had great occasions.”
0423_5427c34e-626f-43da-84a0-e8884145b204	 \nKOTZEBUE — President Barack Obama brought no grand policy pronouncements, new legislative proposals or major tranches of federal aid with him to Alaska. Instead, he sought to use the power of his own celebrity to command attention to the issue of climate change. \n\nClosing out his Alaska tour with a trip Wednesday to the tiny town of Kotzebue, Obama became the first sitting president to set foot in the Alaska Arctic, a fact the White House hoped would illustrate a commitment to Alaska's endangered landscape beyond that of his predecessors. Yet he also walked a fine line in a state that's deeply dependent on energy revenues and wary of his efforts to keep its oil and gas in the ground. \n\n"I've been trying to make the rest of the country more aware of a changing climate, but you're already living it," Obama told some 1,000 Alaskans in this rough-and-tumble town 26 miles north of the Arctic Circle. \n\nFor most of his presidency, Obama has seemed reluctant to indulge the celebrity status that comes with his job. He's spoken frankly about his aversion to being followed around constantly by throngs of journalists more interested in capturing dramatic moments than chronicling whatever policy issue is atop his agenda. \n\nOn this trip, dramatic moments were the whole point. \n\nAs he crisscrossed the state, every stop was elaborately staged to showcase the president in front of picture-perfect natural wonders, as the White House sought to attract as much media attention as possible. Obama seemed willing to use himself almost as a prop, in hopes that his message on global warming might break through in ways that speeches and policy proposals don't. \n\nIn Seward, he trekked up to the famed Exit Glacier, lamenting how the expansive river of ice had receded by hundreds of feet in recent years as it melts under warmer temperatures. He boarded a boat for a three-hour tour of Resurrection Bay in the Kenai Peninsula, where the White House arranged for photographers and reporters to pull up alongside him in a separate boat, capturing stirring images of the president gazing out wistfully from the deck at serene waters and lush mountain vistas. \n\nHe stood in the rain and dawned thick gloves in Dillingham to hold up silver salmon caught in Bristol Bay, where local fishermen are locked in a dispute with developers over plans to build a copper and gold mine that environmentalists say threaten a world-renowned salmon fishery. And as he flew to the Alaska Arctic, Obama directed Air Force One to descend so he could get a closer look at Kivalina, a village of 400 on a sliver of barrier island that's sinking into the water as sea levels rise. \n\n"Think about it," Obama said. "If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we'd do everything in our power to protect it." \n\nThe three-day trip to Alaska marked Obama's most concerted campaign yet to call attention to climate change and build pressure on individuals and leaders to do something about it. Just three months from now, Obama and world leaders hope to finalize a global climate treaty in Paris that Obama hopes will be a crowning achievement for his environmental legacy. \n\nYet Obama's previous calls to action on climate change have fallen short of winning over many of his critics, including energy advocates who say his sweeping new emissions limits on p…
0424_c60d0a5d-e039-4654-aa2f-c43f35e66572	United States judge allows lawsuit by Uber drivers who claim they are employees, not contractors, and deserve benefits. \nA US federal court judge has granted class-action status to court cases filed by Uber drivers who are claiming benefits from the company on the basis that they have been treated like employees but only paid as contractors. \n \nThe original suit, O'Connor v Uber Technologies, involved just four drivers who sued Uber in 2013 for reimbursement of certain expenses including petrol and vehicle maintenance. \n \nHowever, a decision on Tuesday by Judge Edward Chen of the US District Court in San Francisco has reportedly opened the case to as many as 160,000 current and former Uber drivers who have worked for the company in California. \n       \n   \nUber, in a statement on Tuesday, denied that the case would affect as many drivers, and said that only a few hundred drivers would be able to participate in the action. \n \n"This is because the ruling found that only drivers who either stopped driving before June 2014 or drove after June 2014 but chose to opt out of the arbitration option in their agreements, are eligible," Abby Horrigan, the managing counsel for employment at Uber said in a statement on the group's website. \n \n"Before June 2014, our business in California was mostly UberBLACK, primarily drivers who work for limo companies: they cannot be part of the case. This is because the court has ruled that those drivers never had a contract directly with Uber. Individuals who registered with Uber as a corporation also cannot participate in the class," the statement said. \n \nAn Uber spokesperson told the AFP news agency that the company would "most likely appeal the decision as partners use Uber on their own terms and there really is no typical driver - the key question at issue". \n \nHowever, the case could have broad implications for the "sharing" economy, which is currently based on independent contractors earning money through web-based services that offer them little or no employment protections like pension contributions or health insurance. \n \n"This case is going to have a major effect on not just Uber but all these businesses and business models," Saint Louis University law professor Miriam Cherry told the tech news website Ars Technica. \n \nIn a separate case in June, a California labour board ruled that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor. But that ruling applied only to that single driver. \n \nDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton also said recently she would "crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors". \n \n"This on-demand, or so-called gig economy, is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation," Clinton said in June. \n \n"But it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future." \n\nSource:   Al Jazeera and agencies

0426_90903bea-542f-420c-b8e8-d7d870f7e62c	Yesterday was the last day of Summer 2015.  However, I do believe that most people have already said goodbye to Summer.  I’ve said this before, but I believe that most people feel as if the kids returning back to school at the end of August OR Labor Day in early September is the (unofficial) end of Summer.  But, nope.  It was yesterday.  That means that today is the first day of Fall 2015. \n \nI think that my outfit from yesterday is very Fall appropriate: green, tan, and brown.  Over the weekend I was feeling very inspired and creative and I composed several outfits to wear in the coming week(s).  This happens to be one of them.  It also happens to feature the 2nd new blouse that I purchased at JCP in late August.  I’ve paired this green sleeveless silky blouse with a dark brown skirt.  I love the pleats in this skirt– it reminds me of way back when I was a cheerleader.  This pleated skirt is much more professional, though.  I toyed around with the idea of an oatmeal or a brown cardigan but ultimately decided to go with the khaki blazer.  The sleeves of this blazer have a cream and tan striped lining, but I opted to unroll the sleeves completely for this look.  I also had a few different shoe options. \n \nI tried my nude pumps to tie in the lighter colored blazer and I liked the look, but I didn’t love it.  I also tried my faux leopard printed pumps.  Those were my favorite but as I took a closer look I realized that it may be time to retire those shoes–they were looking shabby.  Then, I tried a darker shoe option for cohesiveness with the dark brown skirt.  I have already worn my brown round-toe pumps so I was trying not to go that direction.  I went with the pointy-toed brown pumps.  Later, I switched into leopard print flats.  (grin.) \n \nSince I wore my hair flat-ironed straight, I opted to go with gold swirly earrings.  I also chose a long gold necklace.  I had also tried a shorter green necklace that looked great, but it wasn’t long enough.  I have several necklace extenders but I couldn’t find any of them and I was starting to run out of time to get ready in the morning so I had to go with what was easier.  I like the completed look, though. \n \nI had a busy and rough day yesterday.  I started with my 9 am class and then met with a student for 15 minutes after class for one-on-one instruction.  I had to go directly from that location to a meeting at noon.  I arrived 20 minutes early and was hoping that I could meet with 1 of the 3 people who I needed to talk with during my visit, but no luck.  One was in a meeting, another was out to lunch, and the third one was out of the building.  After my meeting I came home and had lunch while I talked with my Dad and Sister, respectively. I also tore my house apart looking for a piece of important information that I had scrawled down back in August to no avail. \n \nI spent much of the afternoon grading and prepping for my evening class.  It wasn’t long before it was time to get re-dressed, pack my dinner, and head to my evening class.  It doesn’t start until 7:30 but I like to be on-campus around 6 pm.  This gives me ample time to figure out what items I need to send to the copy center, prepare the next day lecture, grade papers, meet with students, etc.  After class, I met with several of my students to answer individual questions and spent about 20 minutes helping one student with their homework assignment. \n \nI was exhausted. \n \nOn the drive home I called my husband to hear about his day– he attended a special training session off-site.  His phone battery was very low, so we weren’t able to talk for long.  Once I was home we traded stories about our days and then watched 2 seconds of TV before brushing teeth and collapsing in bed. \n \n-Carla

0428_6292cddd-4c2d-4c79-97dd-15c482140a4c	Sydney's Sam Reid is contributing to the scoreboard. Photo: Michael Dodge  \n  \nYou'd have thought the football world might have wised up after a decade or so, but once again Sydney might have pulled off the season's greatest confidence trick. \n\nOn the eve of the finals, the Swans are as well-positioned as ever for a genuine tilt at a premiership, a top-four spot secured should they dispense with Gold Coast on Saturday. And yet again, they've done it without anyone really noticing. \n\nIt's become a recurring theme, but in 2015, a sleight of hand executed with even more panache than usual. \n\nThe Swans had their usual quota of impressive early season wins, then dropped enough games to raise a few doubts. The rebound that followed was hardly spectacular. Then came a loss to Richmond, and in successive weeks, thrashings at the hands of Hawthorn and West Coast. \n \nSydney's flag chances ballooned out to $11 only a couple of weeks ago, and they're still at a longer price than Hawthorn, West Coast or Fremantle. \n\nOnly the desperately foolish won't be giving Sydney a decent shot of pulling off a finals upset when they take on Fremantle in Perth next week. For this is familiar turf indeed. \n\nThree times already in the 2000s, the Swans have managed to win qualifying finals on the road against heavily favoured opponents. They did it against Adelaide three years ago en route to a flag, against West Coast in 2006, and against Port Adelaide in 2003. \n\nBut this is also about a lot more than hunches and history. It's about the Swans' very effective addressing of issues that only a month ago seemed destined to have them playing the role of finals also-ran. \n\nSydney could manage only seven goals in each of those pummelings at the hands of Hawthorn and West Coast. A fortnight later, against Geelong, they kicked just nine. But the road to scoreboard redemption has been rapid and ominous. \n\nThe Swans' 20-goal tallies in each of their past two wins over Greater Western Sydney and St Kilda were by some margin their highest scores of the season. In round 17, against Adelaide, they booted 17. And it's where the goals are coming from that is no less significant. \n\nTo be able to compete with the likes of the Hawks and Eagles, coach John Longmire simply had to make the Swans' forward set-up more multi-dimensional. He's managed to do so with some impact. \n\nAfter the round 17 loss in Perth, Sydney ranked a dismal 11th for points scored and an even more lowly 13th for number of individual goalkickers per game. In the five games since, the Swans have stood second for points scored and are outright leader for numbers of goalkickers, having averaged more than nine per game. \n\nThe scoreboard impact statistic (both points scored and assisted) is a very good gauge here. \n\nAfter 17 rounds, Sydney had just four players – Lance Franklin, Kurt Tippett, Ben McGlynn and Isaac Heeney – averaging double figures for the statistic, and McGlynn and Heeney's numbers were based on small-game samples. \n\nIn the last five games, however, no fewer than 10 Swans have managed double-figure tallies. Franklin, leader for scoreboard impact over both periods, has a lower tally for rounds 18-22 than previously, but the more even contribution to the scoreboard now has Sam Reid and Jarrad McVeigh featuring prominently, while Kieren Jack and Tom Mitchell have both doubled their output. \n\nSydney have cleaned up their efficiency in the forward 50, are clunking a lot more marks (their ranking having jumped from 11th to second) and are scoring a lot more points from forward line stoppages. \n\nIn terms of player availability, things look a lot healthier, too. Franklin and Gary Rohan returned last week, McGlynn is a chance to play only his second senior game since round nine, and even Luke Parker, all but discounted after breaking his fibula, has his cast off and is an outside chance to play in week two of the finals. \n\nAfter what at times has been a difficult season, the planets appear to be aligning once again for the Swans. The question remains, though, why should we be surprised? It is September, after all, and when it comes to football in spring, Sydney is just another byword.
0429_81e98350-4707-49c2-9c3e-4461c97954b8	Narrabundah's hardy peacocks still rule the roost in the divided neighbourhood. \n\nEach spring in Narrabundah, several residents decide whether to protect or hunt from their gardens nesting peafowl.\n\nRetired resident Geoffrey Dabb, who has photographed birds around the world since his teens, has observed the peafowls for decades, including "Harry", who was killed by "a hoon driver who mounted the kerb". Old Harry had mated before his death, and his offspring endure.\n\nMr Dabb says most of the flock of about 18 peafowl seem about two years old and not fully mature. Few chicks were born last season, or the one before, he said.\n\nHe expects adults are breeding in neighbours' gardens that don't have dogs. "So you see these tiny little chicks wandering around after the mother. Any one who had them in their garden breeding would know about it probably. If they didn't like them, they could destroy the eggs or move them on."\n\nThe ACT government spent $10,000 trapping and relocating eight peafowl in 2013 to Taronga Western Plains Zoo, after some residents complained about their noisy calls, poo on the footpath and garden scratchings.\n\nWhile the government refused to relocate any of them to willing rural residents in the capital region, for fear of spreading the population, the two peahens sent to the zoo were later rehomed to a bird enthusiast's place within Dubbo shire.\n\nThe six peacocks are free ranging within the zoo. "They have taken up their own territories including in the free visitor area, near the elephants, around the Asian Forest area and near the administration office," a spokeswoman says.\n\n"The birds are in good health, and don't leave the zoo. They are appreciated by Taronga Western Plains Zoo's visitors," she said. "No, they haven't had their wings clipped, peacocks only like to fly short distances."\n\nMr Dabb is unsure from where the birds originated. Most likely they came from a rural leaseholder to the Narrabundah long-stay caravan park, from where they were chased by dogs until they moved elsewhere into the suburb.\n\nA white peahen became a neighbourhood celebrity. "I used to call it White-ney Houston, it lasted a couple of years, and was sitting on eggs in someone's front yard and a fox got it and tore it to pieces," Mr Dabb said. Other residents called it Doris.\n\nFoxes have culled Pialligo's peafowl that were introduced years ago by neighbours of Willow Park Nursery. Nursery worker Daniel Nikulin says the peacocks adopted Willow Park as their home, and now numbered five or six.\n\nHe said the nursery's owner had brought in a clutch of chicks this year to complement the older ones.\n\n"They do tend to gravitate around the nursery, it's nice open space for them. They cross the road as well and get around. The kids love them," Mr Nikulin said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

It was there when he moved in five years ago. \n \nThe previous owner really planted it too close to the house. If they would’ve kept a close eye on it and pruned it when necessary, it probably would’ve been fine. \n \nBut it got WAAAY out of control… \n \nPhoto taken September 3, 2013 \n \nSo, I thought it would be a good idea to trim this thing way back and track its progress as it grows back. We decided to wait until March before the tree came out of dormancy. \n \nHere are a few shots of the tree before we trimmed it… \n \nPhotos taken March 10, 2014 \n \nNow it was time to get to work! We skipped right over the hedge shears and lopping shears and went right for the trusty ol’ chainsaw! \n \nI can already hear you gasping. Trust me, I know what I’m doing. \n \n20 minutes later, we were done… \n \nPhotos taken March 10, 2014 \n \nAs you can imagine, Duston heard it from his wife, his neighbors and the in-laws. “What did you do?! Is it dead?! Did you kill it?! Why in the world did you do that?!” \n \nEveryone fails to see it as a work in progress and can’t even think about what the end result will look like once it grows back. That’s why you see so many overgrown Japanese Maples… people are too afraid to touch them for fear of killing it or hearing about it from everyone and their brother. \n \nDon’t be afraid to trim your overgrown Japanese Maple way back!! Take a look at the tree now… \n \nPhoto taken September 4, 2015 \n \nAlmost 18 months later and the tree looks beautiful! It almost looks healthier than before. Duston has since kept it tightly trimmed, allowing it to get full in the center. \n \n\n \nIf you’d like to know how to keep your smaller Japanese Maples from getting overgrown like this one, watch the 10-minute video I made below…

"He told our friends that there was a 'misunderstanding' between us, but there’s no way I told him he could go ahead and make $2,000 for himself." \n \nTrustedHousesitters removed the offending (though entrepreneurial!) housesitter's profile from the site, and Airbnb banned that person's profile as well. The couple is also pursuing a civil lawsuit against the housesitter.  \n \n"We have zero tolerance for this sort of fraudulent activity," Airbnb told Business Insider in a statement.  \n \nTrustedHousesitter told The Guardian that because the couple didn't use its on-site messaging tool to reach out the the housesitter, it was harder to investigate the complaint beyond deleting the profile.   \n \nThe couple, for their part, said that next time they'll just recruit some friends to look after their apartment.   \n   SEE ALSO:  From fireworks to jousting, these these 13 tech execs have some weird and awesome hobbies      NOW WATCH: There is a secret US government airline that flies out of commercial airports     Please enable Javascript to watch this video
0432_86f31047-e26f-4f4c-bf6c-77ba8a85dcdf	The Maine Ethics Commission staff is proposing new campaign finance requirements for organizations, including many from out of state, that funnel huge sums of money into Maine elections but are not required to disclose their donors. \n \nThe proposed changes, which will be discussed next week, are designed to shed light on who is funding groups from all parts of the political spectrum that are playing an increasingly prominent role in hotly contested elections and ballot questions in Maine. During the November 2014 election, for instance, five national groups spent or donated more than $13 million to sway voters on the race for governor and the referendum over bear hunting. \n \nWhile the organizations – the Democratic Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association, the Humane Society of the United States, NextGen Climate Action Committee and the League of Conservation Voters – were required to report how much money they spent in Maine, they are not required under current law to spell out the origins of that money. \n \nEthics commission staff wrote in a memo outlining the proposal that, while none of the groups violated Maine’s campaign finance laws, “a weakness in the law … allows organizations to spend large amounts of money in Maine with no obligation to provide Maine voters with any information about the sources of their income.” \n \n“We are trying to raise awareness that Maine election law is not working as well as it could to provide information to Maine voters and to the election system,” Jonathan Wayne, executive director of the Maine Ethics Commission, said Friday. “But this is really just a beginning point of the discussion.” \n \nUnder current law, the majority of political action committees, or PACs, operating in Maine are created specifically to influence elections and must disclose the identities of individuals or organizations that donate $50 or more. The donor disclosure rules are different, however, for multipurpose organizations involved in political campaigns in other states – such as the national party committees – or that also focus on activities outside of elections. \n \nOftentimes, such “outside groups” create PACs or ballot question committees in order to spend money on Maine races, but are not required to reveal the identity of most donors because the money comes from the organization’s general treasury. \n \nEthics commission staff is proposing legislation that would require political action committees and ballot question committees “whose primary focus is something other than influencing Maine elections” to report donor information if the organizations spend more than $5,000 on either candidate elections or referendums in Maine. The bill lays out a complex set of criteria for when disclosures would be required. \n \nAndrew Bossie, executive director of the non-partisan Maine Citizens for Clean Elections group that is active on campaign finance issues, said the proposal would help keep voters informed as the nature of election funding changes. \n \n“What we are seeing here is a loophole that is being used by both sides” as they shield donor identities, Bossie said. “There is a need for fair debate and every Maine citizen has a right to know where campaign money is coming from and who is trying to influence our votes.” \n \nThe five-member Maine Ethics Commission will consider the staff proposal next Thursday and, if approved, would send the proposal to the Legislature for possible consideration. The request comes as Bossie and other leaders of Mainers for Accountable Elections spearhead the campaign for Question 1 on this November’s ballot. That referendum would increase funding for Maine’s public campaign financing system used by candidates, stiffen penalties for campaign finance violations and require organizations to disclose the three top donors on political ads. \n \nThe Ethics Commission proposal comes two months after the agency, which oversees the state’s campaign finance laws, won a years-long legal battle to force the National Organization for Marriage to disclose the names of individuals who bankrolled much of the successful 2009 campaign to fight same-sex marriage in Maine. Although the NOM case centered on a separate issue – namely whether the organization should have registered as a ballot question committee in Maine – the proposed campaign finance changes are consistent with the ethics commission’s focus on broader donor disclosure. \n \nBut Wayne said the proposal is more a response to the growing trend, in Maine and nationally, about how elections are financed by outside groups. The issue has been on the commission’s agenda for some time, yet gained urgency after staff reviewed spending trends during the 2014 election. In fact, 2014 was the first year that outside groups spent more to influence Maine voters in the top race than the candidates themselves. \n \nOutside groups spent more than $10 million to influence voters in the race for governor or State House races last year, eclipsing previous spending levels by so-called “independent organizations.” \n \nThe Republican Governors Association funneled $5.1 million into a local political action committee dubbed the RGA Maine PAC in order to help Gov. Paul LePage win re-election. Likewise, the Democratic Governors Association directed $3 million into the organizations Democratic Governors Association PAC and Maine Forward in an effort to defeat LePage and elect former U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud. The League of Conservation Voters and NextGen Climate Action Committee funneled a combined $3.5 million into Maine, largely to defeat LePage. \n \nThe Humane Society of the United States and the organization’s legislative fund, meanwhile, gave $2.1 million to Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting as part of the contentious but unsuccessful campaign to prohibit hunting bears with bait or dogs. \n \n“Different states are encountering the same problem and are trying to find a solution to the issue,” said Wayne, adding that aspects of the commission’s proposal are modeled after laws on the books in California and other states. \n \n“We think the Maine public deserves more information than they are getting now about how Maine elections are financed.” \n \nJason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party, had not yet read the commission staff’s proposal but indicated that the party generally supports transparency efforts as long as they are applied equitably to all organizations. \n \n“Transparency is really good for the Maine political world,” Savage said. “We support efforts to increase transparency.” \n \nLikewise, Maine Democratic Party spokeswoman Rachel Irwin said officials were reviewing the proposal, but added, “We are supportive of efforts to increase transparency in campaign finance.” \n \nKevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: \n \nkmiller@mainetoday.com \n \nTwitter: @KevinMillerPPH
0433_978851cd-048f-416f-9210-f367806b9822	Nathan Dyer's brave late header completed a remarkable comeback by Leicester as they climbed to second place in the Barclays Premier League table with a 3-2 home win against Aston Villa. \n \nThe Foxes looked like losing their unbeaten start to the season after a couple of wonderful curling efforts from Jack Grealish, his first goal for Villa, and Carles Gil put the visitors in the driving seat. \n \nBut goals from Ritchie De Laet, whose effort was given with the aid of goal-line technology, Jamie Vardy and substitute Dyer, making his debut following his loan arrival from Swansea during the international break, saw Claudio Ranieri's men snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. \n \nWinger Dyer remained on the floor for a couple of minutes after clattering into goalkeeper Brad Guzan when heading the 89th-minute clincher,  but eventually got to his feet to take the acclaim. \n \nThere was a let-off for Leicester early on when  Gil sent Gabriel Agbonlahor racing clear and his low cross to the far post was just beyond the reach of Scott Sinclair, who at full stretch poked the ball wide. \n \nThe Foxes also had an early chance when Wes Morgan shrugged off Jordan Amavi to meet Marc Albrighton's cross but powered his header over the crossbar. \n \nGrealish spurned a terrific chance to give Villa the lead in the 24th minute when he  steered his shot straight at Kasper Schmeichel. But when presented with a similar opportunity just before half-time, the youngster did not make the same error. \n \nLeicester struggled to clear a corner and the ball bobbled around a crowded penalty area before breaking to the edge of the box where Grealish curled home a lovely right-footed shot beyond a possibly unsighted Schmeichel. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe sheer joy on Grealish's face was there for all to see as he ran towards his manager Tim Sherwood. He had longed for that first goal for the club since he was a child playing football round the back of the Aston Social Club in the shadow of Villa Park. \n \nLeicester emerged for the second half full of vigour. Jeff Schlupp burst into the box and cut the ball back for Vardy whose instinctive back-heel flick rolled narrowly wide. \n \nVardy then raced clear into the area but Micah Richards remained with him and got a crucial block on the striker's shot. \n \nIt was somewhat against the run of play when Villa extended their lead in the 63rd minute.  Agbonlahor broke free down the left and played a square pass to Gil who guided a lovely curling shot around defender Robert Huth and back into the top corner of the net from 22 yards. \n \nMidway through the second half Leicester had a big shout for a penalty turned down by referee Mike Dean when Vardy's burst into the box was halted by Leandro Bacuna. \n \nShortly afterwards De Laet halved Leicester's deficit. His near-post flick from Riyad Mahrez's corner looked like it might have been headed safely off the line by Ashley Westwood but goal-line technology alerted Dean that the ball had crossed. \n \nVardy then sent a shot into the side-netting as Leicester sensed they could still get something from the game. \n \nThey were right - they could. Mahrez's mazy run forward set up Danny Drinkwater and his low cross was poked home by Vardy with eight minutes still to play. \n \nThe pressure on Villa was relentless and Dyer, on at half-time for Shinji Okazaki, immediately endeared himself to Foxes fans when he bravely got between two Villa defenders to head home before running into Guzan. \n \nMahrez almost added some gloss to the scoreline, which would have been harsh on Villa, with a curling effort which flew narrowly wide. \n \nTWEET OF THE MATCH: \n \n"What a team. What a display. What a fightback. #COYF" - former Leicester striker Gary Lineker seemed to be pleased after the 3-2 win. \n \nhttps://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/643106014745763841 \n \nPLAYER RATINGS \n \nLeicester \n \nKasper Schmeichel: 6/10 \n \nRitchie De Laet: 7 \n \nRobert Huth: 6 \n \nWes Morgan: 6 \n \nJeff Schlupp: 6 \n \nMarc Albrighton: 6 \n \nDanny Drinkwater: 7 \n \nGokhan Inler: 6 \n \nRiyad Mahrez: 8 \n \nShinji Okazaki: 5 \n \nJamie Vardy: 7 \n \nSubs \n \nNathan Dyer: 7 \n \nLeonardo Ulloa: 5 \n \nNgolo Kante: 7 \n \nAston Villa \n \nBradley Guzan: 6 \n \nLeandro Bacuna: 6 \n \nMicah Richards: 7 \n \nJoleon Lescott: 6 \n \nJordan Amavi: 5 \n \nCarlos Sanchez: 5 \n \nAshley Westwood: 6 \n \nCarles Gil: 7 \n \nJack Grealish: 7 \n \nScott Sinclair: 6 \n \nGabriel Agbonlahor: 6 \n \nSubs \n \nJordan Ayew: 4 \n \nRudy Gestede: 4 \n \nAlan Hutton: 3 \n \nSTAR PLAYER \n \nRiyad Mahrez. He was a constant thorn in Villa's side all afternoon with his pace, quick feet and trickery and was pivotal in dragging Leicester back from the brink. The Algeria international has been a joy to watch so far this season. \n \nMOMENT OF THE MATCH \n \nJack Grealish's goal. What a moment for the young man. Took the chance with the composure of a seasoned pro - just three days after his 20th birthday. Perfect placement, textbook technique and sufficient power and fade. Shame for him that in the end it was not worth any points. \n \nVIEW FROM THE BENCH \n \nGabriel Agbonlahor's inclusion was a bit of a surprise but presumably Tim Sherwood wanted to use his pace against Robert Huth and Wes Morgan. Behind him, Villa's attacking trio of Scott Sinclair, Grealish and Carles Gil rotated well and caused Leicester problems. \n \nHowever, Claudio Ranieri replaced Shinji Okazaki with debutant Nathan Dyer at half-time, moving Mahrez into a more central position, and the Algerian was instrumental in the hosts rescuing their unbeaten start to the season. \n \nMOAN OF THE MATCH \n \nMahrez again. The only blot on the 24-year-old's copybook when in the 82nd minute he appeared to roll on the floor in an attempt to get Jordan Amavi a second yellow card. \n \nWHO'S UP NEXT? \n   \n Share article  \n   \nStoke v Leicester (Premier League, September 19) \n \nAston Villa v West Brom (Premier League, September 19)
0434_9d0c46e6-798e-4168-9ca7-6bda3fc9269b	Arenado is a better hitter at home, but... isn't everyone? \nWelcome to the 24th Purple Row edition (and 129th overall) of Tuesdays With Mitch, where we always sprint up the line on lazy pop flies. Let's get into it...\n\nNolan Arenado is having a spectacular, breakout season. Transcendent defense. Explosive offense. It's been a treat to watch all year long. However, I've grown frustrated with what has often been the national response to Arenado's year, in which we are implored to LOOK AT HIS HOME AND ROAD SPLITS, BRO! HE PLAYS AT COORS FIELD!\n\nYes, he does. And yes, Coors Field is a great hitter's park. I'm not here to dispute either of those facts. How much better are Arenado's home numbers compared to his numbers on the road? Let's look. Here are Arenado's splits:\nNOLAN ARENADO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n310\n\n\n.316\n\n\n.350\n\n\n.610\n\n\n.960\n\n\n23\n\n\n20\n\n\n189\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n284\n\n\n.250\n\n\n.285\n\n\n.525\n\n\n.810\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSo yeah, he definitely has better numbers at home than on the road. No doubt about it. Batting average is 66 points higher. Slugging percentage is 85 points higher. Nolan Arenado is a better hitter in his home ball park than he is on the road. This should diminish the quality of his season, right? Well, on Sunday afternoon Rockies' broadcaster Drew Goodman brought up some interesting numbers regarding how some of baseball's other great players perform in their home parks, and I want to dive into that further.\n\nSurely, the other great players in baseball will have much more even, perhaps almost identical numbers hitting at home as they do on the road. After all, they don't play half of their games at Coors Field. At least this seems to be the theory of those who are quick to discount the accomplishments of successful Rockies hitters.\n\nSo I pulled the numbers for the best hitters in baseball this year, all players who will surely receive some MVP votes. Now, keep in mind I'm not attempting to compare these players' seasons to Arenado's, nor am I attempting to prove that Coors Field isn't a great hitter's park. Just checking out some home/road numbers for a bunch of really good hitters.\nBRYCE HARPER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n255\n\n\n.345\n\n\n.488\n\n\n.682\n\n\n1.170\n\n\n17\n\n\n23\n\n\n174\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n248\n\n\n.327\n\n\n.444\n\n\n.633\n\n\n1.078\n\n\n20\n\n\n18\n\n\n157\n\n\n\n\n \nSo, it would appear that Bryce Harper is another player who enjoys hitting at his home ball park more than he does on the road. His slugging percentage is 50 points higher. The OPS is 92 points higher. He's got five more homers in his familiar digs. (Related:  Holy crap, what a year he's having. Those numbers are unbelievable. Nothing new, but wow.) Let's check out the other MVP...\nJOSH DONALDSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n312\n\n\n.330\n\n\n.398\n\n\n.647\n\n\n1.046\n\n\n25\n\n\n24\n\n\n202\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n291\n\n\n.265\n\n\n.344\n\n\n.498\n\n\n.843\n\n\n15\n\n\n17\n\n\n145\n\n\n\n\n \nWell that's interesting. It would appear that Josh Donaldson is another player who enjoys hitting at his home ball park more than he does on the road. Dramatically. Across the board, every statistic for Josh Donaldson is greatly enhanced when he's playing at home. His OPS is 203 points higher in the Rogers Center (or Centre).\nANDREW McCUTCHEN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n265\n\n\n.332\n\n\n.430\n\n\n.543\n\n\n.974\n\n\n20\n\n\n12\n\n\n144\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n282\n\n\n.255\n\n\n.381\n\n\n.440\n\n\n.821\n\n\n16\n\n\n10\n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n \nWould you look at that! It would appear that Andrew McCutchen is another player who enjoys hitting at his home ball park more than he does on the road. McCutchen's splits are also dramatic and across the board. Perhaps most notable is the 77 point difference in batting average.\nMIGUEL CABRERA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n269\n\n\n.357\n\n\n.457\n\n\n.540\n\n\n.997\n\n\n18\n\n\n7\n\n\n121\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n234\n\n\n.313\n\n\n.419\n\n\n.515\n\n\n.934\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou're not going to believe this, but it would appear that Miguel Cabrera is another player who enjoys hitting at his home ball park more than he does on the road. Cabrera's missed quite a bit of time this year, so his power numbers are down, but he's still logged over 500 at-bats. He's got a few more dingers on the road, but like Arenado, every other category looks better at home.\nPAUL GOLDSCHMIDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n245\n\n\n.331\n\n\n.475\n\n\n.567\n\n\n1.042\n\n\n21\n\n\n11\n\n\n139\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n303\n\n\n.304\n\n\n.391\n\n\n.551\n\n\n.943\n\n\n15\n\n\n20\n\n\n167\n\n\n\n\n \nWe'll I'll be danged! It would appear that Paul Goldschmidt is another player who enjoys hitting at his home ball park more than he does on the road. Outside of hitting two-thirds of his homers on the road, Goldschmidt's average, on-base, and slugging (somehow) are all notably higher at Chase Field than elsewhere.\nNow, there are exceptions to most rules, and not every player fits the mold. I was able to find a couple elite players who have put up better numbers on the road this year.\nJOEY VOTTO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n338\n\n\n.301\n\n\n.479\n\n\n.518\n\n\n.997\n\n\n10\n\n\n14\n\n\n129\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n276\n\n\n.333\n\n\n.449\n\n\n.587\n\n\n1.036\n\n\n23\n\n\n15\n\n\n162\n\n\n\n\n \nVotto's numbers really surprised me, considering Great American Ball Park is essentially a Little League field that grown men play in. But over the course of his odd, tremendous year (an astounding .553 OBP in the second half), Votto has consistently put up better numbers away from home.\nMIKE TROUT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\nAVG\n\n\nOBP\n\n\nSLG\n\n\nOPS\n\n\n2B\n\n\nHR\n\n\nTB\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n271\n\n.273\n\n\n.394\n\n\n.539\n\n\n.933\n\n\n11\n\n\n19\n\n\n146\n\n\n\n\nAWAY\n\n\n284\n\n\n.317\n\n\n.399\n\n\n.623\n\n\n1.023\n\n\n18\n\n\n21\n\n\n177\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThese numbers make more sense than Votto's, as Angel Stadium of Anaheim has been the 2nd-worst hitters park in the majors this year. Also, Mike Trout is probably a robot/alien and his numbers aren't to be trusted.\nBut overall, the trend is clear: Good hitters like Bryce Harper, Josh Donaldson, Andrew McCutchen, Miguel Cabrera, Paul Goldschmidt, and Nolan Arenado ALL hit better at home than on the road.\nIt is 100 percent natural and normal for a player to have greater success in his own yard than he would elsewhere. He gets to sleep in his own bed and see his family. He's familiar with the batter's eye and the dimensions of the park. He gets to hear the same awful song of his choosing before stepping into the box. Maybe the crowd gives him a boost. Maybe he gets an extra call or two from the umpires. It all makes plenty of sense.\nSo again, the reason I wanted to point out these numbers is not to take anything away from any of these players. They are all having absolutely tremendous seasons. I'm a fan of all of 'em.\nBut it would probably be wise for people to pump the brakes on bashing the statistics of a player such as Arenado, simply because he hits better in Coors Field. Coors Field is his home park, and just about everybody hits better in their home park.\n\nNow we head to the weekly departments...\n\nAss of the week:\n\nFreaking Papelbon, man.\n\nI doubt there's much need for me to provide you with the set-up, but just in case... here's the video of the events in question (for those who have been living under a rock with your fingers in your ears and your eyes held tightly shut.)\n\n\n\nThe takes have been rolling in on this for a couple days now, so I'll go ahead and throw in my thoughts on the matter. (Update: I don't have the time to dive into this the way I had hoped, so...) I'll just say this: If you somehow think what Papelbon did was okay, you:\n\n \n\nAre wrong.\nSimply do not like Bryce Harper. That's what this boils down to. You don't care about how much hustle he showed on that play. (A player has done what Harper did there in every game I've ever seen.) You don't care about "the code". No, if you're defending Papelbon, it probably means you've wanted to do to Harper what that douchey old meat head did. You don't like Harper's hair, you don't like his eye black, you don't like the way he runs, you don't like the way he talks to the media, you don't like how violent his swing is, you don't like his magazine covers, you don't like his gold cleats in the All-Star Game, you don't like the hype, and you don't like that he's better than everyone else in baseball.

0435_57d35a91-7b19-4241-82aa-70f28341ae9b	(CNN) -  \nJohn Boehner appears secure in his speakership -- for now. \n \nSenior House Republicans are beginning to close ranks behind Boehner, blunting conservatives who are trying to oust the speaker because they're frustrated he isn't more confrontational with President Barack Obama. \n\nThe rapidly shifting developments are giving Boehner and his leadership team space to move forward this month with a complicated plan to fund the government through the fall without immediately restricting money to Planned Parenthood, something bound to prompt a sharp outcry from conservatives. \n\nHouse Republican leaders are expected to soon move forward with a short-term funding bill. Separately, they would aim to pass a measure to defund Planned Parenthood through a process known as "budget reconciliation" that would bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. \n\nThat would presumably avert the threat of a government shutdown at month's end, as the White House would veto a funding bill that axes money to Planned Parenthood, and Boehner allies have been moving to tamp down opposition to the effort. \n\nBoehner's hold on the speakership is strengthened because conservatives lack an alternative candidate -- or much of a strategy -- to replace the Ohio Republican. And a growing number of rank-and-file House GOP lawmakers are eager to move past the intraparty warfare that has undercut much of the party's agenda. \n\nRep. Blake Farenthold, a conservative Texas Republican who voted for Boehner in January but has demanded the leadership take a harder line on Planned Parenthood, told CNN he wouldn't currently support a resolution known as "vacating the chair." That rare procedural move would strip Boehner of the speaker's gavel if successful. \n\n"I'm not going to support a 'vacate the chair' until we got somebody I think can do a better job than Boehner," Farenthold said Thursday. "There's no point throwing Boehner out until there is somebody to replace him." \n\nPlanned Parenthood has become a top target of congressional Republicans after edited videos surfaced this summer from an anti-abortion group showing organization officials discussing the sale of aborted tissue. \n\nDespite the drama unfolding in the House, Boehner won the public backing Thursday of his No. 2 -- House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California -- who called on House Republicans to drop efforts to ouster him. \n\n"If we (delve) into this type of debate, we only weaken ourselves on what we want to achieve," McCarthy told reporters. \n\nAsked how confident he was that he could maintain his hold of the speakership, Boehner said: "Very." \n\nIdaho Rep. Mike Simpson, a close ally of Boehner's, told reporters Thursday that that the speaker could easily beat back a challenge, saying, "Anybody can bring that at any time, but it's survivable." \n\nHe suggested that party leaders should allow the vote to come to the House floor to "put it to rest." \n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group that includes some Republicans opposed to Boehner, are deliberating their plans to overthrow the speaker. They need more than 29 House Republicans to vote to vacate the chair if they want to throw Boehner's speakership into flux. In January, 25 House Republicans refused to back the speaker. If additional Republicans were to vote against him, Boehner could rely on Democratic votes to keep his leadership post, though that would undermine him politically. \n\nArizona Rep. Matt Salmon, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, said the debate over the funding bill and Planned Parenthood could be the "proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back" among those calling for a new speaker. \n\nBut Salmon added: "There's no concerted effort right now to replace Boehner," admitting that "it's just talk. That's all it is." \n\nOther leaders of the House Freedom Caucus said they would wait until after Pope Francis' visit to the Capitol next week to push forward on a vote. They are waiting to see how Boehner handles a number of thorny issues this fall -- including raising the debt limit, whether to revive the controversial Export-Import Bank and the government shutdown fight --- before pressing forward on their plans. \n\n"Look, the problem that we have here is not an ideological problem with Speaker Boehner," said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, a leader of the effort to oust Boehner. "The problem that we have here is that he's subverting our republic." \n\nMassie said the GOP does have a viable alternative -- Rep. Daniel Webster, a 66-year-old Florida conservative who challenged Boehner in January but won just 12 votes. \n\n"Daniel Webster is a very viable alternative," Massie said. \n\nWhen it comes to the funding fight, the math is already against Boehner. Thirty-one House Republicans, led by South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, are on record saying they won't vote for a spending bill that doesn't defund Planned Parenthood. That means Boehner will have to rely on Democrats to pass any government funding bill -- something he's had to do in previous showdowns. \n\nSimpson, the Idaho Republican, said it's time to write off this group of conservatives, since they were "never" going to vote for a short-term spending bill in any event. \n\n"We shouldn't be spending all our time trying to satisfy those 30 people," Simpson said. \n\nStill, setting aside the demands of this group could be perilous for Boehner, some conservatives warn.
0436_f7de29eb-a2d5-4ed4-8595-cdeb0c053847	Psychopathic traits have been found in young children - but just how young will surprise you. \n\nWhy violent psychopaths don't 'get' punishmentSmarter psychopaths commit less crime Psychopathic traits can be identified in children as young as three, according to Australian-led research that measured how youngsters reacted to different facial expressions and neutral or distressing images.\n\nThe international team led by the University of NSW developed the diagnostic tool in world-first research that shows very young children can display callous and unemotional traits linked to psychopathy.\n\nMore than 200 children aged between three and six took part in the study, which found that 10 per cent showed callous and unemotional traits such as lacking remorse or empathy for the feelings of other people.\n\nLead author of the study and senior lecturer at UNSW, Eva Kimonis​, said the diagnostic tool would allow children at risk of psychopathy to get earlier treatment.\n\n"Until now we didn't really have a way to identify those traits in very young children," she said. "This is really the first study which uses tools adapted for very young children and the sooner those children are identified, the earlier they can be helped."\n\nThe children were assessed using a combination of tests adapted for their age and interviews with their parents and teachers.\n\nThe tests measured their ability to recognise changing and static facial expressions as well as their reactions to distressing and neutral images, such as a crying child or a book.\n\n"Even very young children with these traits show that difficulty in recognising emotions in others and they are also not engaged by other people's emotions," Dr Kimonis said.\n\n"When they see people in distress it's not capturing their attention in the same way as it would for the healthy population."\n\nThe tools were specifically designed to capture callous traits, which would distinguish children at risk of psychopathy from children with developmental disorders such as autism.\n\nDr Kimonis said the study, which has been published in the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, would have important implications in the treatment of children at risk of criminal behaviour in later life.\n\nThe Parent-Child Research Clinic at UNSW runs free programs for eligible families, developing the children's emotional skills and supporting their parents rather than prescribing medication.\n\n"There's been a real shift toward trying to prescribe medication to these very young children, which is concerning because we don't know how safe that is," Dr Kimonis said.\n\n"We're targeting the problem from a different angle and focusing on adapting parent management training programs that are known to be effective for other antisocial children.\n\n"The key things are trying to develop the child's emotional skills. We coach the parents how to be very warm, involved and loving with them to see if that reduces those callous traits over time." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0437_0e6fa0a5-8cdf-471b-8139-b73ae66deb4d	President Obama sees the pathway to a clean energy future and confronts fossil fuel interests that are blocking progress and stifling free markets. With the Paris Climate COP only months away, the heat is on world leaders to back big talk with viable plans for future climate action. Earlier this week, President Obama, at the forefront of the global stage, kicked off a 100-day climate tour with an impassioned presentation at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas.\n\nAlways the effective orator, Obama set a hopeful vision for a clean energy future, focusing his message on both the imperative and the financial benefits of immediate and decisive climate action.\n\n“We’re here today because we believe that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future than climate change,” he said. “But we’re also here because we are deeply optimistic about American ingenuity. We think we can do good and do well at the same time. We believe we have the power, dynamism, and creativity to solve a big problem while keeping the engines of the American economy moving.”\n\nFor climate action advocates, Obama’s tenure has had its highs and lows. On one hand, during his presidency, America become one of the largest producers of dirty energy (oil and natural gas) in the world, and decisions like approving oil drilling in the Arctic have been unfathomable at best.\n\nOn the other hand, we’ve become a major player in clean energy, which undeniably has boosted our economy and created well-paying jobs. We’ve also become more aware of sustainability issues, enhanced our energy efficiency, and decreased emissions. This progress is due, in part, to federal mandates, including stringent fuel efficiency standards on vehicles and appliances, as well as the implementation of green building programs at federal, state, and local levels.\n\nObama’s Clean Power Plan promises to help us further clean up our act. Providing the first-ever framework to reduce pollution from power plants, the Clean Power Plan requires states to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. \n\nThrough the Recovery Act, the Obama administration has bet big on a clean energy future, investing in clean technologies with the hope that the private sector would follow suit. Fortunately, the bet paid off: our nation’s solar and wind industries are stronger than ever, with exponential year after year growth, thousands of clean energy projects across the country, and tens of thousands of high-paying jobs.\n\nToday, the U.S. is a global leader in wind power (we produce three times more wind power now than we did in 2008, with 500 wind power manufacturers across 43 states supporting 50,000 jobs and supplying enough energy to power 16 million homes.) Obama projects that wind power could provide as much as 35% of our nation’s total energy by 2

The company faces long list of challenges including management departures and a lack of user growth. \n \nOn top, it is criticized for lagging far behind rival Facebook in key metrics. But is it realistic to compare it with Facebook and set a very high expectation? \n \n“Twitter and Facebook are different products, and it doesn’t make sense to compare their growth and revenues” said Kartik Hosanagar, Professor of Technology and Digital Business at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \n \nThe article titled “Will Twitter Remain in Facebook’s Shadow?” raised this fundamental question about user growth. \n \nTwitter’s service is used by many high profile figures including politicians.  According to Hosanagar, Twitter’s service appeals to a more professional audience, whereas Facebook has a more widespread appeal. So the slowdown in user growth is not the fault of Twitter’s management entirely. \n Shares Tank  \nHowever, since the IPO in 2013 until the second quarter of 2015, Twitter has increased its user base by 19.2 percent to 304 million. During the same period, Facebook’s user base has soared 35.5 percent to 1.49 billion. \n \nAs a result, Facebook shares have risen 132 percent since its IPO in 2012. In contrast Twitter (TWTR :NYSE) is trading at $27, a little above the IPO price of $26. After rising to $53 earlier this year, shares have crashed. \n \n“Difficulty in using the service, as well as mediocre adoption by the mass market, are some reasons why Twitter’s user growth has not taken off” said Anthony Noto, Twitter’s CFO, during the company’s second quarter earnings conference call in July. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nDespite the negative news on user growth, Twitter reported 61 percent increase in revenue and a lower net loss compared to last year in the second quarter, even beating Wall Street’s expectations. \n \nHowever, lower user engagement on the site added more pressure on the company. For the second quarter, Twitter said the “ratio of daily active users to monthly active users” was about 44 percent, compared to 48 percent for the first three quarters of 2014. The user engagement has come down in the last few quarters. \n \nThe efforts to find a new CEO as well as attracting and retaining employees are other struggles the company faces. CEO Dick Costolo, stepped down on July 1. Several product executives have also left the company this year. \n \nTwitter’s headhunting firm has approached former Cisco executive Padmasree Warrior and CBS Interactive boss Jim Lanzone, according to a Bloomberg report. Ironically, such news and rumours are posted on twitter with the hashtag #goodlucktwitter. \n \n“I have practiced 35 different ways to say this, I am not going to make any comments with the CEO process,” said Noto on Wednesday at the 2015 Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. \n \nThe company paid $175 million stock based compensation in the second quarter to attract and retain employees, the main reason for the financial loss. \n New Products  \nThe company is rolling out new products and initiatives to improve marketing to potential users. “Twitter should be as easy to use as looking at the window,” according to the company. However it is not. So the company is focusing on simplifying the product to increase its user base. \n \nProject Lightning is one of the initiatives launched recently. It is expected to create simplicity and ease in use. The Company will launch media campaigns to build awareness on how to use twitter. It is the biggest fundamental shift in the product according to the CFO Noto. \n \nThe company will continue to look for new revenue streams as well. Twitter and Google have recently teamed up to provide media houses and publishers a better and quicker platform to display their stories on smartphones. The new solution will help readers see stories from “cached” websites instantly. \n \nTwitter has also struck a deal with Google to provice access to tweets within online search. \n \nDespite all the product and revenue initiatives, the company is still very careful in setting low expectations for user growth at least for the near term. \n \nProfessor Hosanagar says it is too early to be negative about Twitter. “I think Twitter has a good and viable business but will likely be in

My co-counsel and I will continue to pursue all legal and diplomatic strategies to secure our client's release, including through the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.'\n\nAfter visiting the Maldives, Amal and her co-counsel will travel to Sri Lanka and India for further meetings regarding the case.\n\nAmal, who was dressed in a smart black shirt and white trousers, looked in good spirits despite a difficult fight ahead.has been juggling a number of high-profile international cases this summer.\n\nJust over a week ago the lawyer was representing Al-Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy in an Egypt courtroom, who was charged, along with his colleagues Baher Mohamed and Australian Peter Greste, with operating without a press licence and broadcasting material harmful to Egypt.\n\nThe three men were each handed three-year jail terms at the hearing at Cairo’s Tora Prison.\n\nAfterwards Amal, whose presence in court received more attention than her client’s from photographers and TV crews, denounced the jail terms as ‘sending a dangerous message that there are judges in Egypt who will allow their courts to become instruments of political oppression and propaganda’.\n\nA week before that case, Amal was with her husband as she joined the Hollywood star at a bash to launch his new tequila in Ibiza, after flying in from their home in Lake Como, Italy, where the couple have spent much of their summer.\n\nBy Joanna Crawley
0440_f62ba1b3-8a8b-4f4a-8a58-1816417cefbf	Stephanie Moseley and Earl Hayes )Photo Source: Instagram and Twitter) \n \nThe tragedy of domestic violence against woman in the Black community is on a steady rise. More Black women are killed by their boyfriends than any other demographic in the America. In these cases, Black women are increasingly the victims of gun violence. \n \nThese stories have been often overlooked in the national media except when it affects celebrities. Take for example the best friend of boxer Floyd Mayweather. Mayweather was chatting by FaceTime to his best friend Earl Hayes. Hayes was having a violent confrontation with his wife Stephanie Moseley, well-known backup dancer and star on VH1’s “Hit the Floor.” Hayes accused Moseley of having an affair with Trey Songz. Mayweather was shocked to hear multiple gunshots ring out as Hayes gunned down Mosley, who was taking a bath. For the next few minutes, a horrified Mayweather pleaded with a despondent Hayes to calm down and not hurt himself. When LAPD arrived at the home, Hayes turned the gun on himself in a tragic murder-suicide. \n \nAccording to a study by the Violence Policy Center to be released in October 2015 as part of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, nine out of 10 black women murdered by men are killed by someone they know, most often with a gun.  The study states, “In 2013, 453 black females were murdered by males in single victim/single offender incidents, at a rate of 2.36 per 100,000. In comparison, the rate for white women murdered by males for that year was 0.95 per 100,000. Nationwide, across all races, 1,615 females were murdered by males in single victim/single offender incidents in 2013, at a rate of 1.09 per 100,000.” \n \nIt has been estimated that 59 percent of black female victims were shot and killed with guns, a sobering statistic. The study goes on to state: \n \n“-Compared to a black male, a black female is far more likely to be killed by her spouse, an intimate acquaintance, or a family member than by a stranger. Where the relationship could be determined, 92 percent of black females killed by males in single victim/single offender incidents knew their killers. Of the black victims who knew their offenders, 56 percent were wives, common-law wives, ex-wives, or girlfriends of the offenders. \n \n-The vast majority of homicides of black females murdered by males were not related to any other felony crime. Most often, black females were killed by males in the course of an argument. In cases where the circumstances could be identified, 84 percent were not related to the commission of any other felony.” \n \nThe study then goes on to list the top 10 states with the highest rates of females murdered by males in single victim/single offender incidents in 2013: \n South Carolina            2.32 per 100,000  Alaska                         2.29 per 100,000  New Mexico                 2.00 per 100,000  Louisiana                   1.99 per 100,000  Nevada                      1.95 per 100,000  (tie)   Tennessee       1.65 per 100,000  (tie)   Oklahoma         1.65 per 100,000  Vermont                    1.58 per 100,000  Maine                         1.47 per 100,000  Michigan                  1.45 per 1

Abraham became the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse, Jesse the father of David the king. David became the father of Solomon, whose mother had been the wife of Uriah. Solomon became the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asaph. Asaph became the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah. Uzziah became the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah. Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amos, Amos the father of Josiah. Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile. After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, Azor the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud, Eliud the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary. Of her was born Jesus who is called the Christ. Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the Holy Spirit. Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly. Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the Holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel, which means "God is with us." I\nntroductory Prayer: Lord I thank you for the gift of faith. I believe only because so many others believed before me – and often at what great price! As I begin this prayer I review my genealogy of faith remembering all those who have passed on the faith to me. I strive to be a link in the faith chain for many other souls. Petition: Dear Jesus, help me to be humble like the Blessed Virgin Mary.   God Is With Us: Today’s Gospel narrates for us the great mystery of the Incarnation. Why would God choose to become one of us? In his lineage appear the good and the bad, the faithful and the weak, the useful and useless. Why does God choose to take what is faulty, inferior, and make it his own? Why does he purify, restore, elevate, and cure what we are and what we offer him? Why? Why does he take upon himself my lineage, my personal history –– both the good and the bad –– and shape it into salvation history, for myself and for others? Why does he continue to do this? When will it be enough? God has said and will always be able to say, “What more could I have done for my people?” Blessed Are You, and Blessed Is the Fruit of Your Womb: Joachim and Anna, the parents of Mary, were in a marriage apparently “going nowhere”: It was sterile. Tradition has it that Joachim was scorned by a bystander when presenting his offerings, because God had left him without offspring. Feeling deeply offended and downhearted, he followed his flocks of sheep into the wilderness and didn’t return to his wife for a long time. In the desert, he supposedly was informed by a supernatural appearance that a child would be born to him. When Joachim returned to his wife in Bethesda, inspired with new hope, she became pregnant and gave birth to Mary, who was born without sin. God takes what is useless and creates his masterpiece, the Immaculate Conception. Indeed, he raises up the lowly. What plans does he have for my life? Where do I fit into salvation history? Let It Be Done According to Your Word: Having been told by her parents of the special circumstances of her birth, Mary grew of age “treasuring these things in her heart” (Cf. Luke 2:51). It is understandable that the pious girl Mary wanted to devote herself entirely to God, and perhaps, in her early years, took a vow of continence. Her simple and total dedication to God indeed made her his “highly favored daughter.” But God had other plans for her: He would ask her to bear his Son. Once again, God takes what is freely offered him and molds it into what he desires. He takes what is good and beautiful and makes it exceedingly so for the salvation of many. God humbly inserts himself into my boring and defective human lineage.  Conversation with Christ: Lord, help me to remember today all the good things you have given me and my family. Let me see your work and your providence. I know that you come to my aid in hundreds of different ways. Help me to become more like Mary, and to ponder over all these things in my heart.  Resolution: I will look at my vocation with faith and new hope, confident that God is comfortable in inserting himself in the most common of circumstances. I will try to see his hand in at least one event of my day today.

0442_a48c010c-4330-4fc2-be0d-25e59f2b80a0	A Texas capital murder trial is set to proceed Monday — but the defendant has already experienced a very small taste of how an electric chair might feel: He was given a shock in court for refusing to comply with a judge's orders. \n \nJames Calvert, 45, has represented himself in the possible death penalty case since 2012, when he was charged with killing his estranged wife and abducting their son. \n \nCalvert was outfitted with a shock belt after Judge Jack Skeen raised security concerns and said Calvert was acting erratically, Reuters reported . The belt was used when Calvert didn't follow a judge's order to stand up. \n \nKathryn Kase, executive director of Texas Defender Service, told NBC News that Calvert appears to be mentally ill and shouldn't have been allowed to act as his own lawyer in the first place. \n \n"The Supreme Court has ruled: People with a history of mental illness are supposed to show a much higher level of competence to represent themselves," she said. \n \nIt does not appear that Calvert has shown that level of competence, Kase said, adding that earlier in the trial, Calvert told the judge that all of his objections "will be phrased as 'foxtrot.'" \n \n"That's something that someone with mental illness does," she said. "That says to me, someone is losing their grip on reality." \n     \n James Calvert  Smith County Sheriff \n \nA sheriff's lieutenant told Reuters that the shock belt is used like a Taser, and it is less obvious to a jury than leg irons and handcuffs. It was unclear who ordered it to be used, Kase said. \n \nSkeen did not respond to interview requests on Sunday, and Reuters reported that he issued a gag order on the trial. \n \nAfter the shock was administered, Skeen told Calvert that would no longer be allowed to represent himself, Kase said. \n \nBut a two-week break, she added, was hardly enough time for a new attorney to prepare his case. \n \n"During all this time that Mr. Calvert was representing himself, he wasn't doing what a qualified lawyer [would be] doing," she said.
0443_24c356fd-67c1-4038-95a9-ae7bb417b115	FOX's Sleepy Hollow returns for a new season this week, and the season premiere features a face that will be familiar to TV fans. Actress Charlene Amoia endeared herself to audiences as the waitress Wendy on CBS's How I Met Your Mother , but now she's taking a completely different turn. \n \nStarpulse spoke to Charlene to discuss diving into  Sleepy Hollow and what it was like for her to be the titular character in the first new episode, "I Witness." It goes without saying that she's not just visiting town. \n \n"Season two has Ichabod [Tom Mison] and Abbie [Nicole Beharie] dealing with very different sets of dangers than we’ve seen in the last two seasons," Charlene explained. "My character Susan James witnesses some dark things at work and is weighed down by the secrets she's keeping. With the help of Abbie and Ichabod she learns how to tackle the perils head on." \n\nAs for joining the Sleepy Hollow cast, "It was the first episode back from hiatus so everyone was in good spirits and happy to be there," she told us. "I really enjoyed talking with and getting to know Tom Mison and Nicole Beharie. They were both very sweet and lovely to work with." \n \nCharlene also explained how she approaches a role like Susan, knowing that unlike the recurring part she had as Wendy, she's only going to have one episode to find and explore this character. \n \n"The writers are usually pretty good with wrapping up a character's story line within the episode, so I usually just focus on connecting into the circumstances and bringing in some added nuances to the role," she said. \n \n[embedded content] \n \n"I try not to get attached to wanting to be on any particular show and try to make decisions more on if the role speaks to me in some way. One of the things I ask when looking at material is, “Why is this material coming to me now?” and go from there." \n \nNot that she wouldn't have welcomed more episodes with one of her past characters. "I would have liked to do a few more episodes of Switched At Birth ," said Charlene, who played Diana Coto on the ABC Family series. \n \n"In my episodes my husband was cheating on me with an intern. It would have been cool to have been able to confront him and explore the strength of my character in that situation." \n \nAfter Sleepy Hollow , you can find her more on the big screen. "I have a couple thrillers coming out soon," she teased. " Nefas: The Demon Within and Live-Evil are being released this year. \n \n"I also shot a feature called FAT alongside my friend Mel Rodriguez that premiered at TIFF and will now be released in select theaters. FAT is a film that addresses food addiction and mental illness in a way that I’ve never seen before." \n \nNot unlike Susan James is about to see some things she's never seen before. To find out what and if she makes it through, tune in when Charlene's episode of Sleepy Hollow , "I Witness," airs Thursday at 9 PM ET/PT on FOX.
0444_c5cca59e-de49-487a-8324-4474beafd522	Just before the sun came up on Tuesday, Blue Gum Farm at Euroa – like all stud farms across the country – was bracing itself for newborn foals and pregnant mares. Just before the sun came up on Tuesday, Blue Gum Farm at Euroa – like all stud farms across the country – was bracing itself for newborn foals and pregnant mares, with staff members hoping the next three months go smoothly.\n\nIt was September 1, the start of the spring breeding season. The long hours of working out the perfect cross for this mare and that stallion are over. Theory and stud books are put away and sleeves rolled up for months of pregnancy tests and mares bringing new life into the world.\n\nThere are many tell-tale signs farms are looking for in the early months of spring. Heavily in-foal mares begin to drip milk, while dry mares – without foals – begin to come into season.\n\nThe principal of Blue Gum, Phillip Campbell, said from September 1 his stud farm went into full swing.\n\n"There's a lot happening. We've got mares ready for serving or mating, and then you wait and hope for a positive result. It's a long process, and at the same time we have our staff come in when it's dark to monitor all the mares that are pregnant and waiting to give birth," he said.\n\n"They're a specialised team, but you can't stretch your employees around the clock, as 90 per cent of the mares will only give foal in the dark. It's probably nature's way, because they're at their most relaxed at night and there's less chance of predators interfering in their labour.\n\n"It's a ... large operation: first-time mares having foals, former race mares being covered by stallions for the first time, it's very much a hectic time of year."\n\nBlue Gum is no different from breeding establishments across Australasia, with owners of first-time brood mares waiting anxiously for positive pregnancy tests and others eagerly awaiting the birth of foals.\n\nIt is an expensive operation, with owners hoping their filly foal or weanling colt will find group 1 success and make them very wealthy.\n\nThe science behind successful pregnancies and trouble-free births is complex.\n\nVeterinary surgeons remain on hand over these three months.\n\nCampbell said: "There are some extremely expensive mares being covered by extremely valuable stallions.\n\n"There's a lot of time, patience, money and science that goes into it. It's not like the human example of throwing the keys to the car to a young couple and going to the drive-in." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0445_40225c28-594a-4c53-8cb9-356a85a32496	Today's post is nothing for wallflowers at all! The eclectic fashion of L.O.M. is bright, bold and made to turn heads. Modern Frida Kahlo's can't miss this under no circumstances, L.O.M will conquer your life in a powerful wave of rainbow colours.\nBrighton-based British avant-garde fashion designer Louise O'Mahony is the brain behind the label. She graduated as textile student of the year in 2005 on her degree of Costume Design & Textiles from the University of Huddersfield.\nSince then her work has been exhibited in many fashion shows in the UK and been featured in magazines such as Nylon, Grazia or Elegant. Louise also runs 1950's inspired label Oh My Honey and works on commissions for singers, performers and brides.\nHer current collection for L.O.M. is called "Folklorico" and was inspired by Mexican, Asian and European folklore. Pom poms, fringed seams and elaborate flower prints turn the designs into a vibrant adventure for girls brave enough to embrace their feminity.\nInterview with Louise O'Mahony, founder of L.O.M. Louise, your current collection is inspired by folklore from all over the world. How did you come up with this inspiration?\nI really love to travel, and once every couple of years I try to take myself on a big trip. A few years ago I spent six months in Asia and was completely bombarded with inspiration from every angle. I visited a lot of hill tribes in Northern Laos, Cambodia and Thailand and loved their clothes and the craftsmanship of their textiles. I took a lot of pictures and bought a lot of fabrics and materials that I have been holding onto, waiting for the right time to use. I also went to Mexico recently and I could see how the two very different continents had similarities in their indigenous people.\nWho is the woman that wears your clothes?\nI originally thought my clothes would be worn by performers and very avant-garde people. However, this collection has been so popular with all kinds of women all over the world. Festival season has been very busy, particularly for the fringed Lycra top and pom pom frill jumpsuit, because they are so much fun to run around a field in! But women have also been buying my clothes to wear to weddings, on holidays, even to work. I think the kind of woman that wears my clothes is just someone that loves colours, like to stand out in a crowd, and isn't afraid to wear something different!\nCould you please describe the process of creating one of your collections from the birth of the idea to moment when it's finished?\nEvery year I create a new collection inspired by one theme, once the theme is decided I start gathering inspiration, materials, images, and create a mood board to work from. I sketch between 50-100 different designs, then take the things I like most and mix them together with the other designs to make a whole collection. For the Lycra pieces, I designed the print and then have it printed in the UK, we then cut out the shapes, add the detail – the customer can choose from a huge range of different colour pom poms, fringes and tassels - then we start to construct the garment. All of my pieces are constructed by myself and my skilled seamstresses in my studios in Brighton, UK.\nYour fashion is a firework of colour, and every piece is extraordinary. How does your personal wardrobe look, do you sometimes wear boring basics?\nNot really. I don't own much black. I'll be honest, when I'm working 16 hour days in the studio, my 50's skirt with giant petticoat and sequinned crop top aren't the most practical or comfortable to wear, but even if I am just in leggings and a jumper you can bet they are bright, bold, with all kinds of prints and colours going on. (In Winter I wear a dinosaur onesie I made for my boyfriend over my clothes – haha!)\nDo you prefer to work on collaborations for singers and brides or to design your collections?\nThat is a really difficult question! I love making the one-off performance or bridal pieces, because they are usually very unique projects to get the chance to create, and you get great pictures. However, designing and making my own collections is so much fun, and it is such a great feeling to know that people all over the world are partying in things I have made.\nLet's have a little look into the future: What can we expect from you, another label, completely different inspiration themes?\nI think two labels is enough for now! They are both very different, and both do different things for me. One focuses on 1950's bridal wear, delicate, big skirts, petticoats, lace and beadwork, and the other on outrageous colourful festival and party wear, Lycra, tassels, sequins. They are ticking all the boxes for me right now. But new things are coming for both of them. I will be launching a new collection for L.O.M. at Brighton fashion week in October, and a new bridal wear collection for Oh My Honey in January!\nThank you very much for the interview, Louise, I'll keep both of my eyes on your work!\nVisit L.O.M here don't forget to like them on Facebook.\nCopyright of all pictures by Louise O'Mahony.
0446_04777f0c-34d0-4e2d-8096-789426cfb6c9	Long-term Contrarian / Value Investing: Turning an Oxymoron Into an Opportunity – Tocqueville Asset Management\nAugust 27, 2015 | About: BRK.A +0% BRK.B +0%\nPrint Email CanadianValue\nArticles (4392) \n218 followers Follow\nIn my observation, there is more than one discipline that can lead to investment success, and some of the proven ones are quite different from each other. The secret to investing successfully, therefore, is to adopt and follow a discipline that is in harmony with your personality. For my part, I feel in total harmony with the contrarian and value disciplines that have guided my investments for 40 years. At the same time, I also claim (and aim) to be a long-term investor. Yet, almost from the start of my career, I have had the somewhat uncomfortable feeling that, in practice, these claims may be contradictory. The value discipline implies more trading than one would wish The basic tenet of value investing is that you should buy a stock well below a conservative calculation of its intrinsic value. This, however, implies a corollary: When a stock gets well above that purchase price, and thus no longer represents value, it should be sold. With the well-known bipolar characteristics of the stock market, this means that value investing is bound to cause more trading than a conservative, long-term investor would, in theory, prefer. Ben Graham, godfather of value investing, advised buying stocks of companies at a conservatively adjusted value of liquid or nearly liquid assets, reduced by all liabilities. On the sell side, his advice was fairly simple: Sell once you're up 50 percent, or sell in two years, whichever happens first. This tells us that Graham, whom many still revere as the epitome of a long-term investor, did not in fact have a time horizon much in excess of two years. Warren Buffett, Graham’s self-proclaimed disciple, in practice has adopted a somewhat different approach during his career, as illustrated by statements in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) chairman’s letters: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” (1989) weakens Graham’s narrow criteria for purchase; and “When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever” (1988) seems to do away with the sell side of the value discipline. This evolution reflects the fact that, after being schooled by Graham, Buffett became importantly influenced by Phil Fisher, who could have been labeled the godfather of growth investing. In particular, while the early Buffett claimed to find all the information he needed in companies’ annual reports, Fisher advocated research based on deep and frequent contacts at all levels of a company – he was looking for excellence in the management of businesses he selected. In 1987 investment adviser John Train described Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) as 85% influenced by Benjamin Graham and 15% by Philip Fisher ("The Midas Touch," Harriman House, 2009). Today it is quite possible that these proportions have been reversed, which allows Buffett to keep a significant portion of his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio with little or no trading. However, it seems that the performance of that portfolio has become more average in recent years. This may be due to the fact investments in small and medium-sized companies, which are followed by fewer analysts and where value is thus somewhat easier to uncover, are less meaningful in a portfolio of the size now held by Berkshire Hathaway. Contrarian investing and the acceleration of everything Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio), founder of The Baupost Group, summarizes: “Value investing is at its core the marriage of a contrarian streak and a calculator” (Outstanding Investor Digest, March 17, 2009). This gives me a convenient transition to a review of contrarian investing: I saw an earlier version of the cartoon on the left several years ago, and it stuck in my mind as a perfect illustration of the insanity of blindly extrapolating the recent past, as many stock market investors tend to do. The more recent cartoon on the right, quoting comedian Steven Wright, is a wonderful warning of the dangers of complacency. Put another way, to a contrarian, the tendency just to follow recent market momentum because the consensus complacently dictates doing so is no better than assuming there is no danger in walking toward a cliff just because you haven’t fallen off yet. In 1949 Life magazine hailed Humphrey B. Neill as the father of contrary opinion. In "The Art of Contrary Thinking" (Caxton Press, 1954), Neill wrote, “No problem connected with the Theory of Contrary Opinion is more difficult to solve than … how to know what prevailing general opinions are and how to measure their prevalence and intensity.” Today’s constant flow of news reports that are both instantaneous and repetitive, as well as the multiplication of commentaries and opinions on both old and new media, makes it even harder than in 1954 to evaluate the importance and significance of a consensus. Our natural tendency to think that we belong to the original-thinking minority leads us to exaggerate the size and strength of views contrary to our own. One fact remains true, however: The more media coverage predictions we receive, the more inaccurate they are likely to be. Neill said it some 60 years ago: I think I am on safe ground in asserting that so long as predictions remain popular and are so numerous as they are today – and so long as they receive notoriety through repetition in the press and on the radio – contrary opinions will increase in importance as thinking aids. Several knowledgeable and successful investors helped refine the notion further. For example, Barry Ritholtz reminds us that the contrarian should be looking at what will frustrate the largest number of people; Michael Steinhardt warns that contrarian investing isn't just about going against the grain – it's about exploiting expectations; and Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) tells us to look for cases where uniform belief has led to a mispricing of expectations and thus a way to make money. The problem in recent years has been the exponential growth and acceleration in the dissemination of news, opinions and forecasts. It helps to remember that when you see an expert opinion quoted in the newspapers or expressed on television, it reflects less a recent conclusion reached by an expert than the journalist’s choice to quote or invite that expert. Not only do journalists constitute a crowd; because of their race for novelty and sensationalism, theirs is a particularly volatile crowd. In a way, the Internet – where the available information is often selected, not by a person, but by an algorithm based on the popularity of posts – is an even better measure of the crowd; but unfortunately it is just as volatile in its offerings. As a result, except for rare consensus extremes, the contrarian approach is even less useful than in the past to time investments precisely. Saved by the clock! In a March 25 article, The Motley Fool offered the following quote from Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio): "Time is the individual investor's last remaining edge on professionals. If you can think about the next five years while most are focused on the next five months, you have an advantage over everyone who tries to outperform based on sheer intellect." In doing my research for this paper, I came across an article by Andrew Szabo, managing director of Greenwich Financial Management Inc. (Jan. 31, 2005). I do not know Szabo, but I believe his conclusion makes a lot of sense: The horizon over which you intend to invest is very important. There is a tremendous amount of money around that is seeking short-term returns. First, there are the “day traders,” which includes almost every market maker on Wall Street and many amateur investors. Next, there are the hedge funds, which tend to be very influenced by monthly reporting. Mutual fund managers tend to think in terms of quarters and full years, which is how pension fund consultants rate them. I believe the most attractive underused horizon is three to five years. Opinions and consensuses about the financial markets and the economies will continue to fluctuate along cycles that will often be too short to make a systematic contrarian approach compatible with a long-term investment strategy. But opportunities remain for a contrarian/value approach if one carefully selects one’s time horizon. We receive an enormous number of research reports on individual companies from brokers and other organizations. What is striking is how few analysts look beyond one or two years into the future. These are intelligent and educated individuals, so the chances of the consensus of analysts being drastically wrong in its anticipation of sales and earnings over such short horizons are relatively slim. This is especially so as, contrary to historical practices, company managements now “whisper” guidance about forthcoming results to the investment community. (Incidentally, and ironically, whenever a company’s actual results fail to reach the whispered numbers, analysts now report that it has “missed” the estimates. Of course, if the analysts had done their jobs, their estimates might have been different from the company’s whispers – and in fact, in such cases, it is the analysts’ estimates that “missed” the actual results.) My experience of recent years is that, if we are defining opportunities in terms of stocks about which expectations have fallen well below what common sense and our calculator tell us the underlying companies are worth, the three-to-five-year horizon should prove a fertile ground. Most analysts do not venture that far ahead, most institutional investors with supervisory guidelines and an eye on short-term relative performance are not interested, and the media’s time horizon keeps getting shorter rather than longer. At this writing, a majority of investors is still in shock from the tremors of the last few days, when major stock markets suffered their first significant corrections in six years. After such a long period of levitation and complacency, it could be argued that many stocks resembled flies in search of a windshield. As usual, once the flies found the windshield, experts and others frantically got busy pointing the finger to possible culprits: Greece, China, oil, governments and central banks, etc. Yet, I am convinced that there was no need for a particular trigger: Experience could have told us that such a correction was inevitable and that only the timing was uncertain. It is entirely possible that the current correction might continue and even worsen for a while, so there is no reason to indulge in a routine that became fashionable in recent years: “buying the dips.” On the other hand, we should not lose sight of the fact that stock-market performances have not been uniform in 2009-2015. With the general market indices down only modestly from their highs (though with a fanfare in the last few days), there is a broad sample of stocks that are already 30 to 50 percent below their five-year highs – a performance more in line with historical bear markets. A stock price doesn’t tell you anything about a company’s worth, but it tells you a lot about the popularity of the company with the crowd of investors. Simple contrarian opinion tells us that these stocks are not in favor and that, on a three-to-five-year horizon, this is where we should be looking for opportunities – with our calculator in hand.

0447_1c8bf64c-148b-4b58-a5c5-5608c80bad24	Ricky Church reports on the Heat 20th anniversary screening and Michael Mann Q&A at Toronto International Film Festival… \n \nOne of the most groundbreaking crime dramas of its time, Heat celebrated its 20 th anniversary at the Toronto International Film Festival with a screening of the film in a new 35mm print followed by a Q&A session with the director himself, Michael Mann. \n \n\n \nThis film was the first time ever legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starred together on the big screen. They had previously starred in The Godfather Part II together, but did not appear alongside each other due to De Niro’s role as Vito Corleone in flashbacks. Heat changes that by casting De Niro as a cool as ice thief and Pacino the obsessed cop determined to take him down. During the course of the film, these two characters discover they are not so different from each other, culminating in an epic shootout on the streets of downtown Los Angeles that forces De Niro’s thief to choose between his code of self-preservation and a new life. \n \nBefore the film began, Michael Mann came out and introduced it with a few questions by the moderator. He talked about how this idea came to life from the true events of his friend, former police detective Chuck Adamson. Neil McCauley was based on a real life thief of the same name Adamson hunted down, yet talked to Mann about the mutual respect the two had for each other. He said “There was this wonderful duality about how Charlie thought it. And this guy was such a high-class professional thief, he was a great pro with a lot of discipline. His regard for the guy didn’t make Charlie hesitate for two seconds to hunt him down and eventually got into a shootout after a foiled robbery.” \n \n“It wasn’t a contradiction of two different ways of being and thinking at all. Both were true and 100%. One didn’t diminish the other and that became the idea of the film”. Indeed, both Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna, De Niro’s and Pacino’s respective characters, are protagonists of their own story and get an equal amount of time in the film. Mann continued later on that what really attracted him to Adamson’s story was “the notion that life is way more complex in reality than it is in my power to make up.” \n \n\n \nMann also talked about the funny similarities between how a detective and director thinks. “They actually do the exact thing a director does. A director knows his characters, understands his characters motivations, expresses those in what the character may do in a certain scene. The detective shows up after a crime has occurred, sifts through what’s been left for them, tries to reconstruct the event, tries to then figure out the motive and locate the character. For the people who are really good at this, it becomes an addiction.” \n \nThis is shown very well in the film as Pacino’s Hanna is completely taken over with his work. His marriage is facing its end because of Hanna’s refusal to open up about the dark side of his job with his wife, continuously letting it push him further away from a ‘normal’ life. Even Jon Voight’s character warns McCauley of this, noting that Hanna is on his third marriage and that only displays Hanna’s commitment to the job. Mann even admitted one of his favourite lines in Heat is when Hanna admits to his wife “All I am is who I’m going after”. \n \nAfter the film, Mann came back out for an extended Q&A session, opening questions up to the audience. It was clear that even 20 years after this film was released it is still a beloved film and considered a favourite among Mann’s fans. The first question was about the notion of time in this film, specifically the line “Time is luck”. Mann said “Time is luck is what I believe. Personally, I find Neil to be a very tragic, heartbreaking character and I feel his expectations on what he wants to have in his life are tragically cut short. Time is luck and that’s why I keep repeating it in all these movies.” \n \nHe also explained where he got further inspiration for Heat and much of the imagery he used throughout the film and even some of his later films. Many fans of Heat probably know this story already, but Mann was very taken with a painting by Canadian painter Alex Colville depicting a man standing alone at a window, staring out into the ocean, with a gun sitting on the table behind him. This shot was used in an almost exact recreation as viewers see Neil McCauley coming home to an empty house, showing Neil’s life is bare of material things and human connection. “That was a profound sense of maintained, sustained alienation and loneliness. That’s how it affected me in the painting so I took great pains to recreate it.” \n \n\n \nHe also recalled a funny anecdote of when they first found the Malibu house that would become McCauley’s home, the window was covered in seagull poop (Mann used a less polite way of saying it), but he wanted it kept as it added to McCauley’s isolation. The next day, someone had cleaned it off not knowing Mann wanted it kept. \n \nAn interesting bit of history regarding this film was how, prior to 1995, it had been turned into a TV movie called L.A. Takedown . Mann had originally intended Adamson’s story to be a television series, following these characters over the course of a series. Mann revealed that he had written then script of Heat before L.A. Takedown , but used only about 40% of the script for the film. “I was interested in expanding all these characters and expanding their lives and imagined what it would be like over 22 hours.” After filming a pilot, NBC and Mann disagreed over certain aspects, so it premiered as a TV movie instead. Still keen to develop this project into a feature film Mann wisely kept ownership of the project and idea. He also admitted that it was “for the better” that this series did not make it to air. \n \nAn intriguing discovery during this panel was what some fans consider their favourite scene in Heat to be. While many critics point to the coffee scene between Pacino and De Niro as not only the best scene in the film, but one of the best scene in any film period, many fans agreed the final scenes between the two actors at the airport was their favourite. It is hard to deny that scene is one of the best in Heat as Hanna and McCauley give a final acknowledgement of their mutual respect with Moby’s “God Moving Over the Face of the Waters” playing over it. \n \nMann talked about the filming of this climax and how they were on location on the LAX runways to film the tense on foot chase. “It was fascinating because the plane were 250 feet over our heads. When they came through the ground shook and all the work we were all doing, myself, the actors, the crew, we were vibrating with the intensity of it. There’s something to be said for doing it for real. It’s not something you can do now, post-9/11.” \n \n\n \nExplaining further, Mann stated that he was trying to find “something that came from the ordinary, material world that we’re all familiar with, but yet is so depopulated of life that it feels like a transient stage or feeling. It had to be feel very industrial or real. Airports at night make me feel that way, particularly those zones where people never go. There’s nothing about those buildings or architecture that are made for people.” \n \nOne of the final questions to be asked was about the shots and use of scenery. Heat is beautifully shot from start to finish with a lot of great scenery overlooking LA. For those who don’t know, Heat was filmed entirely on location with no sound stages at all, a process that is very costly and rarely done in today’s cinema. For instance, the epic firefight on the streets of LA was a somewhat difficult process as they could only film on weekends between certain hours. Heat also has, what may be considered today, a rather unconventional style of shooting where a scene ends on an object or out of focus. \n \n“At the time, I was very interested in negative space and asymmetrical compositions and things that would subjectify the experience of the film. That was the one imperative that I wanted to do to. I wanted, to the extent that I could, bring audiences subjectively into moments and scenes and characters. For me, it comes with knowing exactly what you want to do, not necessarily how you’re going to do it, but knowing exactly what you want to do in as much detail as I could get.” \n \nMann concluded by saying “I think a lot of definition of moments in character comes from the anomalies so I started to look for what’s anomalous in a character’s behavior because that’s going to give him a lot of specificity of identity. I think audiences are way smarter than we know we are, perceptually we’re brilliant. I’ve always felt it’s my responsibility, my job, to use all these tools and constantly try to intensify the experience.” Asked to give an example of one these anomalies, Mann jokingly referred to Jon Voight’s hair and clothing in the film. \n \n\n \nHeat is, without a doubt, one of the best films in cinema and arguably Mann’s best. His friendly and thoughtful persona is evident as is his appreciation for fans of this film. What’s more is the amount of knowledge he has on filmmaking, character studies and letting his actors create spellbinding performances. Even if you’ve seen Heat a dozen times, pop it in your Blu-ray player right now and if you haven’t, you have no idea what you’ve been missing from Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and, most especially, Michael Mann. \n \nRicky Church

It was cut off with a pair of shears by Gordon’s colleague James Youd and Bridgette has kept it for posterity. \n \nVisitors to Arley Hall have been leaving donations at the gift shop and Gordon’s colleagues have also generously helped him raise more than £700 so far. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n“I’m really touched by everyone’s support,” said Gordon, who has been head gardener at Arley for seven years. \n \nTo make a donation to Gordon’s fundraising efforts email him at gordon.baillie@arleyhallandgardens.com

I couldn’t believe these people actually decided to go on the show and there were things I couldn’t even have imagined.” \n Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain (Ian West/PA) \nShe joined Matt Damon on The Graham Norton Show to talk about their latest movie, Ridley Scott’s The Martian. \n \nBased on the book by Andy Weir, Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney, who is presumed dead after his crew are forced to leave him on Mars. \n [embedded content] \nDespite being a huge star, Jessica said a lot of her movies took forever to be released. \n \n“For a long time I was making movies that then weren’t coming out for some odd reason, which is why in 2011 I had seven movies come out at once. They just kept getting delayed,” she told Graham Norton. \n \nShe added: “My mom would show off to her friends that her daughter was working with Al Pacino or playing Brad Pitt’s wife in a movie and then years would go by.

0452_207e50c0-dbdd-42d6-8c7a-20953047e90f	Story highlights Russian military moves inside Syria continued to escalate Friday with the arrival of fighter jets Russia's defense minister said the recent Russian military buildup in Syria is "defensive in nature" \nIn a "constructive conversation," both Carter and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu agreed to "further discuss mechanisms for deconfliction in Syria," Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in a statement, as the United States and its allies continue military operations against ISIS inside Syria. \n\nShoygu told Carter that the recent Russian military buildup in Syria is "defensive in nature" and aimed at supporting Russian obligations to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a senior U.S. Defense official told reporters. \n\nThe U.S. policy is that Assad, a close ally of Moscow, must leave office in order to resolve the years-long civil war, and U.S. officials have warily watched Russia's military support of the Syrian regime. \n\nHowever, with U.S. aircraft also operating in the country as America roots out ISIS, it is important that the two powers coordinate their military presence to avoid accidental encounters. \n\nAn intelligence official called the Russian buildup in Syria "significant" and said it would represent "the first major expeditionary force deployment" outside the former Soviet space that Moscow has undertaken since the war in Afghanistan. \n\nReports indicate the military buildup in Syria could consist of combat aircraft that are capable of striking ground targets, providing close air support and intercepting aircraft, and small numbers of main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers to transport troops to the battlefield. \n\nMoscow's ultimate intentions are unclear, but initial signs suggest a focus on providing air support to Syrian forces and to humanitarian relief operations. The U.S. also expects Russia to send a small presence of ground forces to support these operations. \n\nThe intelligence official added that "a challenge for Russia is maintaining a presence on the ground may require a robust force that could come in direct combat with various forces in the region." \n\nThe conversation between Carter and Shoygu seemed to differ somewhat from an earlier call this week between senior U.S. and Russian officials. \n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said he had spoken with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and was told Russian movements in Syria were being focused toward the battle against ISIS. \n\n"I'm not taking that at face value, because we look at the type of airplanes or the type of munitions and so forth, and it obviously raises much more serious questions about what is happening," Kerry told reporters Wednesday. \n\nTraveling in London on Friday, Kerry said the destruction of ISIS remains the top U.S. priority in Syria, but that the Obama administration was also committed to finding "a political settlement with respect to Syria, which we believe cannot be achieved in the long term presence of Assad." \n\nThe calls are the first between the two defense officials since the U.S. suspended military conversations with Moscow in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement inside Ukraine. \n\nREAD: Putin becomes a political punching bag in White House race \n\nDespite the calls between Kerry, Carter and their counterparts, State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner maintained on Friday that the communication did not signal a new phase in the relationship, and that high-level contact between the U.S. and Russian military on other matters "still remains on hold." \n\nOfficials said the call was initiated at the request of the Russian government, and it raises questions of how imminent any Russian military action in Syria may be. \n\nA U.S. official told CNN Friday that four Russian Sukhoi "Flanker" jets have arrived in Syria. It is unclear how those aircraft will eventually be used in Syria. \n\nPrior to that development, the U.S. had observed eight Russian military helicopters at the airbase in Syria that Russia is beefing up, and seen Russia move tanks, mobile artillery and armored vehicles into the Middle Eastern nation. \n\nThe defense official did not rule out future discussions between U.S. and Russian officials on Russian support missions for Assad, even though the U.S. opposes that support. \n\nWhile it is unclear what the next steps in the U.S.-Russian military relationship may be, the official said further talks would be aimed at trying to "avoid any misunderstanding" in that relationship. \n\n"This is the beginning of a conversation," the official said.
0453_f85357f1-7095-44ec-a91f-e775e5a288e5	THE country’s sole glass manufacturing firm, Zimglass, is facing liquidation after a potential Mauritian investor pulled out of the deal due to the company’s indebtedness, opting instead to buy its assets. \n\nBY OUR CORRESPONDENT\n\nThe investor wanted to inject $10 million into the business.\n\nHowever, the judicial manager, Winsley Militala of Petwin Executor and Trust, told creditors during a meeting at the High Court on Wednesday that the deal had fallen through and that the only option was to liquidate the company.\n\nAs at June 2014, Zimglass’ assets stood at $20,6 million against liabilities of $30,2 million.\n\n"The extent of indebtedness is so large and as such scares potential investors, as well as raising doubts as to future viability. \n\n"It is, therefore, my considered opinion that the company be liquidated and efforts made for the sale of the assets to the best advantage of stakeholders," he said. \n\nMilitala, who has been the firm’s judicial manager for over a year, said all efforts to revive it had not borne fruit after meeting a number of potential investors showing some "seriousness" and others "time wasters".\n\n"Faced with such a scenario, Zimglass is insolvent and has not traded even for a couple of hours. People came, did due diligence and walked away," he said. \n\nHe said investors such as Sahara Holdings Limited were prepared to buy the assets but not liabilities. \n\nSahara expressed interest in acquiring the assets and business of Zimglass in January this year and subsequently signed a non-disclosure agreement. \n\nSahara’s local representative Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the judicial manager toured the plant in Gweru. In July, Sahara advised that it had established an investment vehicle in Mauritius called Ekhaya Investments, to focus on the financing structure of the deal. \n\nEkhaya would mandate Trustlink International Limited (an asset management company) of Mauritius to package the transaction.\n\nMilitala said a second tour was conducted leading to Ekhaya appointing a local consultancy firm, Quest Consultants, as financial advisors. \n\nOn August 26, Quest Consultants, Militala said, made a conditional offer on behalf of Ekhaya amounting to $3 million in cash for the purchase of book assets of Zimglass as opposed to the business. \n\n"They prefer to go for the assets and this can only be made possible by liquidation. It’s best prudent that the provisional liquidator should widen the takers to get better value to benefit all stakeholders," he said. \n\nAn employee opted for debt-equity swap and to allow the company to operate saying that liquidation would result in losses.\n\nIn response, Militala said the continued judicial management would erode the remaining assets and that non-secured creditors may walk away with nothing. \n\nThe IDC which was represented in the meeting, said government as a shareholder had no capacity to rescue the company.\n\nAmong the creditors who supported the liquidation was AfrAsia Bank.\n\nOther banks owed are ZB Bank ($3,3 million), Agribank ($630 000), FBC Bank ($1,8 million) and IDCSA-Agribank ($11, 2 million).\n\nAt the end of the meeting creditors voted on whether or not the company should go into liquidation. The results of the vote will be announced today amid indications that the majority of creditors supported liquidation.\n\nA subsidiary of IDC, Zimglass manufactures glass packaging material for alcoholic and sparkling beverages, food, liquor and pharmaceutical segments. Its major domestic customers included Delta Beverages, African Distillers, Mutare Bottling Company, Straitia Investments, Olivine Industries, Datlabs and E Snell and Company.
0454_224f28f0-18af-40e5-be16-42093d42fab9	When the MacBook Air came out in 2008, it was considered the standard for ultra-portable notebooks. The MacBook Air took a couple years for commercial acceptance, but it took off in a way that nobody had ever expected. The MacBook Air led to the creation of the competing Intel Ultrabook, but none of the Intel or Windows-powered devices could come close to matching the Air’s success. \n \nThings have changed in the past couple of years and the MacBook Air may not be the unique device it used to be. Microsoft’s Surface Pro took a couple of generations to take off, but the Surface Pro 3, released in June of 2014, was the first device that was easily seen as a MacBook Air killer. Tech Times wrote an article last year on the topic. \n \n“It appears though that Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is being put in competition against Apple products such as the iPad and MacBook Air. Based on a few reviews gathered, Microsoft’s latest baby is a killer.” \n \nThen, there is the Dell XPS 13 , which Computerworld thought was a much better buy than the MacBook Air. \n \n“Dell’s new XPS13 is a MacBook Air killer that shoehorns a 13-inch screen into a bezel that would normally hold an 11-inch panel. The new laptop also features Intel’s new Broadwell U CPU and a high-resolution touch screen.” \n \nThe main thing holding the Surface Pro 3 and XPS 13 back was the much-disliked Windows 8 operating system. However, now that both devices come with the much-acclaimed Windows 10, they continue to take away customers who would have normally purchased a MacBook Air. \n \nHowever, it’s not just Windows devices that are taking attention away from the MacBook Air. Earlier this year, Apple released the ultra-light 12-inch MacBook, which has a Retina screen (unlike the MacBook Air) and has an updated design. As BGR says, the device that may really kill off the MacBook Air is the iPad Pro , due to be announced this week. \n \n“Effectively, the iPad Pro could be turned into a MacBook killer, a product that would rival similarly sized MacBooks and other laptops. That’s assuming Apple and its partners can deliver on the software side.” \n \nThe “software” side could be a huge issue, given that, unlike the MacBook Air, the iPad Pro won’t be running a full desktop operating system. However, iOS is more than adequate for many, who just need a device for word processing, Internet surfing, and multimedia capabilities. The MacBook Air will always have a place in technology history, even if it isn’t quite relevant like it was five years ago. \n \n[Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News] \n \nApple MacBook Air Becoming Less Relevant Due To Surface Pro 3, MacBook, iPad Pro And Dell XPS 13 is an article from: The Inquisitr News
0455_3d9f70b5-46e0-49f8-8679-15d8eee94a92	Green Tree International, Inc., the parent company of Amercanex, the American Cannabis Exchange, today announced that former Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) CEO Gordon Rutledge, along with fellow former NYMEX Board Member James McNally have joined their former NYMEX colleagues Richard Schaeffer and David Greenberg at Amercanex.

0456_78027d6d-8894-4e8e-aaef-2bc835961838	Floome recently provided me with a breathalyzer to review as an alternative to doing blood alcohol content(BAC) levels based on height and weight. I jumped at the opportunity, because I am a social drinker and don’t ever want to drive drunk. It’s simply not worth the consequences. For many, it is easy to say, “I’m good to drive. It’s just five minutes away” when they are drinking, but those five minutes can be life changing. \n \nIf you get caught over the legal limit for a first time offender in California, according to Nolo ,(laws vary from state to state) and you did not cause a crash, you can get off easy with a $390 fine plus over $1000 in penalty assessments. It doesn’t stop there with an additional DUI-only $1800 penalties, a 48-hour jail sentence or a 90-day license restriction allowing you to only drive to and from work, and to and from an alcohol treatment program. You will also be required to complete an alcohol treatment program, and possibly get even up to six months in jail. \n \nThe reason why I say that you would get off easy is because there are even more severe consequences of driving under the influence. You can possibly give multiple people life sentences if you crash and kill them. Even if you cause a crash and do not kill someone, but do injure them, you can face jail time on top of fines and it could be considered a felony based on your situation. Plain and simple, don’t be selfish and endanger others just because you wanted to have a good time. Here are some facts courtesy of MADD (Mother’s against drunk driving). \n The Floome is a breathalyzer designed to be used with your smartphone, is made by 2045 Tech and is sold in the US, Canada, Europe and Japan. 2045 Tech only uses the highest-quality parts for the Floome: The sensor used in the Floome to determine BAC is the same as the ones used in breathalyzers of law enforcement officers. Its purpose is to help you get the most accurate BAC level using your breath, app on your smartphone and of course, the Floome.  Design  \nThe Floome is about the size of a key fob used in automobiles today. If you can carry a car key, you can carry the Floome. It is definitely portable and is well built. It comes in glossy red and matte black for those of you who are conscious about the devices you use as the Floome definitely fits the high-end design category. \n \nEverything you need is contained in the one device. 2045 Tech designed the Floome to be simple and durable which is perfect for party goers and social drinkers alike. No battery is required to power the Floome, which means no charging and worrying about it not working without power. \n \n\n Setup  Floome (Playboard) | Floome (Play Store)  \nIn order to use the Floome, you need to download the required app from Google Play or the App Store as this is compatible with both Android and iOS. Once installed, you need to create an account, and then you can plug the Floome into your audio jack and get testing. \n Usage  \nIn order to use your Floome, the app will require you to enter your weight, gender, height and age, and the app will calculate how long it should take your body to lower your BAC. In addition, with increased usage, the app will learn your metabolic rate as everyone’s body is different. After you have been drinking, you need to wait twenty minutes before your test results will be accurate. The alcohol in your mouth can distort the results, but on the plus side, it will give you a higher reading than you actually expect which means it will tell you not to drive. \n \nOnce I filled in the necessary information, I took a baseline reading before I got to partying by myself. As expected my first reading was .000 g/dL which means I had no alcohol in my system. \n \nAfter my initial reading, which required a gentle blow into the Floome for a few seconds, I started to drink my Scotch. To test the Floome, I took another test after thirty seconds of waiting. Like I said before, I was supposed to wait 20 minutes before I took my first test, but for the sake of the review I wanted to see what would happen if I broke the rule. My BAC came in at a whopping .167 where the legal limit is .08 which means I was double the legal limit. \n \nAfter waiting the full twenty minutes and after finishing my two ounce drink, I took the test again and my reading came in at .017 g/dL. The Floome app let me know that my driving could be impaired which I do not disagree with. After pouring myself another, drinking it, and testing again my BAC came in at .033 which meant it was time for me to stop drinking. I normally only have one or two drinks when I go out and at my weight and time spent drinking over 75 minutes, the Floome definitely matched up to BAC calculators. I have full confidence that the Floome was giving me an accurate reading. \n \nNow I know you’re probably thinking, why would I get the Floome if I can use a BAC calculator? When you are out and having fun, do you find yourself keeping track of what time you started drinking? Do you keep track of exactly how much alcohol is in your craft beer(craft beers in San Diego easily push 6-8% alcohol content)? Was it a double shot or was it a single shot of whiskey? None of these things are easy to track and relying on calculators just isn’t accurate. Plus if you are aware enough to keep track of all of those things, there’s a good chance you are a responsible drinker anyways. \n \nThe Floome does whatever it can to prevent you from driving over the legal limit by suggesting restaurants you can go eat at, providing a taxi finding service, as well as connecting you to your contacts so they can give you a ride. \n What I liked   Simple to use  Accuracy  Build quality  No battery required  Portable  Well executed app  Compatible with Android and iOS   What I didn’t like   Nothing. I am going to buy a couple for my buddies.   Summary  \nThe Floome costs $99.00 which is a bargain considering the alternatives. Not only will it help you stay away from fines, but more importantly it will help prevent crashes and save lives. Drunk driving is all too common in this world and many of you probably know someone who has been affected by a drunk driver in some way. If you haven’t, consider yourself fortunate and don’t become a statistic. \n \nUse the Floome if you are a drinker, or get one for your friends and family if you know them to be irresponsible when it comes to drinking. No one deserves a life sentence at the hands of a drunk driver. \n \n\n\n \n\n\n EVERY TWO MINUTES, A PERSON IS INJURED IN A DRUNK DRIVING CRASH.

0457_72134390-0e39-424c-90f2-225d36da608a	PESHAWAR: In what appea­red to be a precisely planned and executed attack, terrorists displayed their ability to breach the security of an Air Force camp near here on Friday and carried out one of the deadliest assaults on a defence installation on the southern fringes of the provincial capital. \n\nTwenty-nine people, among them personnel of the Pakistan Air Force and military and some civilians, lost their lives and all 13 militants who had stormed the camp were also killed. \n\nThe Darra Adamkhel chapter of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack. \n\nBuilt by the United States in the late 1950s to eavesdrop on Soviet communications and conduct air surveillance on the Soviet Union, Badaber is no longer an operation camp. It now serves mainly as a residential area housing quarters for PAF personnel and a public school. \n\nIn a five-minute, twenty-nine seconds video sent to reporters on Friday, the TTP group’s leader Khalifa Mansoor alias Omar Naray is seen saying goodbye to a group of 16 militants which, it said, was departing for the attack on the PAF camp. \n\nThe group now based in Afghanistan was also behind the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December last year which left 145 people dead, 136 of them students. \n\nIt was also behind a suicide bombing outside the offices of the local administration in Jamrud in Khyber tribal region early this month, resulting in the death of three people. \n\nSecurity officials said the group affiliated with the Mullah Fazlullah’s TTP was emerging as the single major threat originating from Afghanistan. \n\nISPR Director General Maj Gen Asim Bajwa stopped short of blaming the Afghan government for “encouraging the attack”, but he did acknowledge that the attack was organised in Afghanistan and originated from there. “I don’t think the Afghan government or state could sponsor the attack. We have brotherly relations with Afghanistan,” he said at a news conference in Peshawar. \nISPR says 29 defence personnel and civilians killed; all assailants eliminated  \nBut security officials dealing with terrorism said that there had been an uptick in the number of terrorist attacks in tribal regions straddling the border after relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan took a nose dive. Kabul accused Islamabad of being behind violence in Afghanistan. \n\n“Whatever little the Afghans were doing, they are no longer doing. This means a freehand to the Pakistani militants operating on their side of the border,” an official said. \n\nPolice and military personnel said a group of militants drove to the main entrance, lobbed hand-grenades and fired at the guardroom before entering the camp. But they were engaged by the second line of defence, restricting them to the Mechanised Transport Section. \n\n“This was the area which turned into the main battle zone,” a security official said, requesting he not be named. \n\n“Had militants managed and succeeded in overrunning the second line of defence, they would surely have gone towards the main residential quarters and we would have seen carnage,” he said. “The Quick Response Force and those deployed inside the camp did a wonderful and heroic job,” he said, adding that eight of the militants were killed there. \n\n“For the first time all standing operating procedures were followed, otherwise people would have forgotten the APS attack,” he said. \n\nAfter facing resistance, the militants headed for a mosque in the camp at about 5.20am, shooting indiscriminately and tossing hand-grenades, killing sixteen people who were waiting for the early morning prayers to begin. The militants then went to the adjacent barracks, where they shot more people preparing for the prayers, the official said. \n \nThe militants carrying backpacks were armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, hand-grenades and improvised explosive devices, the official said. “None of them was wearing suicide vests. They were not suicide bombers. They had come to fight a long battle and fight till the last bullet,” said the official who had seen the bodies of the militants. \n\nMaj Gen Asim Bajwa said at the press conference that 13 attackers tried to break deep into the base and that security forces engaged and contained them around the guardroom area. He said that 29 people, including 22 PAF personnel, three army soldiers and four civilians, were killed in the attack. Capt Asfandyar Bukhari of the army and three FAF technicians were among the dead. \n\nThe ISPR chief said the Quick Response Force, army commandos and PAF troops fought the militants while police were outside the camp in outer cordon. \n\nThe military spokesman said the terrorists had entered the camp from two points and later split into sub-groups. He said that due to quick response from security forces, the militants were contained in a close area, while one group rushed to the mosque and killed 16 worshippers. All the 13 militants wearing constabulary uniforms were killed in the encounter. He said three aviation helicopters had also taken part in clearance and evacuation of casualties. \n\nAccording to a security official, one of the helicopters crashed inside the camp because of some technical fault, but its crew remained safe. \n\n“There have been constant threat alerts and threat assessments about possible terrorist attacks in Peshawar and other places, including the Badaber camp,” another security official said. \n\nBut Maj Gen Bajwa denied that there was any specific threat against the camp. The last threat alert about a possible attack was issued on Sept 8. \n\nWajid Ali, an officer of the Frontier Constabulary’s QRF, told journalists at the Lady Reading Hospital that security forces had engaged the militants soon after they had entered the camp. They killed four of the attackers and injured two. \n \nSuliman, another officer, told Dawn that he was among the first responders who rushed to the site following the attack. He said that they could not enter the camp because of intense fire. \n\nA rescue official requesting anonymity told Dawn that his team received more than 30 injuries within the camp, while there were about 25 dead bodies. “I counted at least 16 dead bodies in the mosque,” he said, adding that the mosque was badly damaged as militants had used hand-grenades, besides opening fire at the security personnel. “It was gut wrenching scene inside the mosque,” the official said. Ten to 12 vehicles were also destroyed after catching fire. \n\nHe said the attackers were wearing black dress, akin to those worn by FC personnel, and joggers and some of them were carrying yellow backpacks. “Almost all the attackers were in their late twenties and thirties,” he said. \n\nShah Zeb, a local resident, told Dawn that he woke up because of heavy firing and intense blasts. He said that when he came out of his house, he saw smoke billowing out of the camp and military and police personnel rushing to the area. \n\nHe said security forces had about one and a half years ago shifted some 15 houses located very close to the camp. \n\nMeanwhile, funeral prayers of the slain personnel were offered at the Peshawar Corps Headquarters. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Army Chief Gen Raheel Sharif, PAF Chief Sohail Aman and senior military and civil officials attended the prayers. \n\nEarlier, chiefs of the army and the air force visited the PAF camp and met security personnel who took part in the operation. \n\nPublished in Dawn, September 19th, 2015 \n\nOn a mobile phone?

0458_c55b5b65-79d8-4cb9-87fd-060adb6e7a7b	If selectors do not pick Peter Siddle to share pace duties in Bangladesh early next month, they will be consigning Australia to fielding their most inexperienced Test line-up since the World Series Cricket split. \n\nManchester: If selectors do not pick Peter Siddle to share pace duties in Bangladesh early next month they will be consigning Australia to fielding their most inexperienced Test line-up since the World Series Cricket split.\n\nIgnored until the last match of the Ashes series and seemingly out of consideration, the 30-year-old has become a more attractive proposition for the series in Bangladesh. That is through a combination of being sufficiently resilient to cope with being just one of two specialist seamers, and because with the retirement of Michael Clarke and the resting of Mitch Johnson he would comfortably be the most-capped player in the team.\n\nAustralia will have to cope with at least the absence of three players with more than 200 Tests between them: Clarke, Johnson and Chris Rogers. If you add David Warner to that, based on the opener's expectation he will miss the entire series due to a fractured thumb, players with a total of 254 Tests between them will be missing.\n\nEven if selectors turn to previously tried batsmen, such as Shaun Marsh and Usman Khawaja, to fill the batting vacancies they will be struggling to field an XI that has played a combined total of 200 matches, a tally they have exceeded in every Test since December 1987.\n\nIf they overlooked Siddle, who has played 57 Tests and is only two wickets from reaching his 200-wicket milestone, the tally will drop below 150, with off-spinner Nathan Lyon (46 Tests) and new captain Steve Smith (33) the most experienced of a conspicuously inexperienced bunch. The combined total of players' experience has not been so low since the late 1970s, when many star players instead played in the breakaway competition run by the late Kerry Packer.\n\nThere will be at least three - and almost certainly four - necessary changes between the final Ashes Test at the Oval to the first in Chittagong, with Clarke, Rogers, Johnson and probably Warner out. In the past 30 years the most changes made by Australia in consecutive Tests was six, between Bangalore against India in March 1998 and Rawalpindi in Pakistan in October 1998. Current Australia coach Darren Lehmann was one of the minority of players (five) from Bangalore to have played in the next Test, too.\n\nKhawaja has been nominated by former Australia captain Ricky Ponting as the batsman most deserving of promotion to the Test team outside the Ashes squad. He recently captained Australia A in a series in India.\n\nMarsh failed twice in his only Test appearance of the Ashes, and while the combination of his mediocre record (he averaged 33.12 after 15 Tests) and his age (32) have led to calls for him to be permanently discarded, selectors could be swayed by his good record on comparable pitches to what are expected in Bangladesh. The left-hander has played a lot in India, mainly in IPL, and in his debut Test series in Sri Lanka four years ago he thrived with scores of 141, 81 and 18. Before the Ashes he made 69 in his last innings of the West Indies series.\n\nThe reputed lead contender to succeed Rogers as Test opener, Joe Burns, insisted he was not being distracted by the issue of the looming selection of the squad for Bangladesh, and was instead focusing on the one-dayers in England.\n\n"I guess there is a lot of opportunity there, but when you're playing series like this it's not something you're really thinking about. All you're doing is focusing on your next training session, your next game ... you want to play well for your country and, hopefully, win a series for Australia," Burns told ESPNcricinfo. "It's not something that keeps any player up at night, worrying about future selections or anything like that."\n\nAustralia Twenty20 captain Aaron Finch said the looming turnover of batsman was a fillip for batsmen desperate to play Test cricket.\n\n"I think it's an exciting time for Australian cricket with a few of the senior players moving aside. It gives everyone confidence that if they're playing well and in form, no matter what format of the game or where you're playing, you'll most likely be selected ... I think that gives everyone around the country a real buzz that they know they're not far away," said Finch, who rejoined the one-day squad as Warner flew home. "They know they might be a couple of a good scores from potentially playing Test cricket ... that drives everyone, makes everyone strive to be better and be in as good a form as they can." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0459_e6ad171f-fc09-4098-b669-8ce4b4a284f9	By Sept. 12, 2015, 1:46 a.m. exit \nAuburn Deputy Mayor Salim Mehajer is facing a push to dump him as treasurer of the body representing western Sydney councils, amid fears the controversy following his lavish wedding could reflect poorly on the organisation. \n\nCr Mehajer is treasurer of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, which receives about $650,000 in membership fees from its 10 member councils each year. \n\nAccording to its most recent annual report, WSROC led the issuing of $31.7 million in contracts last financial year. \n\nAt a meeting on Thursday night, WSROC board member and Penrith councillor Marcus Cornish proposed that the directors consider whether Cr Mehajer should be removed as treasurer. \n\nCr Cornish was concerned the focus on Cr Mehajer's business and political dealings in the wake of his wedding could reflect badly on WSROC. \n\nCr Mehajer's wedding caused a storm of protest after he blocked off a Lidcombe street for the celebration, which featured helicopters, a jet and a fleet of luxury cars. \n\nIt led to the NSW government promising to scrap a law allowing councillors - including developers such as Cr Mehajer - to vote on planning controls from which they could benefit, even if they declared their interest. \n\nBut WSROC chairman, Liverpool councillor Tony Hadchiti, blocked the move because it was not on the official agenda. \n\n"I think it would be unfair for anybody to be ambushed," he said. \n\nCr Hadchiti said Cr Mehajer had been "a great executive member" in his time as treasurer. \n\n"Putting his private dealings aside, he has only ever acted in a professional manner." \n\nOn Friday, Cr Mehajer said that despite the push to remove him "I will not be distracted from my role as treasurer and I will continue to do what I do best - serving my community and the people of Western Sydney". \n\n"I will continue working to the best of my ability with the WSROC board, executive committee and staff  to achieve exceptional results." \n\nThe meeting also confirmed that former Strathfield MP Charles Casuscelli has been appointed as chief executive of WSROC, following an external recruitment process. \n\nMr Casuscelli lost his seat to Labor's Jodi McKay at the March state election. \n\nThe three-year contract pays between $235,000 and $265,000 a year - in excess of $100,000 more than Mr Casuscelli earned as a Liberal backbencher. \n\nOn Thursday night, the executive presented Mr Casuscelli as the preferred candidate to the WSROC board, which unanimously endorsed the appointment. \n\nAccording to board minutes, the executive selected four other candidates to interview for the role including Labor MP Steve Whan. \n\nThe story Push to dump Salim Mehajer as treasurer of western Sydney council body first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .
0460_948a600a-4b2c-4b0a-aaf7-7ec605bb70bc	Turkmenistan News.Net Wednesday 9th September, 2015 \n\nGRAYSON, Kentucky - Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to give gay marriage certificates and was jailed in contempt of court, was released from prison after five days on Tuesday. \n\nDavis emerged out of the prison to a cheering crowd of hundreds of her supporters at a rally outside the Carter County Detention Center that clogged traffic in this small town and dominated cable news for much of the day.\n\nProminent social conservatives flocked to Grayson. Mike Huckabee, the Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas governor and rival Senator Ted Cruz mingled with the crowd. \n\nDavis spoke briefly to the rally here, where she had been held. She walked on stage to thunderous applause, the song "Eye of the Tiger" playing, her hands held aloft in triumph by her lawyer, Mathew D. Staver and Huckabee.\n\n"Thank you all so much, I love you all so very much," said an emotional Davis. "I just want to give God the glory. His people have rallied and you are a strong people. Just keep on pressing. Don't let down. Because He is here."\n\nJudge David Bunning of Federal District Court sent Davis to jail last Thursday for defying his order on issuing same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nBut in a two-page order Tuesday, the judge said that he would release her because he was satisfied that her office was "fulfilling its obligation to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples". \n\nFive of Davis' deputies in the Rowan County Clerk's Office have been issuing marriage licenses since Friday.\n\nBut the release order came with a stern warning. "Defendant Davis shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples," and that the deputies would report to him every two weeks.\n\n"If Defendant Davis should interfere in any way with their issuance, that will be considered a violation of this order and appropriate sanctions will be considered."\n\nBut Davis' attorney Mat Staver told reporters that her release had settled nothing.\n\n"Kim Davis cannot, (and) will not violate her conscience," said Staver, founder of the conservative Liberty Counsel.\n\nAsked if that meant she would refuse to issue licenses, he promised that people would "find out in the near future," perhaps the next day.\n\n"She loves God, she loves people, she loves her work, and she will not betray any of those three," Staver said.\n\nDavis's fight took a political overtone and gave the presidential contenders a clear chance to prove their conservative mettle in a crowded primary field.\n\nThey anointed Davis a hero of religious liberty, casting her defiance of a Supreme Court ruling as an expression of faith and a constitutional right.
0461_c81a27b9-8c1e-4952-9630-5b0cec1b1495	Martin Luther King Day weekend unleashed the megahit “American Sniper” on multiplexes, along with major studio releases “Blackhat” and “The Wedding Ringer.” President’s Day weekend brought “Fifty Shades of Grey” and “Kingsman: The Secret Service,” which combined to earn $975 million at the global box office. Heck, even National Ice Cream Day weekend yielded “Ant-Man” and “Trainwreck.” But for Labor Day weekend, three days when the vast majority of Americans are off work, the only new wide release is “The Transporter Refueled.” Yikes! With that in mind, here’s a look back at my 10 favorite movies of the summer that you can check out instead. Some of them are available on home video, some are hanging on in a few theaters and a couple are still dominating the box office. 10. “Dope”/”Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”: This one’s a two-fer, because in many ways, they’re the same movie: Sundance sensations focusing on pop-culture obsessed high school seniors that disappointed at the box office. But they’re both worth seeking out. “Dope” for the ’90s hip-hop-loving Malcolm (Shameik Moore), who proves once and for all that not everyone from South Central L.A. is as tough as the streets. And “Earl” for its shoestring-budget movie parodies like “2:48 p.m. Cowboy,” which still makes me giggle. 9. “Amy”: In an era when even superhero movies have trouble portraying memorable villains, the documentary chronicling the rise and fall of Amy Winehouse trotted out three of the year’s most compelling bad guys as the singer’s father, husband and manager seemed to be in a competition to see who could deliver the most devastating betrayal of her trust. 8. “Straight Outta Compton”: The reigning box-office champ isn’t as brash, raw and in your face as its subjects, N.W.A. But it’s close. 7. “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”: You still have to wonder why, in an era when Sony is making a movie based on emojis, studio executives thought they could generate buzz with a film version of a barely remembered 1960s TV spy drama starring B-list (at best) actors. Having said that, “U.N.C.L.E.” was stylishly entertaining and surprisingly funny. 6. “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation”: Much like “U.N.C.L.E.,” this 1960s TV retread seemed like a bad idea when the franchise debuted in 1996. But it’s always had a not-so-secret weapon in Tom Cruise, who, for the latest installment, repeatedly strapped himself to the outside of a military transport plane during takeoff. When everyone else is relying on green screens and computers, Cruise consistently risks his life in these practical stunts, and the results are thrilling. 5. “Magic Mike XXL”: There’s zero plot. There’s no antagonist, no denouement. There’s barely any conflict or adversity. And there’s certainly no character growth. “XXL” flies in the face of so many basic Hollywood rules, it could be mistaken for an experiment in deconstruction by an avant-garde Danish film collective. The result is so surreal, though, it’s almost genius — or at least as genius as two hours of dry humping can be. Page 2 of 2 - 4. “Jurassic World”: Chris Pratt is solid, Jake Johnson is hilarious and Bryce Dallas Howard, depending on whom you ask, is either ludicrous or a feminist icon for running around the jungles of Isla Nublar in heels. But the best things about this cool blast of nostalgia are the goofy “Godzilla”-style ending and that ridiculous, “Yo, I got this” head nod from raptor Blue. 3. “Ex Machina”: This intimate, unsettling look at artificial intelligence is part love story, part science experiment. Thanks to its extraordinary leading lady (“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’s” Alicia Vikander), the modestly budgeted film brought a robot to life in ways the following week’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron” simply couldn’t, despite having spent something like eleventy billion dollars on its titular RoboSpader. 2. “Inside Out”: Someday you’ll be able to explain to your kids why, while they were busy laughing at the cotton-candy elephant Bing Bong or the antics at the Hollywood-style Dream Productions, you were quietly weeping at this animated tale of an 11-year-old girl and her emotions. 1. “Mad Max: Fury Road”: Much like “Magic Mike XXL,” there’s very little plot. It’s basically the big-screen equivalent of an 8-year-old playing with a bunch of rusted toy cars in a sandbox. But the two hours of rolling thunder is exquisitely filmed by the franchise’s caretaker, George Miller, making “Fury Road” the summer’s most dazzling experience.
0462_5ff9eb4f-0305-47a9-aab9-f25000b1a4f2	By | Sportskeeda  –    \nBanno can scarcely hold back tears about her predicament (Source: Muslimissues ) \n\n \nIf Indian sports (other than a couple) were Greek tragedies, they would probably make Euripides jealous. Details about endorsements with more digits than you know how to count and articles about the number of wheels sportspersons own make not infrequent appearances in media. In heartrending contrast comes the story of Ruksar Banno, an erstwhile women’s national level boxing champion from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.  \n \nBanno has participated in more than 12 state championships and has an impressive collection of medals as credentials. Banno’s father states that his daughter’s ambition is to become like Mary Kom. But desperate, earnest appeals to senior sports officials, the sports minister, the chief minister and even the prime minister have apparently fallen on deaf ears as Banno continues to barely eak out a living making kites. The arduous work of making 1000 kites a day yields a daily wage of just Rs. 80, which she does, regardless, in the hopes of financing her boxing dreams. \n \nThis comes close on the heels of another former boxing champion from the state, Kamal Kumar Valmiki. The 3-time district level gold medallist who also won a bronze medal at the Uttar Pradesh State Boxing Championships is forced to work as a garbage collector and a part-time rickshaw puller to sustain himself and his family. He aspired to become a coach at a state level academy but couldn’t due to financial constraints.  \n \nWhile some of her peers celebrate medal wins at the recently concluded Asian Boxing Championships and others are busy training for the upcoming India level Camp Boxing Championship in Vishakhapatnam, the facilities available to Banno are not even rudimentary. She cannot afford shoes and tracksuits to train, which might seem a luxury to the sole breadwinner of her family.  \n \nThere seems to be a general sentiment of upswing in the newly robust economy, but amidst all the brouhaha, the voices of a few deserving toilers have evidently been smothered. The government continues to rely on euphoria to fuel its attempts to turn around the economy. But it needs to realise that those nations at the top of the economic food chain do not endeavour to advance economic growth, which is purely monetary, but economic development, which is encompassing of all the aspects of a nation. \n Originally published on Sportskeeda.com here
0463_d0f47548-516e-49ec-8990-8d9561eefd8a	It’s ironic that hunting for an app in an App Store or Play Store works like a browser search engine. App discovery is possibly one of the biggest problems both consumers and publishers face. In order to make this easier WhichApp was born. It’s about the apps that are there and the ones that should be there. It helps you find apps that your friends use. \n \nWhichApp believes that the app stores aren’t built with the mobile-first consumer in mind. Even for more evolved users, word of mouth from friends and family is the top way to find apps. Besides, socially recommended users for any app have the highest user quality score among all marketing and acquisition channels. WhichApp automates this word of mouth, but keeping user’s experience and privacy as most important. \n \n\n \n  \n The team’s eureka moment  \nKapil Chawla and Pradeep Paijwar had begun their careers together in the research team at C-DAC. After that the duo went in different directions, but got back together when Kapil decided to startup PingOO – a rewards network for mobile games and apps with Asad Raza and Sambhrant Sahajpal. It was this team that got together to start WhichApp. \n \nIt was during PingOO days, when the team spoke to app and game publishers, everyone’s challenge was being discovered. “And then suddenly we realised if I could know what my friends (and possibly friends of friends) are using that could be interesting and a graph of the usage their apps and their friends apps would be of immense value. We spoke to a few hundred users and sought their feedback. The response was very encouraging and WhichApp took shape,” says Kapil. \n \n\n  \nAlso Read:  How an incompatible charging problem built SPEC Invent \n  \n  \n Addressing the elephant in the room  \nKapil believes that most are currently focussed on monetising their media inventory for app install ads, and very few are making attempts at solving App discovery. Kapil says that one company which is solving the App Search as a problem is Quixey. \n \nFundamentally, Kapil says, search and discovery are different sides of the same coin leading to a transaction. He adds that launchers and productivity apps like Hola Launcher, Apus and Aviate are another way the problem can be attempted. “We’ve been focussed on iterating and learning before we push for user growth,” says Kapil. \n Traction  \nThe app has had close to one lakh downloads and most of them are friends of existing users. Kapil says that for a social product like theirs’ it is very critical to crack the social graph and much needed virality, which they have been able to do to a good extent and hope to push the viral factor with the next release. \n \n“And the hypothesis that users will find information about apps that their friends use has been proven. We are seeing a trend where the inherent dynamics of app stores – rich get richer while the poor get poorer are getting disrupted,” adds Kapil. \n  \nAlso Read:  BITS Pilani alumni build fetal monitoring devices to address 3,00,000 annual perinatal deaths in India \n  \n  \n Building the team  \nHe adds that the team doesn’t incentivise their users either installs apps or invite their friends. They’ve had a few app publishers approach them for promoting their apps, but right now the team is not looking to monetise and are focussed only on the consumer and their experience. \n \nKapil says they are a lean team and all of them work across the stack in their specific domain. “We hire for attitude and passion and empower people to punch way above their weight. Culture is informal yet focussed on high performance and ownership,” adds Kapil. \n Growth and plans  \nThe team has raised a small seed round mostly from friends and a couple of angels. These include Vikram Chachra (Eight Capital), Ravi Srivastava (Purvi Capital), Pallav Pandey and some executives from companies like PwC, Cisco, JP Morgan, and Practo. \n \nKapil says they’ve had their learnings from the initial phase of the product rollout and are focussed on improving the user experience and fixing the gaps. India is their primary and first market but they believe this is a global opportunity and product. “Once we are comfortable, we will launch the product for other android markets as well in mid Q1 2016. We aim to cross five million users by December 2016 for India,” adds Kapil. \n YourStory take  \nWith close to 1.4 million apps in the Play Store and 1.5 million in the App Store, app discovery is one of the biggest discussions among marketers. Many believe that standing out in a store will continue to be more challenging. It is in fact believed that close to 83 per cent of the apps are Zombie of apps that just do not appear on the top lists. While a definite problem, will another platform solve the problem? \n \nApp
0464_27c190d5-43de-49f4-b3c4-22ea965f3cfd	There is something amazingly symbolic about Congress considering the Obama- Khamenei agreement on the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attack. \n\nVirtually every lesson Americans learned painfully that day has been forgotten in the rush to sign an agreement with the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. \n\nFourteen years ago, the World Trade Center collapsed, the Pentagon was hit and a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania. The nation was horrified and enraged. \n\nWe learned that we could be surprised. \n\nWe learned that our enemies hated us and wanted to kill us. \n\nWe learned that our enemies were good at long term planning and at deception. \n\nWe learned once again that the military and intelligence communities play a vital role in keeping us safe. \n\nNow, 14 years later, the president and his allies are ignoring every one of these lessons. \n\nThey are pushing for an agreement that assumes we can trust our mortal enemies and that assumes paper treaties and international bureaucrats can keep us safe. \n\nThey are pressuring their elected allies to side with them in this surrender to the Ayatollah Khameini even when those allies know it is a terrible and dangerous idea. \n\nForget the harsh language of the opponents. Listen to what the supporters of the deal are saying. \n\nFirst, our “partner” in this agreement, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei , on Wednesday reminded us that he views America as “the Great Satan” and vowed that Israel will be eliminated within 25 years. He said : \n\n[Ayatollah] Khomeini called America ‘the Great Satan.’ That is a very wise saying … Satan only deceives man, but the U.S. deceives, murders, and imposes sanctions … After the nuclear talks were over, I heard that the Zionists in occupied Palestine had said: ‘In the meantime, thanks to the results of the talks, we will have 25 years of quiet regarding the problem of Iran. After 25 years, we will think of something.’ I respond to them by saying: ‘First of all, in 25 years you will not be alive.’…God willing, in 25 years there will be no such thing as the Zionist regime in the region, and secondly, during this period, the fighting Islamic spirit will not give the Zionists even a single day of serenity…” \n\nWhen the leader you are trying to trust tells you before the agreement is ratified that he will destroy Israel and he will continue to preach “Death to America,” you have to wonder what he will say after it is approved. \n\nOur enemies’ assessment of the deal is alarming enough. But some of the best arguments against it come from its supporters here in the United States.

I love this woman!! Many more baby!!” Diaz married Madden in January 2015 after years of enjoying the single life. Cameron now wants to have a baby, and has been the target of pregnancy rumors for the past few months. Happy Birthday to my Beautiful Wife❤My best friend and Everything else- there’s so much I could write. I’m the luckiest guy alive- I get to spend the rest of my life right here. I love this Woman!!❤️Many more Baby!! ❤️  A photo posted by The B-man (@benjaminmadden) on Aug 30, 2015 at 4:30pm PDT At 43, Cameron has a sensational bikini body. Diaz’s anti-aging fitness secrets are low-carb diet, running, weightlifting, yoga and Pilates workouts, Examiner reported. “The fountain of youth: I guess it’s exercise, healthy diet, lots of water, lots of laughter, lots of sex. Yes, sex!” said Diaz. “It’s healthy, it’s natural. It’s what we are here to do!” Cameron said regular exercise is a critical component to keeping her youthful. “You have to just do it,” Diaz said of working out.“Once you commit and really put in the effort, your body goes, ‘Oh, it’s not okay to be without this.’ People say, ‘My body rejects exercise.’ No it doesn’t. Your mind rejects exercise.” Cameron doesn’t believe in starving herself, but follows a low-carb diet to stay model-skinny and healthy. Low-carb diets such as the ketogenic and Atkins diets fuel rapid weight loss by inducing the body to burn fat fuel, said Jeff Volek, author of the Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living. Obesity expert Dr. Eric Westman, co-author of Keto Clarity, agrees. Westman has helped hundreds of morbidly obese people lose thousands of pounds on the low-carb ketogenic, Atkins and Paleo diets. Cameron underscored that you don’t have to deprive or starve yourself to look or feel your best. “Well-being is an equation,” said Diaz. “You don’t have to have the whole cake, you can have a piece. Diaz added: “Don’t deprive yourself. Have fun. Just be self-aware. If your equation is 80% good, 20% bad most of the time, then a little movement toward the center isn’t going to affect you much.” Cameron Diaz shares her weight loss, diet, workout, beauty and happiness secrets in her bestseller, The Body Book.

0469_d6713186-b801-4506-adc6-d97e686b5b41	WASHINGTON — Pope Francis ascends Capitol Hill Thursday to make history as the first Vatican leader to address a joint meeting of Congress, a feat unimaginable a quarter century ago.\n\nFrancis will address members of the House of Representatives and the Senate as a head of state – the leader of the Holy See. But his message to the packed House chamber will be conveyed in spiritual tones, and carry political overtones.\n\nThe leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics speaks to a divided Congress locked in fierce debates over climate change, immigration, the Syrian refugee crisis, the nuclear deal with Iran and abortion.\n\nCongressional Democrats and Republicans simultaneously view the pontiff as politically one of their own and the voice of the opposition – depending on the issue.\n\nPolitical differences aside, most lawmakers and the thousands of people who gathered outside the Capitol building were enthusiastic about seeing and hearing Francis.\n\nThe joint meeting of Congress Francis’ historic appearance on Capitol Hill has been described as a State of the Union, inauguration, and visit of a head of state rolled into one. \n\nThe House chamber and galleries overhead were packed with lawmakers, luminaries, constituents who were lucky enough to be invited to get an invitation from their House member or senator.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it,” House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a video. “There’s a lot of interest in what the pope is saying, his outreach to the poor, the fact that he thinks people ought to be more religious. He’s got other positions that are a bit more controversial, but it’s the pope.”\n\nBoehner, a devout Catholic, invited Francis to address Congress as he invited past popes. He filled his speaker’s box with friends and acquaintances with Catholic ties or impacted by the church.\n\nAmong his guests box were the mother of Paula Nowakowski, his late chief of staff; Jerry Vanden Eyden, a childhood friend of Boehner’s dating back to his Catholic school days; and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and his wife, Calista. The former speaker converted to Catholicism in 2009.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who’s also Catholic, invited her husband, Paul Pelosi; her brother, former Baltimore Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro III; and Matlilda Cuomo, wife of the late former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,\n\nAs Francis spoke in the chamber, thousands stood of guests invited by members of Congress stood outside the Capitol building’s West Front, watching the proceedings on JumboTrons.\n\n“I still think I’m dreaming, I can’t believe we are actually seeing Francisco in person,” said Ana Ruiz, 34, who came from nearby Alexandria, Va., with her mother who is visiting from Cartangena, Colombia, and her two children, Anita, 5, and Francisco, 2.\n\n“I wanted to come see this pope because he is so Christ like, because of his compassion for the poor and downtrodden,” said Charlie Burnett, 56, a Catholic schoolteacher who flew to Washington from Sparta, Wisconsin after getting a ticket from his Senator.\n\n“Today after his address he is going to eat with the homeless instead of rubbing elbows with the powerful, this is the reason why I wanted to come see him.”\n\n“Everybody is so excited here because he strikes a cord with everyone,” said Gail Randon, 66, who came with her husband from Haymarket, Virginia after scoring tickets through a lottery at their church. “He makes you feel that you could be a better person and make a change in the world.” \n\nWilliam Douglas: 202-383-6026, @williamgdouglas
0470_9ed27bd3-4915-4a43-98eb-ad238060e03f	A president needs good judgement, especially when there is confusion and controversy over things. I will contrast situations that display Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton’s judgements: \n\n1.Segregation in the early 1960s: In 1962, Bernie worked with the Congress on Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to oppose Chicago housing segregation and police brutality. In 1964, Hillary worked for Barry Goldwater, a Republican candidate, who supported continued segregation. \n\n2. Unionization: Bernie has supported and marched with unions from the beginnings of his political life as mayor of Burlington, Vt. He continues to do so now. Hillary, from 1986-1992, was a Walmart board member, who never protested as that company vigorously fought unionization. \n\n3. North American Free Trade Agreement: Bernie opposed this Clinton-passed law which sent thousands of good U.S. jobs to Mexico. It also sent cheap U.S. corn there, impoverishing thousands of Mexican small farmers. Hillary? No protest. \n\n4.Keystone XL pipeline: Bernie has consistently and forcefully opposed it, supporting the nearly unanimous scientific judgement of the danger of that oil to our world. Hillary refuses for various reasons to tell her opinion. \n\nFrom the start of his adult life, Bernie worked for racial equality and worker’s rights, and opposed bad trade deals and the destruction of our climate. Hillary, in similar situations, either didn’t see the harm or didn’t care enough. \n \nAmalie Callahan \n\nRock Island
0471_daf6f3b9-109b-42a7-b118-7670b609d51c	So I've been holding off on photographing my new swim costume because I wanted to make a boater hat to go with the ensemble. Although I have a swim cap to go with it, I wanted a decorated boater hat for any "out of water" antics.\nMost of the boater hats I viewed were decorated simply with a ribbon band, but I wanted something a little more but nothing too extravagant at the same time. While I'm making this to go with my swimsuit, I also want it for some other projects I'll eventually make. I started by purchasing a basic straw boater from Amazon.\namazon.com Accessories I purchased online from etsy, going off of how I wanted to make it so it could be used for other outfits. It took a couple of weeks, but I finally got all of my supplies gathered together just last Thursday.\nThe first thing to do was get rid of the ribbon band it came with. Thankfully it was very easy. The hard part was trying to pull off all the glue left behind. There was only a little bit left after picking as much as possible at it.\nUsing a green silk ribbon, I redid the ribbon band and used it conceal the little bit of remaining glue. I went in with a vague idea of how I wanted to decorate with the ribbon. I just started folding, angling, pinning, and voila!\nI pulled apart my leaves and flowers to eyeball how everything would look in front of the "bow." Before I could do anything with those though, the ribbon had to be tacked down.\nNow I've done a little it of millinery work with covered buckram bonnets before, but this is my first time working with straw. I was a lot easier that I thought it would be. Just make sure to use sharp needles.\nWith the ribbons pinned in place, I then used basic tacking methods to anchor the ribbons and the folds to the straw.\nNext were the leaves. I did some twisting, folding, temporary pinning, thread tacking, and a little bit of rearranging. One of the things I have found is that buying millinery flowers are much easier to work with in comparison to craft store flowers.\nLast but not least were the silk and velvet daisies. Overall, this project was completed in about 3 hours. It was nice because I had imagined it taking much longer, but this means I'll be able to do photos this upcoming weekend!\n*          *          * Notions - Pre-made straw boater hat from Amazon, green silk ribbon from Shy Myrtle, velvet leaves and daisies from A Pink Swan, and heavy duty poly thread.
0472_44d7fa1c-1cee-423c-8e1c-f29595f200bc	Son Heung-min scored a quick-fire brace on his home debut as Tottenham came from behind to beat Qarabag in their Europa League opener on Thursday night. \n \n\t\t \nThe big-money summer signing was deployed as the lone striker with goalless Harry Kane rested for the visit of the Azerbaijan champions - the first time in almost seven months the England international has not started a game for Spurs. \n  Heung-min Son bagged a brace for Tottenham   \nBut his replacement on the night showed why he was signed for a fee in excess of £20million as he scored two predatory goals in the space of three minutes to cancel out Richard Almeida's early penalty for the visitors - with Erik Lamela also in the scoresheet in the 3-1 win. \n\n\t\t\t \nSon almost slipped in Lamela only to see Qarabag goalkeeper Ibrahim Sehic come off his line and collect as his side then set about taking the early initiative. \n\n\n\n \nKieran Trippier, making his Tottenham debut after his summer arrival from relegated Burnley, had started brightly but was caught square by Ansi Agolli and tripped the left-back to concede a penalty that was duly dispatched by Almeida to give Qarabag an unexpected lead. \n\nThe visitors were having the better of the opening exchanges as Tottenham could not settle, with Son flashing a shot well wide when given a rare sight of goal. \n\nBut the South Korea international levelled the game on 28 minutes as he turned home Andros Townend's low corner unmarked from inside the six-yard box. \n\nHis second followed just three minutes later as Dele Alli danced into the box before squaring for the ex-Bayer Leverkusen man to fire past Sehic and turn the match on its head. \n\n\t\t\t \nAlli should have had his own goal but could not beat Sehic after being played in behind by Townsend, and soon after Toby Alderweireld headed over Trippier's deep cross. \n\nThe visitors were still a threat going forward and Danny Rose was lucky to get away with a chested backpass that was intercepted by Afran Ismayilov, who could only shoot wide after latching on to the loose ball. \n\nReynaldo was next to come close to an equaliser as the striker met Javid Taghiyev's pinpoint cross with a header that flashed over Hugo Lloris' crossbar. \n\nLamela came close at the start of the second half as he hit the post after running onto Alli's through ball before Son attempted a deft finish when he could have easily completed his hat-trick. \n\n\t\t\t \nQarabag had settled for hitting Tottenham on the break and, after Spurs debutant Kevin Wimmer had dallied when attempting a clearance, Dani Quintana flashed a shot just wide. \n\nSon came off to a rousing ovation with just over 20 minutes remaining as Kane replaced him, with Clinton Njie coming on for his Spurs bow in place of Townsend, but it was Quintana who again came close as his header forced Lloris into action. \n\nLamela then killed the game off , chipping home after Kane had chased back and won the ball back from Rashad Sadygov before feeding the Argentinian forward. \n\nAlli could not top a fine personal display with a goal as he saw a late shot dribble past the post but Spurs saw out stoppage time to open their Group J campaign with all three points. \n\nTWEET OF THE MATCH \n\n\t\t\t \n"This young Spurs team is full of baby face players. The team sponsor should be Mothercare." - Tottenham fan @Lord_Sugar has a new business idea. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lord_Sugar/status/644604453421776896 \n\nPLAYER RATINGS \n\nTottenham: \n\nHugo Lloris: 6/10 \n\nKieran Trippier: 6 \n\nKevin Wimmer: 7 \n\nToby Alderweireld: 6 \n\nDanny Rose: 5 \n\nEric Dier: 6 \n\nTom Carroll: 6 \n\nDele Alli: 8 \n\nErik Lamela: 6 \n\nAndros Townsend: 6 \n\nSong Heung-min: 8 \n\nSubs: \n\nHarry Kane: 6 \n\nClinton Njie: 5 \n\nHarry Winks: 6 \n\nSTAR PLAYER \n\nDele Alli: Son may have stolen the show with two goals on his home debut but former MK Dons midfielder Alli ran the show on his first appearance in European football. The 19-year-old provided a superb assist for the second goal and was constantly a thorn in the side of the Qarabag defence. Should have had his own goal when played through in the first-half but other than that he was on top form. \n\nMOMENT OF THE MATCH \n\nSon Heung-min: The South Korean scored a well-taken second goal just moments after opening his Tottenham account with a tap-in. He finished coolly having been played in by Alli and showed that he has the ability to provide plenty of goals for the White Hart Lane faithful to savour. \n\nVIEW FROM THE BENCH \n\nPochettino would have been upset with his side's start to the game but, with Kane struggling for goals and rested tonight, the Argentinian would have been delighted that summer recruit Son was able to show his promise. Trippier, Wimmer and Njie all made their competitive debuts and, with Mousa Dembele, Christian Eriksen and Ryan Mason to return from injury, Pochettino has a strong squad to push on for success this season. \n\nMOAN OF THE MATCH \n\nA distinct lack of atmosphere seems to haunt this competition and the draw of playing the champions of Azerbaijan could not attract a bumper crowd at White Hart Lane. The majority of those in attendance were quiet for much of the contest. A long run in the tournament may change that but for now these sorts of evenings are here to stay. \n\nWHO'S UP NEXT \n\nTottenham v Crystal Palace (Premier League, Sunday September 20). \n\nMidfielder Dele Alli expected a workout against the Azerbaijan champions but was happy with Spurs' overall performance. \n\n"I think it was unfortunate to give away the first goal but overall it was a good performance," he told BT Sport Europe. \n\n"They definitely weren't going to come here and play down. They made us work for the win as we knew they would and they're not a bad side. They came here with a point to prove and I think they did well." \n\nThe playmaker also hailed double goalscorer Son after the South Korean changed the course of the game in two first-half minutes. \n\n"It's always good to help the team and I'm obviously happy for Son getting his two goals and it was good to play a part in it and I'm happy with the win," Alli said. \n\n"He's a top player and it's always good to have competition with a few players that can play up front. He put in a good performance and I'm delighted for him getting his two goals." \n\n\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved

And I had a massive erection that would not go away," he told The Sun. \n \nMedforth spent 36 hours in hospital in August and said that staff and paramedics who attended him saw the funny side of his painful predicament. \n \n"The paramedics were very professional but you could see they were trying not to laugh. The doctors and nurses told me off," he said. \n \nAfter being sent home, Medforth was forced to spend several days in bed as the erections continued. \n \n"It wasn't a permanent erection but every time I brushed against something for five days it sprang into life and it was no use to me," he told The Sun. \n \n'Fortunately my wife has forgiven me and I realise I have been very, very lucky.' \n    \n- Stuff

0478_0b63f656-e166-4c0f-adeb-6e251522eeee	Devo Co-Founder Serves Guests 9/11-Themed Wedding Cake, Box Cutters by Jen Chung in News\ton Sep 14, 2015 12:10 pm Via TMZ.com Devo co-founder Jerry Casale got married last week on September 11th, and for some reason the happy couple decided it was a fantastic idea to make the deadliest terrorist attack in American history their wedding theme. Festive! We're guessing they registered for this 9/11 cheese plate too. Someone sent TMZ photos and details about Casale and Krista Napp's event:Jerry Casale -- Devo's singer and bassist -- married Krista Napp on Friday at Michael's Restaurant in Santa Monica.

0484_e6ecc3db-420f-4a2f-8ef1-76e8e94d2390	MUMBAI: Indrani Mukerjea, key accused in the sensational Sheena Bora murder case, has "confessed" to her role in the crime, while her husband, ex-Star India CEO Peter Mukerjea, underwent another round of marathon grilling today even as police tries to crack the intriguing case. \n\nIndrani has "confessed" to her role in the crime, a senior police officer said without providing further details. \n\nSince her arrest late last month, Indrani had been maintaining that Sheena was very much alive and living in US. The grilling of Peter in the case continued and he was confronted with Indrani and the two other accused. The media baron, who reached Khar Police Station at 11.30 am, was being questioned till late in the evening, police said. \n\nBesides his wife, Peter was brought face-to-face with Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani's former husband and her driver Shyam Rai, both of whom have been arrested, police said. \n\nToday's interrogation is being supervised by a DCP level officer. Peter was questioned for nearly 12 hours yesterday and the questioning went on till late night. Indrani was brought to the police station two hours after her husband arrived. \n\n"(Peter) Mukerjea was called again at the Khar Police Station as we are trying to corroborate his statement with that of Indrani, with whom he co-founded INX Media," the officer said. \n\nMeanwhile, the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina here has begun the process of analysing the samples of Indrani and skeletal remains found in adjoining Raigad district to match the DNA and determine if the body was that of Sheena. \n\nYesterday, police carried out a search at Peter's flat in Worli and took away some documents and a laptop. The same set of questions given to Peter was also handed over to Indrani, who was brought in from the Bandra Police lock-up and made to sit in an adjoining room. \n\nSome of the questions posed to Peter pertained to his financial transactions, especially his investments, his share in various companies and how much money he had given to Indrani, son Rahul, step-daughter Sheena and younger step- daughter Vidhie, who is Indrani's daughter from her previous marriage.
0485_764c3781-4b20-4344-9a89-cdfecf9f302c	FOUNDERS CORNER: MAJOR WORKS Wednesday, July 16, Saturday, July 26, Saturday, August 9, 1788 Certain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution Considered and Answered to including a fascinating discussion on a proposed Bill of Rights. IN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken notice of, and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it. There, however, remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their proper places. These shall now be discussed; but as the subject has been drawn into great length, I shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper. The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other answers given to this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the States are in a similar predicament. I add that New York is of the number. And yet the opposers of the new system, in this State, who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights. To justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things: one is that, though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to the same thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts, in their full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by which many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured. To the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the convention contains, as well as the constitution of this State, a number of such provisions. Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, we find the following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7 — “Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.” Section 9, of the same article, clause 2 — “The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.” Clause 3 — “No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed.” Clause 7 — “No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.” Article 3, section 2, clause 3 — “The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.” Section 3, of the same article — “Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.” And clause 3, of the same section — “The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.” It may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this State. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone,1 in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: “To bereave a man of life, [says he] or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.” And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place he calls “the BULWARK of the British Constitution.”2 Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people. To the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the Constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made subject “to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.” They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course have no constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the Revolution. This consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself. It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. Such was the Petition of Right assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his reign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights. It is evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification, they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. “WE, THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” Here is a better recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our State bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government. But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a Constitution like that under consideration, which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud clamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this State. But the truth is, that both of them contain all which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired. I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights. On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever has been said about it in that of any other State, amounts to nothing. What signifies a declaration, that “the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved”? What is the liberty of the press? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the government.3 And here, after all, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights. There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in Great Britain form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution of each State is its bill of rights. And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the Union. Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of the government? This is done in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention; comprehending various precautions for the public security, which are not to be found in any of the State constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are relative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has also been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan. Adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though it will not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing. It certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the government. And hence it must be apparent, that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely foreign from the substance of the thing. Another objection which has been made, and which, from the frequency of its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is of this nature: “It is improper [say the objectors] to confer such large powers, as are proposed, upon the national government, because the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the conduct of the representative body.” This argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever. For the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be vested in the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite control. But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well founded. There is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the imagination. What are the sources of information by which the people in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the State legislature? Of personal observation they can have no benefit. This is confined to the citizens on the spot. They must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men, in whom they confide; and how must these men obtain their information? Evidently from the complexion of public measures, from the public prints, from correspondences with theirrepresentatives, and with other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations. This does not apply to Montgomery County only, but to all the counties at any considerable distance from the seat of government. It is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government, and the impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create, will be overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State governments. The executive and legislative bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every department of the national administration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the national councils, and can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people. Their disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rivalship of power. And we may conclude with the fullest assurance that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their national representatives, than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their State representatives. It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will, in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with those who are at a distance, and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project. The public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the Union. Among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to the United States. This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters. The newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made upon the subject in another place, I shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law, that “States neither lose any of their rights, nor are discharged from any of their obligations, by a change in the form of their civil government.”4 The last objection of any consequence, which I at present recollect, turns upon the article of expense. If it were even true, that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan. The great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced, that Union is the basis of their political happiness. Men of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preserved under the present system, nor without radical alterations; that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that these require a different organization of the federal government — a single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. In conceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it is impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand. The two branches of the legislature are, in the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is the same number of which Congress, under the existing Confederation, may be composed. It is true that this number is intended to be increased; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of the country. It is evident that a less number would, even in the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the present number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a very inadequate representation of the people. Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? One source indicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government. Let us examine this a little. It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government, are the same which will be required under the new. There are now a Secretary of War, a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a Board of Treasury, consisting of three persons, a Treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc. These officers are indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well as the old. As to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries, the proposed Constitution can make no other difference than to render their characters, where they reside, more respectable, and their services more useful. As to persons to be employed in the collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public expense. It will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of State for national officers. In the collection of all duties, for instance, the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description. The States individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose. What difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the State or by the United States? There is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former. Where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented to us? The chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the judges of the United States. I do not add the President, because there is now a president of Congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any thing, short of those which will be incurred on account of the President of the United States. The support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter. But upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence. Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government. The first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the President. Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the Senate, and subject to their final concurrence. Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the Senate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future Congress. But there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy. The business of the United States has hitherto occupied the State legislatures, as well as Congress. The latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the States. More than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now the members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount to two thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that number. The Congress under the proposed government will do all the business of the United States themselves, without the intervention of the State legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular States, and will not have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference in the time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain, and will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system. The result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union. PUBLIUS 1. Vide Blackstone’s Commentaries, Vol. 1, p. 136. 2. Idem, Vol. 4, p. 438. 3. To show that there is a power in the Constitution by which the liberty of the press may be affected, recourse has been had to the power of taxation. It is said that duties may be laid upon the publications so high as to amount to a prohibition. I know not by what logic it could be maintained, that the declarations in the State constitutions, in favor of the freedom of the press, would be a constitutional impediment to the imposition of duties upon publications by the State legislatures. It cannot certainly be pretended that any degree of duties, however low, would be an abridgment of the liberty of the press. We know that newspapers are taxed in Great Britain, and yet it is notorious that the press nowhere enjoys greater liberty than in that country. And if duties of any kind may be laid without a violation of that liberty, it is evident that the extent must depend on legislative discretion, respecting the liberty of the press, will give it no greater security than it will have without them. The same invasions of it may be effected under the State constitutions which contain those declarations through the means of taxation, as under the proposed Constitution, which has nothing of the kind. It would be quite as significant to declare that government ought to be free, that taxes ought not to be excessive, etc., as that the liberty of the press ought not to be restrained. 4.

0486_0f49a710-ea5c-46ae-8401-8755cd1de2a5	You may have seen that ridiculous campaign the other week. The one with a baby breastfeeding on a burger. It made me feel a bit cross. And then want to go out and get a burger. Jokes aside though, this is just another thing for vulnerable new mums to worry about. Why can't we stop scaremongering new mums and focus on supporting them instead? \n\nBreast vs. bottle vs. coke? \n\nSo apparently the debate is no longer just breast vs. bottle. It's now breast vs. bottle vs. coke. \n\nThis campaign to get mums to eat healthily may only be in Brazil. For now. But the wonders of social networking mean that far more have seen it. And a high proportion of these are vulnerable new mums. Sat at home on their sofa. Nursing their babies. Having trouble nursing their babies. Wondering when the endless days of having a baby attached to their boob are ever going to end. \n\nHow is it helpful to then be told that what they are giving their baby from their own body might be harming their baby? That what they are giving them is the equivalent of a burger or a can of coke. \n\nI mean, come on. Really? \n\nPreying on the vulnerable. \n\nAs a (semi) rational human being of a now 14 month old, I can see that this campaign is silly. \n\nBut the problem is new mums are not rational. I know this first hand. Three times over. They're sleep deprived. They're hormonal and emotional. They're already questioning so much and thinking that they're doing EVERYTHING wrong. Then they see a picture like this and are wracked with yet more guilt. 'Am I really harming my baby?' they think. 'When on earth am I going to find time to make myself something healthy? Arggghhhhhh!' \n\nCue more pressure and angst that new mums just don't need. \n\nThe reality is a galaxy far, far away from your five-a-day. \n\nBreastfeeding is time consuming. \n\nIn the early weeks you literally do nothing but nurse your baby. Beyond this, some babies are fussy and might struggle to get into a feeding routine. They seem to nurse ALL DAY LONG. \n\nSo when, exactly, are new mums expected to look after their own nutrition? When are they supposed to make a healthy meal or think about eating their five-a-day? The reality is, it's often far easier to reach for a slab of cake or a couple of chocolate digestives. \n\nJust to tied the hunger over. \n\nHave your cake and eat it. \n\nWith my first baby, I tried to get into good habits. \n\nWhen Daddy Pig was on paternity leave, I would have a two litre bottle of water by my side at all times. And a bowl of unsalted cashew nuts and dried apricots. \n\nThis lasted for about as long as his paternity leave. Two weeks. \n\nThen he went back to work. And I hit the cake. HARD. \n\nThree kids in and I haven't looked back. \n\nDitch the guilt. Now. \n\nSo, forget it, new mums. Forget it. \n\nYou are NOT giving your baby Coca Cola. (And if you are, then I've given my kids a lot worse. Believe me. Which, actually, might explain a lot.) \n\nPlus I have it on good advice (from a midwife who oversaw my friend's triplet pregnancy) that if the only thing you can eat is a burger, there is nutrition and, more importantly, calories in this. Breastfeeding mums need calories. FACT. \n\nI'm not advocating you don't try and eat some of your five-a-day (bananas or an apple are easy to grab on the run). I'm just saying NOW is not the time to overhaul your diet or become neurotic about consuming pomegranate seeds and seaweed. You've got enough going on. Cut yourself some slack. \n\nAnd, whilst you're at it, a big piece of cake. \n\nA less bitter pill to swallow. \n\nIf you are concerned about what you're eating (or what you're not eating), there are other ways, simpler ways to help yourself along a bit during this challenging period (because it does get easier, it does). \n\nLike taking a multivitamin. Under the Healthy Start scheme, pregnant women, women with babies under a year and children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins. Take-up is being encouraged (this is not the same as getting free Calpol on the NHS). Just pop into your local pharmacy and ask if they're participating (many are and can register you there and then). \n\nQuick and easy. Just what new mums need, right? \n\nNew mum superfood salad. \n\nIf you do, by some miracle, find yourself with a moment or, better still, a helpful friend or relative, get some of this down you. \n\nAn easy, peasy, tasty salad packed full of good stuff, that I pretty much live on (when I'm not gorging on burgers, obviously). \n\nBecause unlike lots of salads, it isn't bland. It tastes blooming good. And it takes less than 5 minutes to prepare (once you've roasted the potato. But if you buy a biggish sweet potato and a couple of avocados, this will easily last you four lunches). Serve it with a pitta bread for a bit more bulk. \n\nWhy not alternate it with the burgers and coke? Ha ha. \n\nAlso? It's the perfect entree to a BIG slab of cake. \n\n(Which you totally, totally deserve. Because you're doing great.) \n\nAmy blogs at Surviving Life and Motherhood . You can also find her on
0487_9e026813-bd29-47c8-a5b6-4f1ea1ff6fc2	Everyone has their own take on these debates, and as often as not they are wrong, but here we are.  My chief takeaway from tonight was that it was a disaster for Jeb Bush and a poor showing by John Kasich. \n \nLook, I like Jeb. I think he’s obviously qualified to be President, he’s got a deep grasp of the issues, he has assets that might matter in a general election, he’s more conservative than people think, and he seems like a really nice guy and a steady, adult presence.  I could happily vote for him as our nominee.  But despite some good moments that showed him as a thoughtful and judicious presence, this was an awful showing.  His back and forths with Donald Trump left him looking, as Tim Pawlenty once did next to Mitt Romney, and as Mike Dukakis did in 1988, like he was just not the alpha dog in the room.  He couldn’t seem to muster genuine anger even when he accused Trump of criticizing his wife.  His own wife!  He let Trump cut him off, which may be the polite move but given the dynamics between the two was something he could not do, and which his brother would never have let happen in that situation.  He referred to his own father and brother as “41” and “43”.  And he sounded legitimately unaware of why people are upset at Chief Justice Roberts.  Jeb would be an excellent candidate in a different environment and a fine president, but after tonight, it’s hard to see him as a winner. \n \nAnd Kasich sounded way too John Kerry, with his insistence on yammering about America’s alliances, while not scoring the sorts of “I’m a different kind of Republican” points he needs to win New Hampshire.  He sounded out of date talking about the 90s, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)  100% absolutely crushed him in an exchange about the Iran deal, which Kasich inexplicably refuses to renounce. \n \nDonald Trump was, surprisingly, less of a factor in this debate as it went along – the more it got into policy, the worse it was for him (although he gets some points for being the first to raise North Korea as an issue).  Trump looked small, red and angry next to Jeb (their exchanges really did favors for neither) and came out terribly every time he tangled with Carly Fiorina.  I won’t pretend to believe this kills Trump, he still had his moments of Trumpitude, but his act felt just a bit older than last time around.  He brooded on potshots from George Pataki (!) and threw needless insults at Rand Paul.  Probably the ugliest part of Trump’s performance was sounding like RFK Jr. on vaccines.  Maybe the perfect Trump moment, even more than when he responded to Hugh Hewitt asking about his advisers by just saying they would be terrific people, was in the middle of his rambling defense of his Atlantic City casinos when he threw in as an aside at Christie, “maybe I’ll blame Chris.”  It was a vintage “you, Lieutenant Weinberg?” moment. \n \nThe winners?  Chris Christie had another excellent performance, running as an unabashed 2002 Republican, but I’m still not so sure that there are enough persuadable Christie voters out there to matter.  Rubio also always fares well in these settings, and the more of them there are, the more he should prosper – but his fundamental challenges lie in convincing people that he’s more than just a good talker.  Carly Fiorina had probably more fantastic moments onstage than anyone (although Christie squelched her defense of her HP tenure), and probably comes out of this with the biggest poll bounce. \n \nI underrated Ben Carson after the last debate, where he just sounded over his head but people warmed to his humility and earnest likeability.  He was a little more in command tonight, and has a disarming way of making people feel bad about the fact that he’s not really comfortable in the debate format.  I suspect Carson may have a reckoning coming, but that he’s probably still ascending after tonight. \n \nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)  100% and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)  87% were who they always are, although Cruz uncharacteristically got baited by Jeb into admitting he’d been wrong to praise Roberts, and Paul sounded hoarse and ended up more or less arguing that Saddam Hussein had been good for the Middle East.  (He also claimed that Reagan talked to our enemies throughout the Cold War, a common Obama talking point.  But Reagan never met with Brezhnev, Andropov, or Chernenko – his first summit with the Soviets was with Gorbachev in November 1985, a year after he was re-elected to a second term ).  The Paul-Jeb-Christie-Carly exchange on drugs was one of the debate’s most serious, thoughtful moments.  Mike Huckabee remains good in small doses – every now and then he brought up something that needed saying, like Obama’s manipulation of intelligence – but he really has no business on the stage at this point in his career. \n \nThe really interesting question to me, going into tonight, was how Scott Walker would do, since he’s never really had to run from behind like this, but while he was a bit more aggressive, he basically stayed within himself.  Walker suffered badly, as almost all the candidates besides Jeb did, from long lapses between questions. \n \nIt’s a long road ahead, and most of the candidates still have many ups and down ahead.  But I can’t imagine any camp is unhappier tonight than Jeb’s. \n \nThe post This Was Not A Good Debate For Jeb Bush and John Kasich appeared first on RedState .

(Photo: Photo by Chris Burkard) \n\nChristian rock band Switchfoot and musician Jeremy Camp will host A Night of Rock & Worship at 7 p.m. Thursday at First Arena in Elmira. \n\nAfter gaining a foothold in the contemporary Christian music scene, Switchfoot went mainstream with 2003’s “The Beautiful Letdown,” a double-platinum album that straddled the line between sacred and secular rock music. It spawned the hits “Meant to Live” and “Dare You to Move.” 2005’s “Nothing Is Sound” debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and went gold, sparking another radio hit in “Stars.” \n\nIn recent years, the band’s album “Hello Hurricane won the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album, followed by “Vice Verses” and 2014’s “Fading West,” which stretched beyond the typical constraints of the three-minute pop song, experimenting with unusual instruments and musical textures. \n\nJeremy Camp is not only a musician but an ordained minister.   (Photo: Provided) \n\nCamp, an ordained minister, recently released his eighth studio album, “I Will Follow.” The first single off the new record, “He Knows,” discusses the comfort he says he received from God in troubling times: He lost his first wife to cancer at age 21, and in recent years he lost a baby to miscarriage with his wife, Adrienne. \n\nTickets for Thursday’s performance are $55 for reserved floor seating or $25 for general admission; purchase online at firstarena.com.

0489_91bbe44c-c4bf-4fae-8fe6-175ce7043a64	In America’s swing state, aging voting machines and partisan battles are casting doubt over the fairness of the 2016 election. Immediately after the 2004 election, when tens of thousands of Ohioans waited hours to vote, the state enacted a series of reforms that began to address the worst of that year’s nightmares. But now much of that progress is in danger of being undone. Politicians and advocates are waging similar battles across the country, but the stakes may be highest here, in perhaps the most important of swing states on the national electoral map. With voting laws in flux and funding for better voting technology a constant struggle nationwide, two central questions remain just 14 months before Election Day: who will be able to vote, and will all their votes be counted accurately?\nIn 2005, Ohio passed a sweeping bill that expanded early and absentee voting, and a series of legal settlements in the following years helped put in place some of the nation’s best electoral practices. But over the past few years, Republicans have been chipping away at many of those changes. GOP leaders say they’re simply trying to guarantee uniformity and prevent voter fraud, but voting rights advocacy groups say the recent changes threaten to bring back problems from the past, and may be driven by an effort to suppress voter turnout.\nMeanwhile, Ohio leaders are largely ignoring what a bipartisan federal panel called an “impending crisis:” voting equipment that’s at least a decade old and in need of replacement. Ohio Secretary of State, Jon Husted, sounded the alarm two years ago in testimony before President Obama’s bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration. “The next time we go to the polls to elect a president, these machines will be 12 years old,” he said. “That's a lifetime when it comes to technology.”\nYet his office has failed to forward any plan to replace the equipment, leaving cash-strapped counties to devise their own solutions. In the rolling farmland of Ohio’s Amish Country, for example, the Holmes County Board of Elections is strategically pinching pennies, holding off purchases of printers and other items, in hopes the county can scrounge together a few hundred thousand dollars to replace its aging voting equipment. And Holmes is actually one of the few counties that have any plan.\nThis crisis has its roots in the solution to a previous problem. The 2002 Help America Vote Act provided more than $3 billion to help states purchase new equipment, and the majority of local jurisdictions bought replacements over the next few years, mostly either touch-screen devices or optical scan machines that record votes from a paper ballot. The result is that, with rare exceptions, the country’s voting machines are all aging out at the same time.\nFrom Cleveland to Cincinnati, Toledo to Dayton, the stories are similar. Most of the state’s 88 counties share these election-related dilemmas. Considering that no presidential candidate has won since 1960 without winning Ohio, these struggles over the fine details of the voting process may go a long way toward determining the outcome of next November’s presidential election.\nIn the ensuing years, the ills of the nation’s voting system drew increasing scrutiny from the political parties, advocacy groups and academics, with the clearest symptom of those ills being lines at the polls. While most people do not wait long to vote, lines have persisted in some locales, leading to the loss of some 500,000 to 700,000 votes in 2012, according to an analysis by Charles Stewart III, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stephen Ansolabehere, of Harvard University. Voters in Florida waited an average of about 40 minutes that year, the longest in the nation.\nThose lines prompted Barack Obama in 2013 to appoint the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, which held a series of hearings and pulled together relevant research to create a list of best practices. The commission noted that many issues, a dearth of data, uneven resource allocation, poorly maintained registration rolls, were rooted in the system’s decentralization, and it published a lengthy list of recommendations, including allowing people to register to vote online and expanding early voting opportunities. But perhaps nothing the commission said was more unsettling than the “impending crisis” it identified with the nation’s aging voting infrastructure.\nIn 2014, a review by Virginia’s Department of Elections of that state’s equipment, which includes the AccuVote, found that over time, a coating in the machine’s touch screen degrades a glue that holds the screen’s layers together, causing calibration errors that can prompt voters to select the wrong candidate. Ohio also has this problem and has been forced to send a handful of the devices back to Election Systems & Software, which in 2009 purchased the original manufacturer, a subsidiary of Diebold. AccuVote is the most commonly used machine in Ohio, according to a survey conducted by the Ohio Association of Election Officials, with at least 33 counties deploying them each election.\nAll but four of Ohio’s 88 counties are using machines bought in 2006 or earlier, and according to the association survey, only 14 counties have a plan to replace them. The stakes are even higher in Franklin County, where 4,700 iVotronic touch-screen machines sit in a hangar-like space in the back of the Board of Elections’ sprawling offices on the north side of Columbus. Those machines, which were first used in 2006, serve some 800,000 voters and are aging fast, but there is no plan to replace them, says William A. Anthony Jr., the county’s elections director. A Center for Public Integrity review of Franklin County records showed that poll workers reported at least 105 incidents with voting equipment on Election Day 2014, though some of those incidents involved multiple machines. States are responsible for purchasing and maintaining their own equipment, and in many cases they delegate the task to the nation’s 8,000 local jurisdictions. While there’s no good data on machine failures, incidents have been popping up all over the country. On Election Day 2014, for example, voting machines in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, started crashing and became inoperable. The state Department of Elections ordered a review that found the machines were highly vulnerable to attacks that could alter vote tallies without detection. The review determined that a hacker could access the machine, called a WinVote, using a USB port or a wireless device, the Wi-Fi password was “abcde”. The machines’ software, a version of Windows from 2002, was easy to hack, as was its database, which was protected by a password that the reviewers cracked in 10 seconds. The Election Day problems, however, appeared to have originated when a poll worker who used a smartphone to stream music through the Wi-Fi of the library where voting was taking place. The report prompted the state to decertify the machines immediately. Virginia was the only state still using them, forcing 30 localities to scramble to find replacements.\nIn December, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe had proposed spending $28 million on new voting equipment, but the legislature stripped the funding from the budget this year, two months before the WinVote report was published. Despite the lack of funding, all 30 jurisdictions are replacing their equipment, said Edgardo Cortes, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections, either by purchasing or leasing new systems or, in a couple of cases, receiving used machines from other localities.\nSome states have upgraded their machines in recent years, including New Mexico and Maryland. But they are the exception to the rule. This year, the Arkansas legislature passed a bill authorizing $30 million to buy new machines but then failed to actually provide the money. Secretary of State Mark Martin had been pushing to replace the state’s voting equipment, going so far as to choose a vendor. But the legislature’s failure to act forced Martin to scale back the initial plan to a $2.5 million pilot project in four counties.\nThe Brennan Center for Justice, which works to expand access to voting and has been canvassing state officials for an upcoming report about voting equipment, found that while a “substantial majority” of states plan to replace their equipment within five years, officials in most of those states said they do not know where they’ll get the cash. “These aren’t small amounts of money,” Lawrence Norden, who is leading the Brennan Center’s work, says by email. “Given the numbers of machines that need to be replaced, we’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.”\nOhio had one of the highest rates of provisional votes cast in the last presidential election, when they comprised 3.7 percent of all ballots, and also one of the highest rates of rejected provisional ballots, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. While most were rejected because the voter wasn’t registered, officials tossed more than 9,000 because the voter cast the ballot at the wrong polling location, and nearly 3,000 because the voter failed to sign or print their name on the ballot envelope.\nOhio’s laws may yet change again before the next presidential election. Just weeks after the settlement that established the 28-day early voting compromise in April, groups represented by the general counsel of Hillary Clinton’s campaign filed a federal lawsuit challenging a broad slate of the state’s measures. In August, the Ohio Democratic Party and two groups representing the homeless filed an updated complaint arguing that the 2014 laws on absentee and provisional ballot rules discriminate against minority voters. This is the latest step in a federal suit dating back to 2006 that, in 2010, resulted in a consent decree that has helped determine how the state counts provisional ballots.\nEven if the Clinton lawyer’s case in Ohio is dismissed or unsuccessful, the state’s early voting laws may change again soon anyway. The April settlement on early voting expires after 2018.\nThe same uncertainty hangs over what types of machines voters will use in 2016 and beyond, says Norden, of the Brennan Center. There’s a “stalemate now between different branches and levels of government as to who’s responsible for paying for this,” he says.\nIn an effort to reduce spending, county election boards eliminated more than 700 voting precincts from 2010 to 2013 in Ohio, a seven percent cut. The state sets a maximum number of voters per precinct, and sometimes the consolidations have few if any negative effects. But in several instances they’ve caused problems.\nSummit County cut more than a third of its 475 precincts before the 2012 election. When voters went to the polls in Akron that year, some waited more than two hours when locations didn’t have enough voting booths to accommodate demand, and the county reversed many of the cuts the next year.\nEven the state funding for electronic pollbooks, $12.8 million, has been framed as much in terms of cutting costs as anything else. Counties will no longer have to pay to print extensive paper lists for each polling location and will be able to save time and money due to the comparative ease of updating digital records.\nNYC Wins When Everyone Can Vote!

0491_201757bd-d2e7-45b0-ba45-6beb6c3f20fc	Katinka Blackford Newman, 47, was prescribed antidepressants Quickly became psychotic, believing she had killed her children on live TV Spent the year in a near-catatonic state taking a cascade of powerful drugs She only recovered when she stopped taking all medication   \nDivorce is never easy, but when Katinka Blackford Newman separated from her lawyer husband in January 2012, after 13 years of marriage, friends couldn't believe how well she coped. 'I got fit and I started dating,' she says. \n\nA successful film-maker with a raft of award-winning documentaries behind her, including Locked Up Abroad, Katinka was, she says, 'on top of my game'. \n\n'I'd always juggled my career with running a household,' she explains. 'I thought nothing of directing crews of 50, yet always found time to attend school functions and throw dinner parties.' \n   \nKatinka Blackford Newman, 47, with daughter Lily, 14, right, and her son Oscar, 12, left \n\nBut nine months after she and her husband separated, she was faced with an emotional crisis she couldn't solve - the sale of the family home. \n\n'I felt I'd let the kids down - Oscar was then ten and Lily 11 - and I was crippled by fear of the unknown,' she says. \n\nSuffering from sleepless nights, and waking in pools of sweat - at 47 she was beginning to suffer from hot flushes associated with the menopause - she made an appointment with a private psychiatrist, who concluded she was suffering from depression. 'The world I had built was crumbling - but looking back, I don't think I was ever depressed,' she says. \n \nNonetheless, the psychiatrist prescribed an antidepressant, escitalopram, one of a group of widely prescribed drugs called SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which effectively boost levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain. \n\nHours after taking the first dose, Katinka felt restless and agitated, as if she needed to be in constant motion. She didn't sleep that night and, by the following day, wasn't making any sense. \n\n'I had this overwhelming feeling of doom,' she says. 'I thought I was living inside a video game - at one point I was 100 per cent certain I'd killed the children - and I'd been filmed killing them for national TV. I thought the police were outside waiting for me.' \n\nIn fact, Katinka had taken a kitchen knife and lacerated the whole of her left arm. 'I was in hell,' she says. 'It was terrifying.' \n   \nKatinka was prescribed a cascade of powerful drugs to treat her symptoms \n\nFrightened, the children called their aunt and uncle. As Katinka had private health insurance, her sister drove her to a leading private hospital in London, where she was sedated. \n\nKatinka was diagnosed with psychotic depression and started on an anti-psychotic drug, risperidone, and another antidepressant, mirtazapine, which immediately made her feel lethargic, spaced out and very anxious. \n\n'I dribbled and I was monosyllabic,' she says. 'There also were numerous "talking therapy" sessions, but I couldn't sit still to listen. I didn't react when the children came to see me. I didn't care about anything - and it got much, much worse.' \n\nKatinka was in hospital for three weeks, where she was prescribed a cascade of powerful drugs to treat her symptoms. As her mood worsened, her psychiatrist prescribed two more drugs - olanzapine, an antipsychotic, sertraline, an antidepressant, and switched the risperidone for fluoxetine (better known by brand name Prozac). \n\nKatinka spent the next year in a near-catatonic state, in and out of hospital, or needing to be cared for at home. \n\nIt's difficult to reconcile her story with the neat, articulate woman sitting on the sofa as we talk. She's super-fit, and her North London home is beautifully decorated. Lily and Oscar bang about upstairs and she occasionally calls up to ask them to keep the noise down. But during her 'lost year' she became, she says, 'a stranger to everyone who loved me'. \n 'I felt no emotion at all,' she says. 'Oscar later said that for a whole year I didn't cry or laugh. He said: "Mummy, if a unicorn had come into the room, you wouldn't have noticed."  \n'I've always been the sort of person who takes on too much,' she explains. 'But taking antidepressants turned me into a zombie who needed a 24-hour carer. I gained 3st and for nine of those 12 months I couldn't wash or dress myself properly or even finish a sentence.' \n\nAccording to the NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre, 57.1 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written last year, almost double the number in 2004. But depression is a multi-layered disorder and while these drugs appear to help some people, scientists have only a hazy idea about how they work. \n\nSome now question whether they work at all, as Good Health reported last week. And there are also concerns about their side-effects. Katinka is convinced it was the drugs she was prescribed - or rather their side-effects - that caused her symptoms, effectively stealing a year of her life. \n\nOne of the side-effects of olanzapine is insatiable hunger. Whippet-thin - she's normally a size 6 - Katinka was the kind of mother who wouldn't have sweets in the house. 'But I started buying two or three bags of popcorn and three bags of Liquorice Allsorts and eating the lot,' she says. \n\nShe was unable to care for herself, so her supportive ex-husband paid for a 24-hour-carer who helped to wash and dress her. \n\n'I felt no emotion at all,' she says. 'Oscar later said that for a whole year I didn't cry or laugh. He said: "Mummy, if a unicorn had come into the room, you wouldn't have noticed." \n\n'But I was being treated at an expensive private hospital and my family thought: "Surely they know what they're doing?"' \n   \nKatinka feels lucky she has suffered no lasting side-effects and has become a passionate campaigner against SSRIs \n\nSo should Katinka ever have been prescribed antidepressants? \n\nSince 2004, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended talking therapies rather than drugs for mild to moderate depression. \n\nBut prescriptions for antidepressants have soared, with a staggering one in 11 adults in Britain estimated to be taking them - and a recent U.S. study found 69 per cent of those taking these pills may not actually be suffering from depression. \n\nIn spring 2013, Katinka booked herself back into the private hospital, where she was prescribed the powerful mood-stabilising drug lithium, most often used to treat the manic episodes of bipolar disorder. 'People kept asking: "Are you better or worse?" But it was just a morass of awfulness,' she says. 'I felt nothing. I knew that if the children ran in front of a bus, I wouldn't react.' \n\nShe moved into a flat, 'effectively abandoning my children' and began to drink heavily. 'I was going to the supermarket at 2am to buy vodka and Nytol tablets, which I was consuming in dangerous quantities,' she says. \n\n'I was unwashed, unkempt; shuffling round in an old, stained dressing gown, I had giant cuts in my skin where I'd scratched myself in a frenzy of self-mutilation, and I started smoking absurd amounts, sometimes 70 cigarettes a day. \n\n'When my children came to visit, they were so shocked they burst into tears.' \n\nIn September, out of sheer desperation, Katinka took herself to St Charles, an NHS hospital in West London and begged to be admitted. She was sectioned - and, critically, taken off all the drugs she'd been given. 'They wanted to see what worked and what didn't,' she says. \n\nApart from a very low dose of another SSRI, venlafaxine, she went 'cold turkey' - a move she believes saved her life. \n\nThe withdrawal symptoms, which lasted two weeks, were 'indescribably horrendous', she says. 'I was shaking, crying uncontrollably day and night.' But at the same time, miraculously, she could feel herself coming back from the brink. \n\n'My pleasure in things returned as quickly as it had disappeared, literally overnight,' she says. 'It was like coming out of a year-long coma.' \n\nKatinka was in hospital for four weeks - she lost 1½ st and started to organise her life from her hospital bed, even managing to get a job. 'They didn't know I went for the interview from a mental ward...' \n I was unwashed, unkempt; shuffling round in an old, stained dressing gown, I had giant cuts in my skin where I'd scratched myself in a frenzy of self-mutilation, and I started smoking absurd amounts  \nShe rented a house for herself and the children and went home. Two weeks after stopping the by-now very low dose venlafaxine, she was fully herself again. \n\n'I will never forget just the simple enjoyment of being with my children. They lost their mum for a year. Nothing can replace the stories we didn't read, the hugs we didn't share.' \n\nFor Dr David Healy, a professor of psychiatry at Cardiff University, Katinka's experience, although extreme, highlights the dangers of drug side-effects that are too often ignored. A leading critic of SSRIs, he believes they act as no more than a placebo, albeit one with some unpleasant side-effects including nausea, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. \n\nFurthermore, they can actually cause the kind of problems they are meant to help. \n\n'We know that one-fifth of people in clinical trials are more anxious on the drugs than less, and one in 20 drops out of the trial because they become so horribly agitated, they don't want to keep taking them,' he says. \n\nA smaller, but still significant, number of people - he estimates one in 100 - experiences hallucinations or paranoid delusions. \n\nDr Healy created the website RxISK to draw attention to the number of serious adverse 'events' associated with many widely prescribed drugs, including psychiatric pills. He believes there are thousands more patients with stories like Katinka's. 'People don't realise it's the drugs that are causing their symptoms,' he says. \n\nBut this is highly controversial. Professor Allan Young, chair of mood disorders at King's College, London, says: 'SSRIs have been under intense scrutiny for a number of years because of the claims by Dr Healy and others, but there's nothing in the literature to back up the claim SSRIs make suicidal thoughts or psychosis are increased in patients taking these drugs. \n\n'Psychosis does not usually follow treatment with SSRIs,' he says. 'But people who are depressed can become psychotic for a variety of reasons. \n\n'We are worried about the use of antidepressants in bipolar depression, for instance, when not only do they not work, they can cause a switch into mania.' \n\nWhen Katinka came home, Lily and Oscar clung to her as though she'd come back from the dead. Three years later, they seem well-adjusted teenagers, who will only talk reluctantly about the year they lost their mum. \n\n'It was as though someone had stolen Mummy, and I kept thinking if only we could find the switch to switch her back on, but we couldn't,' says Lily, now 14. \n\nKatinka feels lucky she has suffered no lasting side-effects and has become a passionate campaigner against SSRIs. \n\n'We all want to believe in a magic pill. We want to think that if the going gets really tough, there's something that will make us better,' she says. 'But there really isn't - I needed to face my problems and work them out. Having paid the price, I want to tell people it isn't worth taking the risk.' \n\nRxISK.org \n  SALT SWAPS        \nSWAP THIS   \n\n Richmond Thick Pork Sausages: £2.15 for eight; 2.2g salt per two sausages. \n    \nFOR THIS  \n\nSainsbury’s Butcher’s Choice Pork Sausages: £2.55 for 12; 1.57g salt per two sausages. \n   \nAll sausages contain quite a lot of salt to add flavour.

Despite her family being embroiled in a second scandal – following his molestation revelations in May, her cousin Josh admitted to infidelity and pornography addiction and is currently seeking treatment at a faith-based rehab center – Amy was fêted by most of the Duggar clan, who turned out for her big ay. \nRELATED VIDEO: Did Amy Duggar Show Too Much PDA?    \nThe country-chic wedding took place on the grounds of Horton Farms near Bentonville, Arkansas. "We're thinking there will be about 400 people," Amy told PEOPLE ahead of the day – a small gathering by Duggar standards . Says Amy, "These are only our closest friends and family and their families" \n\nThe hundreds of guests included Jim Bob and Michelle, her cousin Jessa and even Josh's embattled wife Anna . "She's been through so much," says Amy, who enlisted Anna and Josh's 5-year-old daughter Mackynzie as one of her flower girls, along with her young Duggar cousins Johanna, Jordyn, Jennifer and Josie. Her cousin Jill also made a stop at the wedding with her family, taking a break from the family's mission work in El Salvador. \n\nThe color theme was rose gold and candlelight and the bride wore a sweetheart neckline gown designed by Essense of Australia.  \n\nThough she was happy to tie the knot surrounded by her loved ones, she's also looking forward to moving on with her life. "I can't wait to change my name", she told PEOPLE earlier in the week. "It's going to be a great day when Dillon signs that marriage license and my last name changes." \n\nStill she says, "My family is so important to me."
0495_b0b150ab-da72-44cc-9d3b-0c957d38df0e	I was gonna work tonight, but TBH I’m so excited by the Mets ridiculous comeback win today that its just not gonna happen.  Instead, I’ve been thinking about sports and fandom and my long history with the New York Mets.\nIt’s always been baseball for me. I’ve never liked football or hockey. There was a brief flirtation with basketball in the late 90s/early 00s, but that was mostly about the narrative surrounding the Knicks, who were like a cadre of Viking warriors – forever doomed to fail in face of Ragnarok, and nevertheless fighting until their last breathes. I see a lot of tennis, mostly because bronwen​ is passionate about it, and I’ve been able to appreciate a lot about the sport. And in the past couple of years I’ve been giving English Soccer a try, and been enjoying it quite a bit (Up Man City!). But I was raised a Mets fan, they were my first and are my only true sports fandom.\nMaybe I’m not a great fan, because I stop watching when they’re bad – and they’ve been bad a lot.  But there have been a few major eras of my fandom with the Mets, each about 15 years apart. And each one has been colored by the different stages of life through which I’ve experienced them.\n1) 1982-1990 \nIn 1982, I was 10 years old. The Mets were terrible, but I didn’t really know that. Whenever I had a chance to go to a game, it was an event. I was just beginning to understand that there were Mets fans and Yankees fans, and it was the life goal of all Yankees fans to make sure that Mets fans knew they were pathetic individuals doomed to a life of squalor and ineptitude.\nTo this day, I hate the Yankees and everything about them. \nBut something funny started happening in 1983 - some really good young players started coming up through the Mets farm system. And there started to be a buzz. In ‘84, they were good. In ‘85, they were better, but not quite good enough. \nIn ‘86, they were legends. \n1986 was the first – and so far only – time my team won it all. I was 14, and the players seemed like gods. We were convinced they’d be unbeatable for years to come. We were wrong.\n\nBy 1990, I’d lived through several disappointing years, watched those young heroes be torn down by drugs, pressure, and the wolverine-voracious New York sports media.\nSeriously, you guys. When it comes to pettiness, entitlement, righteous posturing and ad-hominem attacks, Tumblr has nothing on New York sportswriters.\nIn 1990, I went to college. At some point, I’d figured out that it wasn’t really cool anymore to have posters of baseball players on my walls anymore. It felt…childish. Like I needed to move on to other things. \nIt helped that I went to school in DC, which at the time had no team. And it helped that the early 90s Mets were legendary for how bad they were. It was easy to let them slip back to a peripheral awareness. 1994 was also the strike year, and everybody was fed up with baseball. So it was easily to forget about. Also, I started studying theater. And when you start hanging out with the nerdy, artsy kids, sports are usually not near the top of the conversation.\nAfter college, I went to film school in Greensboro, North Carolina. They had a single-a minor league baseball team called The Bats, and they were in the Yankees farm system, so there was no way in hell I was ever going to set foot in their stadium. Even though they had some young, up-and-coming prospect that everyone was excited about, some kid named Jeter. But when I was in Greensboro, Carolina got a new NFL team, the Panthers, and it was a lot of fun to see a new franchise and new story spring into being. \nIn 1997, I moved back home to New York, and began living in the city. Coincidentally, this happened to dovetail with the next period in which the Mets played decent baseball\nOK, this has gotten much longer than I intended it, so I’m gonna break it up into more than one post.  I wonder how many posts I’ll need to get to whatever point I’m trying to make?

0497_172b66a3-a058-42da-a63c-d694e6005030	SINGAPORE — A 26-year-old man was today (Sept 28) sentenced to two years and nine months’ jail for a series of offences he committed in 2013, including causing the death of his girlfriend when he lost control of his car and crashed into a tree. \n\nThe crash also left Eric Leong Teck Wai wheelchair-bound. He was speeding along Hillview Avenue at about midnight on Oct 22, 2013 when he lost control of his car, causing it to swerve, mount the kerb and collide with a tree. \n  \nLeong’s girlfriend, 23-year-old Cheryl Ng Hui Ling, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at the scene. \n\nThe couple’s friends who had been sitting in the backseat escaped with fractures, despite one of the men being flung out of the car through the broken windscreen. \n\nIn court today, it was revealed that Leong had been driving under the influence of drugs, including phenazepam, a sedative-hypnotic drug not available in Singapore. \n\nSome of the drug’s side effects include impaired balance, slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, and auditory and visual hallucinations. \n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Houston Johannus told the court that Leong had been driving “recklessly, dangerously” at 20km/h over the speed limit, as if he was part of “a chariot racing competition”. The fact that Leong was driving under the influence of drugs is “a highly aggravating factor”. \n\nPointing to Leong’s past convictions for driving without a licence and third-party insurance, DPP Johannus said it was clear that Leong had not learnt his lesson. \n\nIn addressing Leong’s other charges, DPP Johannus again noted that the man had related past convictions. \n\nLeong was also facing one count of theft in dwelling, and another of procuring a teenage student to commit harassment on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender. \n Pages

0499_c797a9c9-563d-4243-b0d4-c214d5798453	New Zealand coach Steve Hansen admitted the lower-ranked nations were catching up following his team's 58-14 World Cup triumph over Namibia on Thursday evening. \n \nThe All Blacks ran out comfortable winners in the Pool C encounter at the Olympic Stadium - but in days gone by would have got closer to 150 points. \n \nNehe Milner-Skudder and Julian Savea scored two tries apiece, with Victor Vito, Malakai Fekitoa, Beauden Barrett, Ben Smith and Codie Taylor also going over. \n \nHowever, the biggest cheer of the night came in the 50th minute when the 'no-hopers' scored a try against the World Cup holders. \n \nWhat a try it was too, the Namibians constantly attacking in one direction before suddenly switching for Johan Deysel to power over for a famous score. \n \nThere was to be no major shock here but an impressive display nonetheless, coupled with Japan's victory over South Africa, signalled the traditional powerhouses were not getting things all their own way any more. \n \nAnd Hansen said: "The scoreboards suggest that's the case. When everyone was talking about record scores here, I said they were foolish. \n \n"World rugby has put in a lot of money and effort to improve standards and the so-called minnows have played well so far." \n \nNamibia counterpart Phil Davies agreed the upturn in performances from the lower-ranked nations was no fluke. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nHe said: "When you look at Japan's victory, they had been building that performance over a couple of years. \n \n"I know the preparation Georgia have put in and we have put a lot of preparation in as well. The effort the players put in has been phenomenal."

Her mother Julia Porter was a former slave. Her father’s name is unknown, but because of Janie Barrett’s fair skin it is believed that he was Caucasian. Barrett’s mother worked as a live-in housekeeper and seamstress for the cultured Skinner family. The Skinners pampered Barrett and educated her along with their own children, with an education in literature and mathematics. Living with the Skinners, young Barrett was exposed to privileged and refined people. As such, her childhood was atypical of the African-American community of that period soon after the Civil War. \n \nJulia Porter later married a railway worker and lived with him while still working for the Skinners; however Janie Porter Barrett continued to live with the Skinners. Mrs. Skinner wanted to become Janie’s legal guardian so that she could send her to a school in the northern USA where she could live as a white person. Julia Porter vetoed this plan and sent her daughter to the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, where she would live as a black person in a black environment. \n \nBarrett had never lived among African-Americans before attending the Hampton Institute. She also had to do manual labor for the first time at the Institute. Hampton emphasized vocational education, and the women were trained in morality and housekeeping in preparation for careers as wives or domestics. Barrett gradually adapted to the system at the Institute. While there Barrett was especially influenced by a novel about a cultured and advantaged woman similar to herself who devoted her life to social service. While at Hampton, she began to volunteer for community projects that helped people. Barrett trained as an elementary school teacher at the Institute. The Institute taught her lessons “in love of race, love of fellow-men, and love of country,” inculcating her with altruistic and patriotic values, and a sense of duty towards her race. Barrett graduated from the Hampton Institute in 1885. \n \nEarly Career : Barrett first worked as a teacher in a rural school in Dawson, and then at Lucy Craft Laney’s Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta, Georgia. She taught night school classes in the Hampton Institute from 1886 to 1889. In 1889 she married another Hampton graduate, Harris Barrett, the Institute’s cashier and bookkeeper. They had four children. Rather than settle for a comfortable life as a middle-class wife, Janie Porter Barrett devoted herself to social service work. The first major product of her early career was to create the Locust Street Social Settlement in 1890. The Locust Street Settlement was operated out of her home until her prominent husband, helped Barrett build a separate settlement facility in 1902. Locus Street settlement was the first of its kind in Virginia and the first social settlement for black people in the United States. Locust Street House was modeled on Jane Addams’s Hull House in Chicago and provided help to poor women, taught job skills, and educated  neighborhood children. Barrett’s approach to social reform also included interracial cooperation. white social reformers such as Jane Addams, who, in 1911, gave a Chicago tea party at Hull House in Barrett’s honor, to recognize her work. \n \nEditor’s Note :  A more detailed description of Locust Street Settlement in Hampton, VA is included in the HANDBOOK OF SETTLEMENTS EDITED BY ROBERT A. WOODS AND ALBERT J. KENNEDY and published by The Russell Sage Foundation in 1911. \n \nLater Career : Barrett’s approach to social reform also included interracial cooperation. White social reformers such as Jane Addams, who, in 1911, gave a Chicago tea party at Hull House in Barrett’s honor, recognized her work. In 1908 Barrett became a founder of the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs, an affiliate of the influential National Association of Colored Women. During the 1910 she forged important creative alliances with members and leaders of white women’s organizations in Virginia, particularly with Mary-Cooke Branch Munford, a Richmond social leader who worked for improvements in public education for children of both races.  Their assistance led to the Virginia Federation’s 1914 purchase of a farm in Hanover County to be used as a rehabilitation center for black girls in trouble with the law near Richmond, Virginia. \n \n(Editor’s Note : Mary-Cooke Branch Munford (1865-1938) was an advocate of woman suffrage, interracial cooperation, education, health, and labor reforms. Armed with a family pedigree that connected her to some of the wealthiest families of Virginia, she threw herself into at the time “unfeminine” pursuits such as education reform and civil rights. Maggie Lena Walker (1864- 1934) was an African-American teacher and businesswoman. Walker was the first female bank president of any race to charter a bank in the United States. As a leader, she achieved successes with the vision to make tangible improvements in the way of life for African-Americans and women. Disabled by paralysis and limited to a wheelchair later in life, Walker also became an example for people with disabilities. ) \n \nVirginia Industrial School \n \nBefore officially opening the facility, Barrett used consultation from Dr. Hastings Hart of the Russell Sage Foundation. She established a standard of care for dependent black children who had heretofore been treated poorly. At her home school, as it was called, Barrett created a growth promoting atmosphere for young black girls. The child welfare and educational principles used to foster the growth and development of the dependent girls in her care were adapted from the Child Welfare Department of the Russell Sage Foundation, now the Child Welfare League of America . Barrett’s expressed philosophy was akin to contemporary social work values. This program became a model for treatment services in which social work was used to provide safe housing, medical care, and job training for unmarried young black women and their children.  Barrett later became the superintendent of the innovative and successful Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls from 1915 until her retirement in 1940, by which time it had become part of the Virginia state system of schools for poor and needy girls. \n \nThe aim of the new institution was to help girls develop Christian character. Using rewards instead of punishments in its programs, Barrett emphasized the facility’s role as a home rather than a prison. Many activities were aimed at building agricultural and household skills, and cleanliness. Students were expected to work on farms or as domestics until they were able to establish their own homes. The models that had been prototyped at Hampton and at Tuskegee Institute were frequently replicated during Barrett’s tenure as institutional superintendent, and the student activities were regulated by the honor system. Her personality was really the glue that held the various program elements together. The residents of the Industrial School were, for the most part, delinquent or dependent colored girls sentenced to prison by local judges and then paroled to the school. There were no foster homes for colored girls who needed care and jail or prison was the only alternative. It is reported that several of the girls were “feeble minded” and a few arrived with contagious diseases. Regardless of the circumstances, the goal of the school was to teach self-direction and character building with the expectation that, when ready, a girl could be “paroled” to a private family in the Richmond area and work for normal wages. \n \nAs noted in the school’s “SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of The Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls — 1917,” the girls learned about and became engaged in routines of work, play, and religious activities. Among the work activities were the ordinary tasks of living in a rural setting: truck gardening, raising pigs, chickens and other animals. Housework skills such as laundry, ironing and dressmaking were also taught. Play activities focused on games, folk dancing, baseball and the celebration of holidays. Religious services in the early days rotated between an Episcopal and a Baptist service conducted by volunteer ministers. The “SECOND ANNUAL REPORT…” is a detailed history of the way the girls lived during its early years. The report describes the limited types of food they had to eat, and its sources. The report also details the games the girls were taught and played, their competitions, trials, difficulties, and occasional successes. The report concludes with details on the active involvement of the Board of Directors, volunteers and friends of the school, including who contributed what, how much, and for what reasons. \n \nBefore 1920, the Virginia State legislature provided funds to establish similar institutions for Caucasian girls and boys, but it did not extend this service to African American girls and boys. Barrett was constantly looking for outside support to supply the necessities of daily life at the school. Her annual reports contained thanks for the many items that had been donated and pleas for items such as blackboards, paint for the buildings, laundry equipment, library books, farm animals and equipment. Barrett was able to transcend traditional racial constraints and enlist the supportof many community members, both African American and white, to provide these much needed services to young AfricanAmerican women. \n \nThe “TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT” was submitted to the Board of Directors and the Commissioner of Public Welfare on June 30, 1939, by Superintendent, Janie Barrett Porter. It is a study in contrast with the Second Annual Report, highlighting the very positive development of the school property, roads and buildings, its curriculum for the girls, as well as health and welfare of the girls entrusted to the school by Virginia Judges and Courts. Of special note is the the spirit of interracial cooperation prevalent in the success of the school; the report makes several references to the courage of the African American and white women who contributed time and resources to the school which was not always a popular cause. \n \nThe correctional education work of Janie Porter Barrett was a remarkable series of accomplishments that helped students who were ready to improve or transform their lives. Barrett boldly used her influential position to advocate black voting and participation in government years before the civil rights movement. By 1920, with help from child welfare leaders such as Dr. Hastings Hart, the institution had achieved national recognition. The William E. Harman Award for Distinguished Achievement Among Negroes was presented to her in 1929. Two years after her death, on 27 August 1948, the Virginia General Assembly named the Hanover County school the Janie Porter Barrett School for Girls. It became racially integrated in 1965. The Virginia Industrial School exists today as the Barrett Learning Center. \n \nOther Achievements : In 1929 Barrett received the William E. Harmon Award for Distinguished Achievement among Negroes. In 1930 she took part in the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. She also served as the president of the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs for twenty-five years. She chaired the executive board of the National Association of Colored Women for four years. Barrett retired in 1940. She died in Hampton on August 27, 1948.  Most recently, the Virginia House of Delegates introduced the following RESOLUTION in honor of Janie Porter Barrett: \n \n2015 SESSION \n \nINTRODUCED \n \n15103473D \n \nHOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 239 \n \nOffered February 11, 2015 \n \nCommemorating the life and legacy of Janie Porter Barrett. \n \nPatrons––Peace, BaCote, Carr, Futrell, Herring, Hester, James, Keam, Lindsey, McQuinn, Preston, Spruill, Sullivan, Torian, Toscano, Tyler and Ward \n \n–––––––––– \n \nWHEREAS, 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Janie Porter Barrett, a dedicated educator and passionate civic leader who worked to enhance the quality of life and education for African American women in the Commonwealth; and \n \nWHEREAS, born in Athens, Georgia, in 1865, Janie Porter was educated at Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, one of the first training schools for freed people, which later became Hampton University; and \n \nWHEREAS, Janie Porter served the youths of Georgia and the Commonwealth as a teacher before marrying Harris Barrett in 1889 and settling in Hampton, where they raised four children; and \n \nWHEREAS, Janie Barrett was an active leader in the Hampton community, establishing the Locust Street Social Settlement, which hosted vocational clubs and classes, as well as youth athletic programs; and \n \nWHEREAS, in 1908, Janie Barrett founded and became the first president of the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs; during her 32-year tenure as president, the organization purchased a farm in Hanover County that became the Industrial Home School for Colored Girls; and \n \nWHEREAS, later renamed the Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls, the school opened in 1915 and taught vocational skills; Janie Barrett also actively worked to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of former students; and \n \nWHEREAS, in the 1920s, Janie Barrett continued to advocate for equal rights and social justice as a member of the Virginia Commission on Interracial Cooperation, the Richmond Urban League, and the National Association of Commissions for Women; and \n \nWHEREAS, Janie Barrett died in 1948; the school she founded was later renamed the Janie Porter Barrett School for Girls, in honor of her exceptional legacy of care and support for the AfricanAmerican community; now, therefore, be it \n \nRESOLVED by the House of Delegates, That the life and legacy of Janie Porter Barrett hereby be commemorated on the 150th anniversary of her birth; and, be it \n \nRESOLVED FURTHER, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates prepare copies of this resolution for presentation to the Virginia Historical Society and the Hanover Heritage Alliance as an expression of the House of Delegates’ admiration for Janie Porter Barrett’s achievements as an educator and community leader. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \nThe post Barrett, Janie Porter (1865 – 1948): African-American Social Welfare Activist appeared first on Social Welfare History Project .
0501_f6b0279d-04fd-4696-8edf-5824ea3f7410	Tony Abbott has urged Liberal voters dismayed with his dumping to get behind  Malcolm Turnbull, even if they have to do so "through gritted teeth". \n\nIn a lengthy interview on 2GB with his friend and backer Ray Hadley, Mr Abbott also claimed he would have survived had the plotters waited until after the September 19 Canning byelection because the Liberal Party's internal polling had the government on track for a strong result under his leadership. \n\n"The Liberal Party's internal polling the weekend before the Canning byelection was that we were going to end up with 57 per cent of the two-party preferred vote," Mr Abbott said. \n\n"One of the reasons why the ballot had to be brought on the week it was brought on by the proponents of a ballot was because a strong result in Canning, which is what we were going to get, would have put paid to this notion that somehow I was unelectable because of the polls." \n\nThe Liberals won Canning by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. \n\nMr Abbott also shot down theories that he would have survived had he moved earlier to dump Joe Hockey as Treasurer and removed his chief of staff Peta Credlin, claiming those out to get him would have stopped at nothing. \n\n"The idea that people who were hungry for advancement would somehow be mollified if Joe went or if my chief of staff went is just nonsense," he said. \n\n"When someone is absolutely focussed on a particular objective, they're not going to be put off if they're thrown a few human sacrifices as it were and frankly, it's wrong to feed this particular beast." \n\nAppealing to Liberal voters dismayed with his dumping, Mr Abbott said Australia did not need a sixth prime minister in six years. \n\n"It would be even worse if we were to end up with a CFMEU-dominated government, which we could well do at the next election," he said. \n\n"Even if they have to do it through gritted teeth, support the Coalition, support the Prime Minister, support the government."  \n\nMr Abbott also disputed a claim by Scott Morrison that the now-Treasurer tried to warn Mr Abbott of the brewing leadership coup three days before it was sprung on Monday, September 14. \n\n"Certainly, there was a conversation as I understand it between Scott and Peta Credlin. He's obviously put one construction on the conversation, my office put a different construction on the conversation," he said. \n\n"It's probably a bit counterproductive to revisit all of this now, the last thing I want Ray, to come out of this interview is a headline 'Abbott slams Morrison'. \n\n"In the end, I suppose all of us have got to answer to our God and our consciences, I'm just not going  \nto get into who might have said what, who should have said what, to whom and when." \n\nMr Abbott declined to be drawn on the actions of Julie Bishop or Mr Morrison, both of whom were critical to his ousting. \n\nHe said they were "extremely effective ministers in my government" and "I'd expect them to continue to be very effective ministers in the new government". \n\nMr Abbott called for an end to what he called "the revolving door prime ministership". \n\n"This is a real problem for our country because the last four changes of prime minister, only one has been at the hands of the people, the other three have been at the hands of what the public would think is a backroom cabal," he said. \n\n"The difficulty with the revolving door prime ministership is that Government can't do what is necessary for the long-term good of our country if you're subject to death by polls and then ultimately a partyroom coup.  \n\n"It's very difficult to do the right thing by our country if this kind of thing happens. My hope is that what happened a fortnight ago finishes all of this stuff." \n\nHe urged Liberal MPs to "stick with the leader" through ups and downs because "people of character and steadiness don't panic at the polls, they stick with good policy". \n\nHe repeated his claim that there was nothing untoward about his leadership because Mr Turnbull had adopted the same policies and language. \n\n"The interesting thing is that no policy has changed since the change of prime minister," he said. \n\nHe listed same-sex marriage, climate change, border protection policy, and national security, policy. \n\nAnd both Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison were "even using exactly the same phrases that Joe Hockey and I were using" such as Australia has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. \n\n"We do want lower simpler fairer taxes, we are building for the future, these were things that I said that Joe said and now of course Malcolm and Scott are saying because they're right, they're absolutely right," he said. \n\nMr Abbott thanked Hadley for campaigning for him in Opposition and government. \n\n"Thank you for six good years and I really am very, very grateful," he said.  \n\nHadley asked if Mr Abbott was okay in terms of his mental health. \n\nMr Abbott said he was fine and he had no immediate plans to quit politics. \n\n"I always knew that politics was a pretty brutal business. It's a game of snakes and ladders and yes I've hit a snake," he said. \n\nHe listed his achievements as stopping the boats, abolishing the mining and carbon taxes, starting the task of budget repair, sealing three free trade agreements, moving ahead with the second Sydney airport at Badgery's Creek, ending business welfare, starting the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, and "ending the , green veto on big projects". \n\n Mr Abbott was ousted in a coup on September 14. He lost to Mr Turnbull by 54 votes to 44 votes. The next day, he promised not to destabilise his successor. \n\n"Leadership changes are never easy for our country," Mr Abbott said on September 15. \n\n"My pledge today is to make this change as easy as I can. There will be no wrecking, no undermining, and no sniping." \n\nPrior to the Hadley interview, he has given The Daily Telegraph two interviews and one to The Australian.  \n\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce, a Nationals MP, said on Monday night he believed Mr Abbott would have stepped aside before the election had it become apparent to him he could ot have won. \n\n"I think that what would have been better, to be honest, is if Tony had stepped down," he told the ABC's Q&A program. \n\n"It was becoming quite clear that the polls were saying it was unlikely he would be able to win, I don't think Tony would have taken us over a cliff." \n\nFormer Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, whose government was booted out after one term, told the ABC's 7.30 program on Monday night that the changed media environment and tougher community attitudes made it harder to govern.  \n\n"The more you try and do, the more controversy, you'll be ripped apart in this black and white environment of reporting and what masquerades as debate," Mr Newman said. \n\n"The message is the less you do, the less you take on vested interests, the less you want to undertake reform, the more you'll be rewarded in the polls. \n\n"And that's a sad state of affairs."
0502_0c1280de-d9a2-4461-b02c-9e0befcf8280	Facebook has a lot to answer for but the recent post highlighting free Calpol on the NHS served a useful purpose.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tResponsible comment served to educate the public that isn’t a national scheme (unless you live in Scotland) and that there is huge variability in what is available, depending upon where you happen to live. Indeed, NHS Choices made changes to its website to explain the situation.  \n\n\n\t  \n \n\n\tA bewildered public would be right in thinking that this was no way to run a health service.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tThe English Pharmacy Board has been running a campaign on how pharmacists can relieve some of the pressures on urgent and emergency care. We have highlighted the benefits of pharmacists working in A and E departments and secured a trial, the results of which are due soon. We have also been pressing for the adoption of a national Minor Ailments Scheme.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tThe RPS is now represented on a number of groups working with the NHS England Urgent and Emergency Care Review Team. We have consistently pressed the case for a national minor ailments service and have stressed that no training resource is required because dealing with common ailments is something community pharmacists do on a daily basis. We have also engaged with people who will be reviewing the national pharmacy contract and made similar representations.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tThe reality is that senior civil servants are, to some extent, at the beck and call of their political masters. The current buzz word on Politics Street is localism. Hence, there is a desire for local commissioners to have more say over which services are commissioned locally.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tAs pharmacists we all recognise that consistency would make sense. At the moment it is hard to predict which way this service will go, so the EPB continues to press for a national scheme. If localism wins the day then we have also been saying that there needs to be more consistency in how the service is delivered nationally.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tYou can help. If you are interested in lobbying your local MP then get in touch, join our list of Politicos and take advantage of some practical RPS support. Find out more about the campaign and how to get involved at www.rpharms.com/urgentcare.  \n \n\n\t  \n \n\n\tThe urgent care campaign is just one of many ways in which the RPS represents and raises the profile of the profession, but we could not do this without the support of our members.

0504_752b7643-eb79-4d93-91b1-e33b724e8f42	Dear September,\nYou are my most favorite month of the year. You are just perfect. You begin with the continuation of the lovely summer nights of star gazing and s'mores. And then you gently slide into the coziness of fall with your cooler nights and brilliant leaves. What a perfect mixture! I'm totally looking forward to it.\nDear Best Day of the Year,\nHey there Birthday!! You are coming up... only 18 more days until I am 27! I can be kind of a monster on my birthday, so I am going to try and keep it under control. I do want to fill it with lovely outdoor fun (kayaking, hiking, biking), back deck grilling, ice cream, and maybe a piñata if I am really lucky.\nDear Hot Husband,\nYou are wonderful. I am so grateful for you. You work hard and you're just the most handsome and kind person ever, not to mention hilarious. You have a soul of gold and I am so happy we have each other. I know my birthday can be stressful because I just love it so much. Just know that the best gift you can give me is what you already do all of the time... going on adventures and making meaningful memories with me. You're my forever fave.\nDear Apple Orchard,\nWe pass by you everyday on the way to work and this week you were suddenly dotted with fabulous red. We can't wait to come gather some farm apples for ourselves. Maybe we will pair them with some fresh peanut butter from the Market Wagon - the Mennonite shop down the road. Now that would be a true rural experience. Delicious!\nDear New Car,\nYou are a beauty and you have finally made us a 2 car family!! (as of YESTERDAY!) After 6 1/2 years of marriage with one car, we are pretty excited about this. I have decided to name you Luna. Mainly because I am obsessed with the majestic night sky. Also, my bike is Stella ("star" in Latin), so Luna ("moon" in Latin) fits perfectly. We are always up for awesome adventures, so I hope you enjoy that kind of thing. Welcome to the gang!\nDear Car Buying Process,\nYou are miserable. I now have first hand experience and get why people don't enjoy you very much. Don't get me wrong, I love the end result, I am just so glad we don't have to deal with you very often. I wash my hands of you and your stress!\nDear School Supplies,\nYou tempt me with your fresh crayons, endless notebooks, and promise of learning. I was able to resist a small box of crayons the other day, but only when I considered how many crayons I already have at home. You are one of my favorite aisles to wander and you will always have a special place in my heart.  Maybe I will start assigning myself creative research projects so I have an excuse for some supplies.  Xoxo, Katie

The eclectic line-up spans established international punk bands as well as young bands and local acts. \n \nThe first batch of super early bird tickets went on sale on August 31 and sold out within just over 24 hours – more tickets are on sale now for £18 per person. \n \nMM chatted to Tim ‘Bev’ Bevington, of TNS Records – one of the promoters and labels behind the festival – about the overwhelming show of support. \n \nHe said: “We were absolutely blown away by the amount of people that supported us both last year and by buying the super early bird tickets.” \n \nThe desire for a festival such as MPF is understandable when you consider the city’s musical history. \n \nThere is a fair argument for Manchester being the birthplace of DIY punk music – home-grown punk icons Buzzcocks released the first successful record with their Spiral Scratch EP in 1977. \n \nHowever, the festival’s success does not paint the whole picture of DIY punk in Manchester at the moment. \n \nAlthough Bev described the scene as ‘thriving’, he also highlighted the struggles it has faced due to the recent closure of a number of small venues across the city. \n \nThe most notable venue closures to impact the scene were The Ducie Bridge – which had asserted itself as the home of DIY punk over recent months – in August and The Roadhouse two months earlier. \n \nBoth were known for putting on DIY gigs for young bands. \n \nIan ‘Tree’ Robinson who works with Anarchistic Undertones – another of the promotion companies that organises MPF – shared Bev’s views. \n \nHe said: “It’s not just Ducie, places like Kraak, Star & Garter and others have also felt the pinch of gentrification over recent years and there’s nothing any of us can do about it other than searching for new spaces to use.” \n \nThere is a clear problem – the closure of smaller venues threatens the opportunities for young bands to perform and establish themselves and it is these young bands that the DIY punk scene depends upon. \n \nAs the venues close down, and the cost of putting on gigs in the remaining places increases, so the more underground music is being pushed out of the city centre. \n \nBev said: “The closure of the Ducie Bridge has definitely highlighted how it is getting harder to find a cheap central venue for small gigs. \n \n“With the planned development around Oxford Road Station, I can't see things improving.” \n \nThe promoters the festival – TNS Records, Anarchistic Undertones and Moving North - aim to combat this trend, providing a central platform for these bands, as well as encouraging people to listen to and get involved with Manchester’s DIY music scene. \n \nThe event will take place across venues primarily in the Oxford Road area, with events at Sound Control, The Thirsty Scholar, Zombie Shack, Zoo and Retro Bar. \n \nThe success of MPF is evidence of a vibrant and hard-working underground punk movement in Manchester that is defying the pattern set by the closure of performance spaces. \n \nAccessibility for all is central to the ethos of DIY punk. \n \nMPF2016: Manchester Punk Festival will take place across a number of city centre venues  (©Andy Davies)  \nSignificant emphasis is placed in treating the established bands and the younger bands alike. \n \nOf primary concern is the maintenance, each year, of affordable ticket prices. \n \nSpeaking to the promoters and labels from within the scene, it is clear that a sense of community and involvement is paramount. \n \nOf his time involved with DIY punk at The Ducie Bridge, Ian said: “I spent every minute I had spare in there helping with whatever I could, booking promoters in, bar work, renovating the venue upstairs, all sorts of different things.” \n \nHe was eager to point out that this co-operative community mentality extends beyond musicians, promoters and venues. \n \nLocal designers, artists and printers are all involved in the creation of MPF. \n \nKieran Kelly of Moving North told a story about making some of his closest friends at a DIY gig at The Star & Garter on the day he first moved to Manchester. \n \nBut he fears for the possibility of such positive impact of a music scene on individuals in the future. \n \nHe said: “I worry if any venues like that are going to host experiences like that moving forward.” \n \nSo MPF, and the DIY scene it represents, is not purely about putting on gigs. \n \nAlso important is the continuation of a community of like-minded musicians and music fans having an opportunity to do what they love. \n \nThe dedicated response to the threat of venues becoming increasingly inaccessible, spearheaded by larger events like MPF, ensures that those involved are confident that the future remains positive for DIY punk in Manchester. \n \nAndy Davies – the artist behind the festival’s logo, and Bev’s co-worker at TNS – told MM: “Hopefully MPF can also introduce people to the wide amount of great bands that are active in the underground punk scene in the UK and encourage people to check out gigs throughout the year helping these venues to stay open.” \n \nIn the face of the closures the primary focus remains, as ever, to promote DIY and Underground music. \n \nAll three of the promotions companies involved highlighted the value of combining each different promoter’s specialism within the genres into one event in which variety is a key factor. \n \nKieran said the central aim of MPF is to get the names of punk artists out there to audiences they might not usually play for. \n \nHe said: “Its smashing three different promoters together to get bands playing in front of people they might not usually, and get people watching some bands that they might not come across any other way.” \n \nRather than lamenting the losses and difficulties faced by the underground elements of Manchester’s legendary music culture, those involved with DIY punk are focused on ensuring that they can weather the storm. \n \nBy creating opportunities for bands within the scene to get themselves heard and appreciated, those behind MPF prove to be vital in maintaining the city’s rich and varied underground culture. \n \nOne of the fundamental elements of the punk ethos was always that anybody can get up and do something good if they are willing to work hard. \n \nThe DIY punks of Manchester undoubtedly continue in this vein. \n \nHopefully this will be noticed and Manchester’s smaller venues will experience the positive impact of people becoming more engaged with grass-roots music and culture. \n \nTickets for Manchester Punk Festival can be purchased directly by clicking here . \n \nMain image courtesy of Taro Taylor, with thanks.
0507_63b1c3e1-7abd-40ad-99f6-b9231e16425b	So how critical can the NFL’s broadcast partners be of Roger Goodell? \n \nWhile thinking about my annual preview of how the football-airing networks will bring you the NFL this season — I looked at CBS below and will do the other networks throughout the week amid other columns — I was curious how executives at CBS, ESPN, Fox and NBC would answer the question above. Obviously, there’s no need to ask the league-owned NFL Network the question given it would be like asking state-run China Central Television if they can criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n \nWhat you rarely see (if ever) from the NFL’s television partners is in-game criticism of Goodell’s decision-making. The pregame shows occasionally tackle league-wide issues but they rarely go beyond top-line discussion and most savvy viewers already know which television talent will go soft on the league and which talent is the designated hitter. Here’s how the executives answered the question (predictably, I’d say), but how they did offers a bit of their network’s philosophy, at least within the game: \n \nCBS Sports chairman Sean McManus: \n \n“I don’t see our job as being critical. I see our job as letting our analysts express their opinions, and if they have negative opinions on something the NFL has done or something Roger has done, they are free to express that opinion. We don’t put any kind of limitations on them. But I don’t look at our job as praising or criticizing any individual, including Roger Goodell. I look at our job as evaluating it fairly and expressing that evaluation through our analysts and commentators.”​ \n \nFox Sports president Eric Shanks: \n \n“We don’t ever dictate or give guidelines to announcers to what they can and can’t say. Whether it is Jimmy Johnson or Troy Aikman or Randy Moss, I don’t think they have ever heard Fox Sports say don’t say what is on your mind or what you feel in an appropriate situation. I think everyone who has a microphone at Fox Sports has said whatever they have wanted to say.” \n \nESPN Monday Night Football producer Jay Rothman: \n \n“Well, I think Mike [Tirico] and Jon [Gruden] need to shoot straight in their opinions.  I don't think we’re out there to blast Roger or blast the NFL. We’re there to cover a football game. But if there are things that we don’t agree with and Mike and Jon don’t agree with, we certainly encourage them to have the forum to express that. But our goal is not to lambaste Roger. We’re there to cover the games.” \n \nNBC Sunday Night Football coordinating producer Fred Gaudelli: \n \n“I think you can be critical when there are mistakes and missteps. Now, sometimes you have information you have gathered that unfortunately is off the record but someone tells you, ‘This is what really happened but you can’t use it.’ So you have some knowledge of it. But I have never heard a word from the league about anything we have ever done that might shine a negative light. If it was wrong, I might hear a word. Look, can we be as free-wheeling as Bill Simmons? No, of course not. But obviously ESPN did not think they could be either because he’s no longer there. There is no question it is a delicate balance but I can tell you Roger Goodell has never called me and said, ‘Why did you do that?’ Nor have any of his assistants or people like that at the league level.” \n \n• BISHOP: Jones leads Packers in Week 1 | FARRAR: Ryan wins in debut \n THE NOISE REPORT  \nSI.com examines some of the week’s most notable sports media stories \n \n1. Some thoughts on CBS’s NFL coverage this year: \n \nWhile the broadcaster pairings at CBS remain essentially the same from last year (more on that below) CBS has given its The NFL Today studio show an aesthetics makeover. The show has a new set, a new opener (which pushed Super Bowl 50, noting that it would air “exclusively” on CBS 147 days from Sunday) and has embraced the favorite new move of television consultants — having studio talent standing or moving rather than sitting behind a desk. On Sunday, host James Brown opened the first segment standing as he introduced the games of the day. He then sent it over to analysts Bill Cowher and Tony Gonzalez (standing at another part of the studio), who passed the baton to analysts Bart Scott and Boomer Esiason (standing in another part of the studio) who sent it over to insider Jason LaCanfora (standing in another part of the studio). What was clear, outside of the thesis that such movement will keep the viewer occupied, was that the segment was sponsored by Southwest Airlines. \n  \nNFL has Patriots on 'high alert' \n \nSports Illustrated senior writer Michael Rosenberg discusses how the league will approach the New England Patriots following the new allegations against the team. \n    \nWas the show better than last year? Well, it felt fresher and the set certainly looked great. The bumper spots to breaks were also very sharp, too. But speed isn’t always great for viewers. Cowher delivered something interesting during a roundtable discussion — the former Steelers coach said headset issues happen for NFL coaches in every city and that it wasn’t unusual — but he offered no follow-up or specifics why that wasn’t unusual. So viewers were not educated on the issue outside of knowing the segment was sponsored by Dominos. The in-show crossover to the NFL Network’s GameDay crew seemed only for the promotional benefit of both networks — and not viewers. Interestingly, when the group got behind the desk and did a segment on which teams were on the rise (they highlighted the Chiefs , Dolphins , Vikings and Eagles ), it was the most viewer-friendly part of the show. I thought it was very thoughtful of the producers (fronted by Brown) to acknowledge the death of basketball great Moses Malone . One additional note for viewers: There is very little fantasy focus on The NFL Today . \n \n• BANKS: Week 1 snaps |   Week 1 hub |   Moses and Me: Idolizing a legend \n \n1a. The 2015 CBS NFL broadcast group has some minor changes from 2014. The lineup: \n \nNo. 1: Jim Nantz, Phil Simms and reporter Tracy Wolfson \nNo. 2: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts and reporter Evan Washburn \nNo. 3: Greg Gumbel, Trent Green and reporter Jamie Erdahl \nNo. 4: Kevin Harlan and Rich Gannon \nNo. 5: Spero Dedes and Solomon Wilcots \nNo. 6: Andrew Catalon, Steve Tasker and analyst Steve Beuerlein \nNo. 7: Tom McCarthy and Adam Archuleta \nNo. 8: Brian Anderson and Chris Simms \n \n“I think we have the best and deepest team of announcers for all the networks,” said McManus, echoing a line all executives would say about their talent. \n \n1b. CBS will air 104 regular-season games including some NFC crossover games. In addition to the AFC package of games, CBS’s schedule features NFC games including Carolina at Dallas (Thanksgiving Day); Chicago at Seattle (Sept. 27); St. Louis at Green Bay (Oct. 11) as well as other NFC crossover flex games to be determined later in the season. \n \n1c. The two biggest games on the CBS’s regular season NFL lineup? I’d vote New England at Dallas (Oct. 11) and Denver at Indianapolis (Nov. 8). \n \n• BANKS: 20 bold predictions for this season  | Season’s burning questions \n \n1d. CBS will broadcast the first seven games of the Thursday Night schedule before handing off to the NFL Network (using CBS’s talent and game production team) on Nov. 5. CBS then returns on Dec. 3 to air the Packers at Lions before NFL Network finishes the schedule. “The transition both the first and second time from CBS to the NFL Network is critical because we want to make sure the NFL Network grows as well as CBS grows,” McManus said. \n \n1e. I’m going to highlight at times how often an interviewer is shown during a feature piece on an NFL-related show. See thoughts on this here . Gonzalez was shown four times during his segment on Texan defensive linemen J.J. Watt and Vince Wilfork . \n \n1f. Clip and save: Gonzalez picked the Bills to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl against the Seahawks . \n \n1g. Fox NFL Kickoff analyst Champ Bailey , on the lack of success in Washington. “It’s all about leadership and it starts at the top. You look at Dan Snyder. Back in 1999 I was a young rookie, the summer before my first season, he had just bought the team. He walks into the team meeting, looks at everybody in the room and says words that I probably can’t repeat right now. But he made it known that he was going to make it hard for you to work for him. Now how do you want to win for a guy that sets that kind of precedence? You have a coach that fears you, (and) players don’t respect your coach because he fears you. How do you get the players to play?“ \n \n1h. Prior to the Rams’ overtime win over the Seahawks , here was NFL Network analyst Michael Robinson (former Seattle fullback): “I’m concerned about the psychology of the Seattle Seahawks on game day. [Holdout safety] Kam [Chancellor] is a big contributor to that. He’s a guy who speaks to the team before the team goes out. He’s the guy who speaks to the rest of the defensive backs before they take the field, he gets guys lined up.” \n \n• FARRAR: Loss proves it’s time for Seahawks, Chancellor to end holdout \n \n1i. The Patriots’ 28–21 win over the Steelers last Thursday averaged 27.4 million viewers, the second most-watched kickoff game in the 14-year history of the event. The game peaked at 30.2 million viewers and was television’s most-watched show since the 2015 NCAA men’s basketball championship (28.3 million viewers on CBS). The Top 10 markets were: 1. Boston 2. Pittsburgh 3. Providence 4. Baltimore 5. Richmond 6. Norfolk 7. Buffalo 8. West Palm Beach 9. Cleveland 10. Denver \n \n1j. The NFL Network’s airing of Do Your Job: Bill Belichick and the 2014 Patriots  averaged 465,000 viewers, the most-watched NFL Network original programming presentation in 2015 among 18–49 year-olds. \n \n1k. HBO’s Hard Knocks with the Houston Texans averaged 874,000 viewers over its run, which is the show’s most-viewed series behind only the 2010 New York Jets edition (898,000 average viewership) since 2002. \n \n1l. Former Patriots player and NBC Football Night in America analyst Rodney Harrison on whether any Patriots coach gave him signals from opponents: \n \n“I can honestly tell you this. No coach — Ernie (Adams), the guy that’s accused in the report — never came up to us and gave us any calls, any signals, ever said, ‘Hey, you need to play this defense.’ When I was out there on the field, I was the strong safety. I was in charge of making the defensive calls, just as well as Tedy Bruschi. Sometimes, we would confer and say, ‘Hey, can I change this call?’ and he’d say, ‘Yeah, Hot Rod, make a check.’ How do we know ... even if the coaches knew, even if Ernie knew, how would they relay that back to us? That’s the disappointing part, because you know we worked so hard to be great players and to have a great team in 2003 and 2004. We never made excuses when the New York Giants beat us in the Super Bowl. We said, ‘You know what, they played better, they’re the champions, and that’s it.’ But when it comes to the Patriots, every time we just win, whether it’s us bugging a locker room, or taping something, it always has to come with something with it — and that’s the disappointing part.” \n \n• PRICE: The shrinking commish: Goodell’s days as disciplinarian numbered \n \n2.  Multiple sources at ESPN have told Sports Illustrated that a number of ESPN’s NFL and OTL staffers have received threatening phone calls, emails and tweets — well beyond the usual sports media criticism or angry social media blasts — over the network’s reporting of the Patriots and allegations of cheating. Some tweets have included threats of physical violence. (One ESPNer described the Twitter attacks as “vile.”) Another source said ESPN security has been involved. Emails have alluded to meeting up with ESPN staffers when they are working in Boston. Family members of ESPN staffers have also dealt directly with threats. When asked about the severity of the threats and whether ESPN security is involved, an ESPN spokesperson said, “We are going to decline comment.” \n \n2a. On a related issue, Boston Globe media reporter Chad Finn had a worth-reading piece last week on ESPN’s curious editing of Patriots reporter Mike Reiss. ESPN declined comment to SI on why Reiss was edited other than what they initially told Pro Football Talk . “The story was given a tighter edit.” Very tough position for Reiss, a quality reporter and a guy who has to take one for the team here by not commenting. He declined comment to SI last week. \n \n2b. On Friday I reported that Bomani Jones , the co-host of ESPN’s Highly Questionable and the host of ESPN Radio’s The Right Time with Bomani Jones show, will move from evenings to the 4–7 p.m. ET shift previously occupied by The Dan LeBatard Show (which replaced Colin Cowherd’s show). Said an ESPN spokesperson: “We expect to make an announcement about the 4–7 slot shortly.” \n \n3. The 18th episode of the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast features ESPN digital host Antonietta (Toni) Collins, who anchors news and analysis video segments in every sport category for ESPN.com and has also hosted studio shows for the network. In the episode, Collins talks about how she got her start in journalism, what it's like being the only Latina reporter in locker rooms, the benefits and challenges of being a bilingual reporter, how the coverage of Hispanic athletes can improve, what she's learned from her mother María Antonieta Collins, a well-known broadcast journalist in Mexico, what she hopes is next for her career and more. \n \nA reminder: you can subscribe to the podcast on iTunes and you can view all of SI's podcasts here . \n \n4.

0509_f6e5c4a3-35c4-4795-b252-8509ab810bc7	Jimmy Graham caught lots of passes, Tyler Lockett returned another kick for a touchdown, a Kam Chancellor-infused defense kept the Bears in check, and for an afternoon all was right again in the Seahawks’ world. In their regular-season home opener, the Seahawks overcame a slow start to blow out the bumbling Bears 26-0 in front of a CenturyLink Field-record crowd of 69,002. The one ominous note was a hamstring injury that sidelined running back Marshawn Lynch in the second half, limiting him to five carries for the game. BEARS AT SEAHAWKS»Photo galleryFull coverageGrading the game: How the Seahawks fared in rout of BearsSeahawks get Jimmy Graham more involved in win over BearsFirst impressions from Bob Condotta, Jayson Jenks, Larry Stone and moreWeb reaction: Fans and media exhale as Seahawks earn first winTyler Lockett sets team record with 105-yard kickoff return for TDMarshawn Lynch misses second half after milking leg injuryGallery: Scenes from the Seahawks' home openerMatt Calkins finds superstitious Seahawks fans who lost the Super BowlAnd the caveat is that the win came against a beat-up Bears team playing without starting quarterback Jay Cutler. But after a sluggish first half in which Seattle led just 6-0, the final two quarters looked like the Seahawks of old. Lockett got the run started with a team-record 105-yard return of the second-half kickoff for a touchdown. The Seattle offense then uncorked a couple long drives, with Russell Wilson capping one with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Graham, who finished with seven catches for 83 yards after a week when his role in the Seahawks’ offense was heavily discussed. The Seahawks outgained the Bears 162-24 in the third quarter. The defense played stout throughout and recorded Seattle’s first shutout since a 23-0 win against the Giants in New York on Dec.15, 2013. It was the first time the Bears had been shutout since 2002. The Seahawks are 1-2 and get an extra day off this week before hosting Detroit next Monday night. Offense Lynch didn’t start and didn’t come onto the sideline until midway through the first quarter as he dealt with back and calf injuries. Lynch had 14 yards on five carries and one reception for nine and then did not play the second half because of a hamstring injury. There was no initial word on the severity of the injury. But the aches and pains are also beginning to pile up for the 29-year-old Lynch, and Seattle may have to get used to the idea of no longer being able to base its offense around him. The good news is that the Seahawks appear to have found something in rookie Thomas Rawls, who made the team as an undrafted free agent and got the bulk of the work in place of Lynch. Rawls showed the ability to hit cutback runs that is necessary in this offense, notably on a 21-yarder early in the third quarter. Rawls finished with 101 yards as the Seahawks used fullbacks Derrick Coleman and Will Tukuafu more than in any game this season to set up the running game. Seattle failed to convert its first seven third-down opportunities before breaking through on a pass from Wilson to Doug Baldwin midway through the third quarter. The first offensive play of the game went to Graham, and he finished the first half with a game-high four receptions for 44 yards. However, he was not able to come down with a pass on a fade route in the end zone late in the second quarter as the Seahawks twice had to settle for field goals in the first half on possessions inside the Chicago 20-yard line. The Seahawks had just 48 yards on 13 plays until going to the hurry-up in the final minutes of the second quarter and going on a 77-yard 12-play drive. The offensive line, though, had issues pass protecting throughout with Wilson sacked four times by a Chicago team that didn’t have any in its first four games. Grade: B-minus. Defense Chancellor started and played pretty regularly throughout — he did not start the fourth series of the first half but came in midway through. Unofficially, he played 23 of 30 snaps in the first half. The Seahawks gave up some yards on the ground early with Matt Forte rushing for 64 yards on 15 carries in the first half. But the Seahawks didn’t bend, holding the Bears to 3 for 8 on third-down conversions and forcing punts on all five possessions in the first half. The Seahawks played more base defense knowing the Bears would concentrate on the run. Brandon Mebane left in the first half because of a hamstring injury, which forced Jordan Hill to play almost every down the rest of the way. Rookie Frank Clark also saw his most action, playing often as an end in the base defense, and held up well. How much of an impact Chancellor made is a little hard to gauge given the feebleness and simplicity of the Bears’ offense — Chicago had 21 runs to just nine passes in the first half. Grade: A. Special teams Special teams were pretty much the difference in this one early on as a trick punt return set up Seattle’s first score and Lockett’s kickoff return helped break the game open. Lockett was sprung down the sideline on a good block by Ricardo Lockette, and then he went basically untouched for the longest return in Seattle history. The Seahawks effectively pulled off some trickery early, using the same play the St. Louis Rams had against them last year to set up Richard Sherman for a 64-yard punt return. On the play, the Seahawks faked as if they were setting up Tyler Lockett for a return to the right side of the field but the ball went to Sherman on the left. He got to the Chicago 19-yard line to set up Steven Hauschka’s 31-yard field goal to open the scoring. One negative — some shaky blocking on a couple of Jon Ryan punts that were tipped, with the Seahawks catching some breaks took favorable Seattle bounces. Hauschka was perfect on four field-goal attempts, and the coverage was solid enough. Grade: A-minus.
0510_f6a4469c-c526-4875-bc51-e780fb0bf04a	Echoing his witty writing style, Bill Bryson's memoir of his trek up the Appalachian Trail is adapted as a gently amusing comedy that combines big landscapes with sharp observational humour. Even though it centres on two old men, the film's message is almost identical to Reese Witherspoon's Wild, except that this movie never preaches at all. Instead, it meanders along with a wry smile and an ear for a snappy punchline.\n\nBill (Robert Redford) has moved back to America with his English wife Catherine (Emma Thompson) after living in Britain for 20 years. And now he feels the need to reconnect with his homeland. So he decides to hike the 2,100-mile mountain path from Georgia to Maine. Catherine insists that he takes someone with him, but the only volunteer is Katz (Nick Nolte), a wheezing ex-alcoholic with whom Bill deliberately lost touch. Even so, they set off on their walk, having a series of small adventures as they meet other hikers (including the hilariously too-perky Kristen Schaal), flirt with a hotel owner (Mary Steenburgen) and get into a bit of trouble when Katz has a romp with a married woman (Susan McPhail). They also encounter a couple of grizzly bears and find themselves trapped overnight on a narrow mountain ledge.\n\nThe question obviously isn't whether or not they complete the epic trek. No, this is a film about how self-discovery continues into old age, and so does the ability to discover new things in the world. Director Ken Kwapis makes the most of the picturesque landscapes, while including superb details that make the journey come to life. Although there are several sequences that were obviously shot in a studio with a fake backdrop and green-screen vistas. And some of the events along the way are badly contrived, dipping into silly slapstick. On the other hand, the running conversation between these two long-time friends is priceless.\n\nRedford and Nolte make a surprisingly engaging double-act, bouncing off each other with impeccable timing and never being afraid to act their age. Redford looks amazing for 79, playing the 64-year-old Bryson, who was 46 when he took this hike. At 74, Nolte seems older. Both of them also spark terrific chemistry with the characters they meet along the way. And they refuse to allow any sentimentality to creep into the movie, undercutting everything with a snappy joke. So the deeper meaning emerges subtly, encouraging us to think about the importance of dropping out of the rat race from time to time just to catch our breath. And maybe to get some inspiration for what's to come.\n\nby Rich Cline\n\nWatch the trailer for A Walk In The Woods here
0511_0069ae3d-1e17-4a75-bf27-8bd961c6a2ed	B rand investment in mobile advertising is growing quickly — spending is projected to reach $46 bn in 2019, according to Forrester — yet only 1% of those ads receive any type of engagement. \n \nWhat tools and resources do advertisers and agencies have to report and analyse the 99% of unclicked impressions? These ad impressions have value, but there are only flawed and debatable tools for measurement. \n \nImpressions shouldn’t be wasted \n \nUnclicked ads should not be universally discounted as wasted impressions. A recent mobile advertising neuroscience study from Sharethrough and Nielsen showed how impressions can influence brand perception. Analytics platforms, from Moat to IAS, have focused heavily on viewability by making certain that ads are viewable. Contrary to the IAB standard for viewability, which is “a minimum of 50% of pixels in view for a minimum of one second,” WPP agency GroupM and Unilever announced earlier this year that they would only count video impressions when 100% of the ad player is in view. \n \nAdditional measurement techniques are needed to help the industry gauge the value of a viewable impression, especially on a mobile device where a full-screen, viewable impression means a captivated audience. \n \nSurvey measurement is flawed \n \nSince the dawn of the commercial internet, the value of display ad impressions has largely been measured through surveys. These are usually online audiences, segmented by consumers who have and have not seen a marketing campaign or creative and asked to respond to a brand perception questionnaire. This approach only taps into a person’s conscious brain — a major shortcoming. \n \nSubconscious brain activity \n \nAccording to research from the Laboratory for Cognitive Psychophysiology at the University of Illinois, only 5% of the brain’s activity is expended on conscious activity. The remaining brain activity is devoted largely to unconscious processing. Developing a more comprehensive measurement system for mobile impressions will require tapping deeper into subconscious activity. Wearable devices that track neurological activity are readily available to consumers, from MindWave to MUSE and Melon. \n \nUse eye-tracking \n \nA number of software and hardware companies are developing advanced eye-tracking and emotion-sensing tools, such as Tobii and PredictGaze. Extending these technologies to work with the front-facing camera on smartphones only makes sense. I predict that Samsung’s Smart Scroll feature, which uses eye-tracking software to page up or down, will be deployed for advertising measurement in the not-too-distant future. To assuage understandable consumer privacy concerns, companies developing this technology would require an opt-in for this type of measurement. \n \nThe “cancel event” \n \nBeyond opt-in neurological measurement and eye-tracking measures for signaling actions and interest, we must consider other engagements beyond the click. Analytics companies like Nudge are measuring mouseover time   on desktop platforms. The equivalent to hover time on mobile would be placing your finger down on the screen and pulling it off without actually tapping through. This action, known as a “cancel event” in iOS, is not being tracked by advertisers, but could still signal intent and ad interaction. \n \nImproving the ecosystem \n \nBrands will continue to demand new measurement standards and technologies to better understand the role that impressions play in their digital ad spend. Digital publishers will benefit, as they will be able to c ommand premiums when ads that are simply seen and not “clicked” have a clear and proven benefit to the advertiser. And ultimately the consumer will always benefit from more relevant, less interruptive and more engaging advertising creative designed to enhance their experience. – Brandrepublic. \n \nChris Quigley
0512_9e4253e4-9c32-41ff-aafb-ec603a707c48	Dr. Richard Ruhling is an expert on Biblical prophecy and is the author of 'The Alpha & Omega Bible Code' \nWILMINGTON, NC, September 27, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- As millions speculate on whether they will be raptured or face the antichrist, it's ironic that he among us. The pope is not against Christ, but his claim to be the vicar of Christ puts him as a usurper in a place that only Christ can hold. He is also the enemy of America as Dr. Ruhling claims the evidence supports. \n\nDr. Richard Ruhling believes the pope comes with a plan that is as phony as a $3 bill. His social experiment has been tried for centuries in South America where his church has dominated governments since the time that America was also colonized and they have more natural resources than our western United States. Why are they so poor? A visit to Colombia and Venezuela in 1960 revealed half the people couldn't read or write and an excellent breeding ground for communism because of their poverty and ignorance. \n\nThe huge difference is that America was founded by Protestants fleeing the papal dominated Old World, risking their lives for freedom here. And they established a Constitution that was all about freedom that is anathema to Rome. Rome says "no man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true..." \n\nThe Syllabus of Errors, issued by Pope Pius IX, "condemns freedom of religion, conscience, speech, press, as it asserts the pope's temporal authority over all civil rulers." Rome downplays this for public relations, but the Syllabus of Errors is part of the ordination vows for priests worldwide. \n\nJesuits from the days of Lincoln have studied how to divide and conquer the US. Roman Catholic Chief Justice Tany said, "Negroes have no rights that the white man is bound to respect." They favored slavery and were behind the Ku Klux Klan. The pope was the only foreign entity to recognize Jefferson Davis as "Most Illustrious President" of the Confederate States. \n\nRome promoted Hitler and in the Axis Alliance they signed a concordat to support him in return for making the world Catholic when he won World War II. After losing, the United Nations was their best bet to regain lost supremacy in the Old World, aiming for a New World Order (Novus Ordo Seclorum on our $1 bill). \n\nRome represents everything America does not want or need except acceptance of our alternative lifestyles that their bad theology causes. Luther said, If there is a hell, Rome is built on it. Their claim to forgive sin (for a price) cheapens the death of Christ into no real repentance. In this sense the system is antichrist, in place of Christ who only can forgive sin. The pope's claim to be the vicar of Christ is best understood in Latin: Vicarius Filii Dei. It adds up to 666 in Roman numerals, which is the warning in Revelation 13:18. \n\nIf there is any question, Rome is described as a harlot riding the beast of New World Order in Revelation 17 where she commits fornication with kings--a church involved with politics, using and abusing government to punish heretic, she is "drunken with the blood of saints." She is decked in gold (wealthy) and scarlet (the color of cardinals), a Mother of Harlots (churches that no longer protest her) and sitting on seven hills. She is called Babylon (confused ideologies are okay, just ban protest as "hate speech," that is punishable). \n\nThis shouldn't be construed as hate against Catholic people, many of whom are sincere Christians doing the best that they know. In times of ignorance God winks, but in times of judgment (impending) we must repent (have a change of mind that goes deeper than money for a false system.) \n\nBefore America gets flushed down the toilet with an economic collapse that Rome is also capable of orchestrating, Ruhling asks that people pass this warning along. It could save others from the false worship of Lucifer (the angelic name of Satan before he became the devil) that's also done in the Vatican, a word that means "divining serpent." \n\nDr Richard Ruhling is author of "Alpha & Omega Bible Code", a book that has mostly 5-star reviews on Amazon and is also available on his website at http://thebridegroomcomes.com . \n\nDr. Richard Ruhling is a physician whose interest in retirement is Bible prophecy and alternative healthcare. More information on these and many other topics is offered on his site. \n\n--- \nPress release service and press release distribution provided by http://www.24-7pressrelease.com
0513_4ad27a47-5d5f-41a1-ac03-865fab51d042	SENECA FALLS — Liz Britton admits that motorcycles and a footrace make for an unlikely fundraising combination. \n  \nHowever, that unusual pairing — it’s being dubbed “Wheels and Heels” — is set for Saturday. It will raise money for the Sampson Veterans Memorial Cemetery and Operation Firing for Effect, the latter an advocacy group for veterans. \n \n“This is the first year we’ve tried anything like this, and we’re wondering if motorcycles and a 5K run really do go together,” said Britton, a Waterloo resident and one of the event’s organizers. “I guess we are going to find out.” \n \nWheels and Heels commences at Dewey’s Party House on Auburn Road. \n \nA roughly 100-mile motorcycle run starts at 11 a.m. and makes three stops before a ceremony at the cemetery, then returns to Dewey’s for dinner. Drivers will pay a $20 fee, which includes the meal cost. T-shirts will be sold. \n \nOrganizer Howard Blum said the motorcycle run will stop at the Arthur E. Bouton American Legion Post 770 in Trumansburg, the Montour Moose Lodge 426 and Arthur G. Depew Memorial VFW Post 6200 of Ovid before reaching the cemetery. \n \nThe course will depend on the number of riders, Blum added. \n \n“If the sun is shining, I expect anywhere from 50 to 100 bikes,” said Blum, a longtime biker who has organized a number of similar benefits in the past. “If we have a smaller number of riders, we will use a course with a few more curves and switchbacks. With more riders, it will be open roads.” \n \nThe second event is a Veterans Benefit 5K that begins and ends at Dewey’s and ends there. The prerace registration cost of $20 — it’s $30 on race day — also covers the postrace meal. The race starts at 5:30 p.m. \n \nTo register, visit www.veteransbenefitrun.racewire.com . \n \nThose interested in attending the dinner only can email Britton at veteranbenefitrun@gmail.com for more information. \n \nTwo bands, Pages Torn and AJ’s BraveHearts, will play at Dewey’s following the motorcycle run and 5K race. The latter includes former Genevan AJ Fratto, a 14-year Navy veteran and former crew chief for the Blue Angels, the Navy’s elite, flight-demonstration squadron. \n \nAll donations will be split 50-50 between the cemetery and OFFE. A number of sponsors have signed up, including Lyons National Bank, Accelerated Fitness, Penny’s Place, The Dog Shop, Rick Raker Electrical Contractor, Angel’s Custom Cycles, D&M Grocery and Max’s Custard. \n \nTo become a sponsor, contact Allison Britton at (315) 521-1796 or email Allison.britton@hotmail.com . \n \nLiz Britton, whose husband, father and father-in-law are war veterans, said co-organizers Blum, Sharon Stockman and Red Stahlman have been working hard to put a quality event together. The Patriot Guard and Legion Riders, two motorcycle groups who support veterans, are likely to have a number of people participating. \n \n“Howard, Sharon and Red are really special people who have a passion for helping veterans,” she said. \n \n“It’s going to be different and new. It is going to be a really interesting, collaborative group of people.”

0515_3d750294-1ee3-46a8-9760-11b1d7df1194	It's starting to feel like I've been away for a long, long time. That's always a good sign: it means that I'm actually resting. I love looking at the days left before returning to the real world and realizing that I can sit in this one spot for a while longer. We moved on to Stockholm on Wednesday. We had an early morning, followed by two flights and a couple of hours of wandering lost in the Stockholm public transport system before we arrived at our hotel. Planes might be fast, but I'm still hoping someone will invent a teleporter someday. Still, the journey had some highlights, like seeing this gigantic bar of Toblerone in the duty free shop in Heathrow Airport:\nI intended to knit while we traveled, but my brain would not allow it. Instead, I dozed. When I wasn't dozing, I read magazines: Runner's World, for when I return to real life and to the need to wear trousers that fit properly. Yes, I eat everything under the sun when I'm on vacation. No, I feel no guilt about it: And my other magazine: Practical Sheep, Goats, and Alpacas. I saw it in a bookstore in Belfast, and just had to bring it home. It's full of information for those who tend herds of fibre-bearing animals. It many come in handy some day. After all, it doesn't say "Frivolous Sheep, Goats, and Alpacas," right?\nAnyway, we arrived in Stockholm to Motel L, which is far more modern digs than we're accustomed to, but it's clean and comfortable, quiet and pleasant. It is all satisfyingly symmetrical, for a closet perfectionist like me:\nWe walked into Gamla Stan on Thursday, or the Old Town. It is as you would guess: old. We had no agenda, apart from exploring and enjoying the sunshine. I had bookmarked a couple of yarn shops on my phone, but wasn't particularly aiming for them. I was happy just to see what happened. We came across lots of old, beautiful buildings. I just bought a copy of Knitting Architecture, by Tanis Gray, which I love because I'm often inspired by buildings when I'm knitting. The buildings here will be fodder for many projects to come, I think:\nI loved the tight alleyways: And I saw a shop filled with the most amazing handmade treats:\nAnd we came across the most tightly packed shop of maritime collectables I'd ever seen. There was even a souvenir collection of letters from Swedish survivors of the Titanic. Given that the Titanic was built in Belfast, I thought that was a neat connection. I didn't buy a copy, but I might order it from them someday: And, purely by chance, we chose a path that brought us to two yarn stores. First was Sticka, which was a beautiful little shop: light and airy with a selection of yarns from the area. I bought this skein of BC Garn yarn from Denmark, which is just south of Sweden. I loved the thick and thin spin of it, and I've already started daydreaming about stitches that will show them off.\nThe second shop was called Anntorps Vav. When I entered, there were three woman chatting in there. One was someone I assumed was the owner, who was working on a beautiful sweater with what looked like some multicoloured handspun yarn. The sweater looked like Elizabeth Zimmerman's Adult Surprise Jacket (has it really come to the point that I'm recognizing patterns just by the look of them?). The other two woman were older, and one spoke to me in Swedish. When she could see I couldn't understand, she mimicked knitting motions with her hands, and I exclaimed, "Yes! I knit!" She nodded in approval and smiled. It was a nice moment. I walked away with a nameless yarn that was in a bin marked "Made in Sweden, 100% wool." The owner told me it was about 300m (about 320 yards), and it's a two-ply, coarse yarn in fingering weight. I think it will make a beautiful lace shawl, which should really hold its blocking. It was the only skein in this red colour. I tried to stay away from getting yet another red skein, but why resist? The next day, we took a boat tour through the city, and I took tons of photos of even more beautiful buildings: And then we left the central areas and entered the Ecopark:\nAnd even managed to get a photo of a ubiquitous boat dog: Today, we hung around in the area of the hotel. One of the most interesting things about Stockholm is that has the incredibly old juxtaposed next to the most incredibly modern, cutting edge stuff. The neighbourhood is an experiment in green architecture, with modern water recycling facilities, with roofs planted with grasses and fountains running with recycled water:\nAnd shops filled with the latest fashions, and hip, modern toys for all ages. The best toy I saw was this one, naturally:\nI also got to see a good friend of mine who I've known since before I finished university. We started out as "email penpals," and I'm amazed we've stayed in touch for this long. It was so, so nice to see him. It was lovely to just fall back into conversation, just as if we'd left off from one yesterday. It goes to show you how good friendships never wear out. We fly back tomorrow. I'm looking forward to being home in our own surroundings, but I'm grateful to have had the chance for a change in scenery and to visit with so many of my friends. It'll be another long plane journey, but I'm feeling rested and content. I'll have plenty of things to daydream about during the trip: fun conversations, future projects...  And of course, practical sheep. Always practical.

0518_c16f2c91-506c-4e94-bf0e-2da7732bbfe0	BALTIMORE — Rep. Elijah E. Cummings says he believes affordable health care for all Americans is an achievable goal, and cites President Obama’s signature law as a good start. \n\nAddressing an audience of hundreds of people Saturday at the Chase Brexton Charm Ball, the longtime Maryland Democrat said the “first step was the Affordable Care Act. We must be clear to not mistake a comma for a period.” \n\nThe ball — which also was attended by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, “Glee” star Kevin McHale and 300 guests — was a fundraiser to support the Chase Brexton Health Care Hardship Fund, which supplements health care coverage for those who cannot afford it. The event was held at the Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park in Baltimore. \n\nSEE ALSO: Family matters: A global snapshot inspired by Pope Francis \n\n“Universal health care is my goal,” said Mr. Cummings, who is rumored to be considering a run for the U.S. Senate. “It has been more than three decades since I first entered public life, and from the beginning, I have been inspired by all the people who [say] that affordable health care for everyone is a fundamental part of a civil society.” \n\nMr. Cummings pointed to medical advances that have assured that those even afflicted with HIV, once considered a veritable death sentence, are now living with “a manageable chronic condition.” \n\n“Thousands of our neighbors have survived and thrived as a result,” he said. \n\nSEE ALSO: HHS: Number insured under Obamacare swells to 17.6 million \n\nThe 10-term congressman received the group’s Leadership Award citing his ongoing work to bring about “universal health care in our lifetime.” \n\n“I will put this on my desk in Washington,” said Mr. Cummings, whose congressional district includes Baltimore. \n\nMr. McHale, who portrayed a paraplegic student in Fox-TV’s musical dramedy “Glee,” was bestowed the Man of Vision Award. \n\n“They’re helping people who really need it and may not be able to get it and afford it,” he said before receiving the award. “And it’s a nice idea to support an organization like that.” \n\nSinger-actress Connie Stevens was presented with the American Legend Award for her ongoing efforts to help out the neediest. Miss Stevens said she was particularly inspired by Pope Francis’ recent visit to the U.S. \n\n“I think it’s such a great change where people actually pay attention to [his message] and be more compassionate,” Miss Stevens said. \n\nActress CCH Pounder was given a lifetime achievement award for her advocacy on behalf of HIV/AIDS awareness, as well as her ongoing support for education in poorer African communities. Ms. Rawlings-Blake gave the trophy to the actress. \n\nThe final awardee of the event was singer/actress Thea Gill, who starred on Showtime’s “Queer as Folk.” Miss Gill was presented the Advocate Award for her ongoing campaign to raise awareness for LGBT issues.

0520_780e4cd2-8137-41d7-ad72-31b83c720134	Jeb Bush and John Kasich took a courageous stance on the Iran nuclear deal, breaking apart from the remaining candidates on the stage at the 2nd GOP presidential debate aired on CNN from the Ronald Reagan Library in California Wednesday night. \n \nTed Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Scott Walker reiterated previous commitments on derailing the international accord, that essentially already been approved by Congress. But in what may seem as going against the populist tone, Governor Bush and Kasich claimed that tearing up the deal on day one is not the wisest foreign policy approach, especially if Iran complies with the terms of the deal in the next 15 months or so. \n \n“It’s not a strategy to tear up an agreement,” said Bush. “A strategy would be how do we confront Iran? And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel’s back.” \n \nSenator Rand Paul, a Libertarian-Republican agreed with Bush. “Should we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That’s absurd,” he remarked. “Wouldn’t you want to know if they complied? Now, I’m going to vote against the agreement because I don’t think there’s significant leverage, but it doesn’t mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied.” \n \nOhio Governor Kasich, like Bush and Paul, declared he would not tear up the deal on day one, but further suggested that Cruz is playing to the crowd by vowing to unilaterally walk away from the deal after its implementation. “First of all, I think it’s a bad agreement, I would never have done it. But, you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don’t have the relationship with our allies,” he asserted. “We don’t know what’s going to happen in 18 months. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. I’ve seen lots of issues in foreign affairs, and foreign — in terms of global politics, you have to be steady.. We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I don’t think is the right policy.” \n \nBut at the same time, he promised to “rip up the deal” if Iran is caught cheating. “If they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on. And, if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon, then the military option is on the table,” Kasich pledged. “If we think they’re getting close to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information, you better believe that I would do everything in my power as the commander-in-chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon.” \n \nBut Cruz stood his ground, arguing that “if there’s anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, they’re giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief.” He contended that the U.S. will not know if and when Iran breaches the terms of the deal. “We won’t know under this agreement — there are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off limit altogether. Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence,” he stressed. “And most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever.” \n \nAdded Rubio: “Anyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply. There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan, and America as the great Satan…We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And I’ll tell you, I can’t wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.” \n \nWalker took credit for being “one of the first ones” to call for terminating the deal on day one. “The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up,” he said. \n \nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee wrapped up the debate by saying, “Iranians treat it like it’s toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.” \n \n

0522_00efe669-3aa0-4e15-88a0-29b8fe9c7ab7	Frank Water's writing day always began at seven each morning and lasted until around noon. "Then I'd go out and chop wood, run errands and in the evening I'd do my research reading." His trilogy research was confined to the mining industry and his books were peopled by his own family, his grandfather in particular. He was a lovable old character, "and not quite the crackpot I made him out to be."\nHis first six or seven manuscripts were written in ink on legal-size paper, then mailed to his sister to type. The routine had to change when he was asked to write a motion picture script for Hollywood in 1941, which necessitated the purchase of a typewriter. Waters learned to type with two to four fingers.\n"I still use the little portable Olivetti," he said, "and when that breaks down, I'm going to have to stop writing. I'm not mechanically-minded and I've never even owned an electric typewriter." A word processor? "I don't want one. They just confuse me."\nWhen asked whether characters or plots are more important, Waters said, "I never make up a blueprint because I found out that when you plot a book, like an architect who takes a plan of a house  he's going to build, and just adheres to it--if you plot a book and then sit down to write, there's nothing more to do. You've already done it. A story has an organic growth of its own, and you just have to let it flow at its own pace. I know about what I want, about where I'm going, but how to get there I don't know. So I just sit down and let it come.\n"I never sat down consciously to write a novel. It is so frightening. I'm just too scared to do that. You think of so many things. You've got to have a plot. Then you've got to have characters and you think of all the ones you've got to develop. Who's to be important and how will I do that, and then the  writing and the mood and the place. And all this is in your mind and it's just a frightening thing. So you sit down and say, 'Well, I can't pull all this stuff together, but I'll just write a few pages to see how it might go. And then you write a few more pages.'"\nWaters leaned back, his fingers drumming the table as he continued: "But the thing to guard against is when you sit down to do that first page over and over again so it will be perfect. And you think of all these things you want to articulate, so that it will be a good beginning. But you never get to the second page 'cause you want that first page so perfect. So you can't be afraid. You just have to jot down anything as it comes without worrying how it will sound until you get it all down--without worrying about punctuation. And then when you revise it, you use the other part of your brain, the analytical part. Then you can throw out a page or rewrite it."\nThe author never had a strict working schedule. He wrote until "the well is empty. I don't try to force it. I just leave it until the next day when the well will be filled up again."\nHis books required an average of two years to write and  he was never completely satisfied with them. He wasn't one to plunge in immediately into another book the moment the previous one was in the mail to his publisher. "I work so hard and long on a book, I'll just not do anything for a while. But I find out in a very short time that I feel lost without working on something, so various ideas start to pop up."\nSome writers enjoy writing. Waters found it "a chore, a real job, but you do get a little satisfaction and you feel good that you are in the creative process. It's confining and you're never free of it. It bugs you all the time. But I always try to forget it. That's the best thing to do. But I'll think I should have worked an hour later and carried on with "How will I do it?" I try to forget it, reminding myself that the well is dry."\nWaters stopped jotting down notes of inspiration after he'd had a few drinks because "everything looks so rosy and you rush to the desk to write down those beautiful lines and then you get up in the morning cold sober and see that it's rotten and has to be thrown away.\nHis first Hollywood scripting job was to write the screenplay from his novel River Lady for a producer named Selznick in 1941, which was then scrapped when Pearl Harbor was bombed that year. The motion picture was to star Clark Gable, but was later produced starring Dan Duryea and without Waters. In 1956 he was commissioned by C.V. Pitney pictures to write the development of the American Space Flight Program, which evolved into the history of transportation.\n"I went back to the first transport vehicle in American history--those big wagon trains though the Cumberland Mountains, then into covered wagons across the great plains, and the Studebaker wagons and Studebaker cars, and so on."\nWaters and  his fourth wife Barbara traveled to Mexico, Central and South America for research. "I like the people," he said, "the Indians and the Spanish. It's an old land with the feeling of richness that we don't have here." The Waters lived in Taos, New Medico, during the warm months and in Tucson during the winter. The author lived in the mountains above Taos for more than forty years and made friends among the Pueblo Indians and descendants of Spanish conquistadors. His friend White Bear was instrumental in having the author adopted in his tribe's Coyote Clan, an unusual occurrence because Native Americans guard their ancient secrets from outsiders. The ceremonials of the kiva and other traditional customs are neglected because of social and economic pressures as well. "The kids want what white kids have and they leave the reservations to get jobs. They don't want to stay and grow corn in the old ways."\n Mystery reading was his favorite pastime, but he only published one of his own, based on an old murder case involving some of his Taos neighbors. "You've got to have a good tight plot and I just couldn't concoct a detective story to save myself--planting clues and all that. I've got two or three favorite authors and one of my favorite series is about a detective named Napoleon Bonaparte, a half-breed--half white, half aboriginal--in Australia's outback. They're all fabulous stories, written some fifty years ago with some of the old aboriginal religious customs and mental telepathy, the same as the Indians in this country. They're just now beginning to be published in England and the U.S. If you can find them, they're worth reading."\nFrank Waters was also fascinated by the Mexican border region during  his eighteen-month stay in Calexico during prohibition. "It was an interesting place in turmoil, the meeting ground of the Mexican and American cultures, and it epitomized the difference between the blending of the two."

She’s also received numerous e-mails and texts. Some just say, “Way to go.” Others say, “Show me how I can help.” \n \nAll were reacting to a Greenwich Time article illustrating her role in helping Brandy, Daniel and their son, a homeless family panhandling in Greenwich. Her friends and family had shared it on social media and others had gotten her contact information from friends of friends. \n \nBut now that she knew people cared, Gwozdz was struggling with the next step: How could she unite everyone together to help? \n \n“It was pretty overwhelming. I literally got a notebook out writing down people’s names because I wanted to make sure I to get back to them,” she said. \n \nAfter taking suggestions, Gwozdz turned to the Internet and found her solution. \n \nOn Sept. 22 at 11:27 a.m. a crowdfunding account on Fundly, titled “Lift them up” went live. Gwozdz, who created a separate checking account for the fund, said the money will go toward the family’s first month’s rent, which they need to pay in order to move in to an apartment Brandy has found, and toward their immediate needs after the move. \n \n“My goal is to get them on their feet,” said Gwozdz. \n \nWithin 24 hours, the Fundly account had raised $660. \n \n“It’s amazing the effect that the story had on this community,” said Brandy. “When (Gwozdz) told me that, didn’t even say a dollar amount, my only response to her was just, ‘Wow.’” \n \nThe Greenwich Bank & Trust in Glenville plans to stock the family’s fridge once they move into their new home. \n \n“It just goes to show you that there’s good people in the world and they all want to help. Sometimes people just don’t know how to help. Sometimes you have to set it up for them and then people will just jump on it,” said Gwozdz. \n \nBrandy said she was humbled by the outpouring of care. \n \n“You always hear that nobody cares about your sad story, that everyone has a sad story. I told Daniel ‘Nobody is going to care. There are homeless people all over the world. We’re not special, we just fell into this.’ But I feel honored to be a part of something that I myself would never have cared about before,” she said. \n \nBrandy said she used to drive by homeless people on her way to work in California without a second thought. \n \n“It’s been amazing that people have responded the way that they have. And have given freely, from their heart,” she said. \n \nThough Brandy is grateful for the platform, she said the idea of taking the money makes her cringe a little. \n \n“I’m appreciative of all the wonderful people that cared enough, but I’m just dealing with this ugly pride of mine,” she said. “There’s something different about accepting a towel and linens from a little old woman on the street (and getting money from strangers through a website).” \n \nBrandy’s family has been helped by many people since their plight was first publicized in an initial article earlier this month. But, while grateful, Brandy said she also is uncomfortable with being the town’s charity case. \n \n“I feel like a failure in a way,” she said, but added she can’t let low self-esteem get in the way of what needs to be done, finding her husband and son a home. \n \nMonetary donations for Brandy, Daniel and their son can be made at: https://fundly.com/lift-them-up . \n  \nSFoster-Frau@scni.com; @SilviaElenaFF

Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra Stephen Parker is resigning after nine years in the top job. Professor Parker is making the announcement today, but will remain in the position until July, in order to give the university time to find a replacement.\n\nProfessor Parker has overseen the largest growth and reform of the University of Canberra during his terms – just last month succeeding in securing a variation on the Territory Plan to allow the UC to proceed with a $1 billion campus redevelopment.\n\nWhen Professor Parker first took up the Vice-Chancellorship in 2007, he inherited a $16 million deficit.\n\nProfessor Parker said his decision to leave was based on the fact he had achieved his broad vision for the university.\n\n"Now it is up to someone new to come in and do it their way."\n\nHe categorically stated he had no other job lined up and was planning on relocating to Melbourne to spend time with his wife, three daughters and 18-month old grandson – who were all based there.\n\n"I look forward to catching up on reading, perhaps doing some teaching, and I would be very happy to continue my research in access to justice."\n\nProfessor Parker recently advocated a HECS-like loans scheme to improve access to justice, which he would like to develop further.\n\n"It is just time to move on, after nine years."\n\nThis week, the UC placed 25th in Australian universities ranked in the QS World University Rankings – jumping into the 551-600 category with an improvement of 100 places.\n\n"We must remember UC has only been a university for 25 years and is one of the smallest in the country. We have never had any special funding for research, we have had to find it all ourselves and our rising research record is driving this improvement."\n\nSince 2007, student numbers have increased under Professor Parker from 10,756 to over 17,100 this year. Academic staff numbers have risen from 339 to over 450 while total staff numbers, have risen from 869 to over 1000.\n\nOverseas student numbers – a lucrative source of funding for UC – have risen from 2457 in 2007 to over 4000 this year.\n\nTo accommodate them, UC has built 1500 new bedrooms in student residences.\n\nProfessor Parker was particularly focussed on improving the university's think-tank capacity – instituting the UC Research Institute in Sport and Exercise (UC RISE) and the Health Research Institute.\n\nIn 2013, Professor Parker and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr – then Sports Minister – turned the first sod on the $16 million sporting commons and new home for the ACT Brumbies – paving the way for the UC to begin operations as a sports science centre of excellence.\n\nIn July, UC staff were part of a national first when they received their inaugural dividend of part of the UC's surplus.\n\nThe Employee Bonus Scheme distributed a pool of money among employees after reached a surplus of $5.87 million after adjusting for one-off items.\n\nA total pool of $1,034,531 was divvied up amongst 840 eligible permanent employees who received up to $1,133.97, based on their full-time equivalence.

Just going on the road, your thoughts on this team and its ability to be successful away from home?\n\nMatthias Farley: Yeah, every time we go on the road, it's exciting. You go into a hostile environment -- I think it will be an incredible atmosphere. It's going to be our first road game and going to be a challenge to weather the travel and all that kind of stuff. We're all really eager and I think we're going to have success wherever we play.\n\nQ. You guys have not won a true road game at an opponent's home field since Air Force in 2013, five straight losses. Why do you think that was and why do you think this team is different from falling into that?\n\nMatthias Farley: I think this team is different because it's a different team, it's a different mind-set, it's a different year. I think you ask every guy on the team, no one is focusing on anything in the past. We are focusing on one day at a time, one step at a time and moving forward this we're.\n\nQ. What makes the road game difficult?\n\nMatthias Farley: Besides that it's a road game -- there's a hostile environment but it also makes it exciting because it's a change of pace. You're the best friends in the world, but you experience other things and like I said, being in a hostile environment where you have to bring your A Game.\n\nQ. A lot of talk last year about communication among the defense, after reviewing the film on Saturday, how much better was communication with the defense?\n\nMatthias Farley: I think the communication was awesome. I mean, obviously the first game, there's always going to be room for improvement but for a first outing, I think everyone communicated really well. Guys got the checks, really signaled things well when it got loud, which it did with our fans getting really loud.\n\nSo I think for the first game of the season, you know, and the second year in this new system, I think our guys did an incredible job, especially (indiscernible) -- from last year, just a communication standpoint between the first game last year and first game this year is night and day.\n\nQ. During the off-season, what things allowed you to improve communication besides just reps?\n\nMatthias Farley: Well, in the off-season we have, you know, like players-only kind of things, like seven-on-sevens and things in off-season where communication is really ran by us.\n\nWe have to keep that standard of communication that we have when the coaches are around. So building that bond when the coaches aren't around and just doing things together that aren't necessarily on the field, watching film together and seeing things quicker in the film room and having that translate out on the field.\n\nQ. On special teams, the new buy-in this year, can you talk about how that was initiated, were you getting some real front line guys? I know guys like you have been there throughout your career, but it seems that a lot of front line guys are now involved in the run team.\n\nMatthias Farley: Well, I think the whole mind-set of things has changed with this team this year. And the focus, it's always been a huge focus for the coaches, but I think this is a year where guys saw last year and the year before where special teams have huge impacts on games.\n\nAnd there can be hidden yardage where you never see it, you don't see the play. It's not like a forced fumble on a kickoff or anything like that. But there's field position battles that happen with every kick or change of possession.\n\nSo I think guys understanding that, understanding how much of an impact it has on offense and defense has caused everyone to buy in. I think everyone in years past has bought in, but I think this year it's a little different in the focus that people have.\n\nQ. Even guys like Russell -- something we wouldn't see from the starting cornerback. Do you see him asking, I want to be part of this?\n\nMatthias Farley: Absolutely. Guys want to be, and especially on kickoff, it's a huge thing. Everybody wants to be on there, you go a hundred miles in practice and guys are asking. I think in past years, can I not do this if I'm playing 90 snaps or whatever it may be. But guys really, really want to be in all phases of the game.\n\nQ. You're similar in that when you were recruited more as an athlete and figure it out once you get here. Curious what that's like to go through as a process when you're committing and signing with a school that you don't really know what position you're going to play?\n\nMatthias Farley: I think it just comes down to trusting the coaches and understanding that they know a lot more about the game than you do and they have seen a lot more of the game than you have.\n\nYou come out of high school, I'm sure a lot of guys think they are set in their ways and think, oh, I'm the best at this and best at that. I think especially our coaches, they are identifying, you might be a better fit here, you might be a better fit there. And it's not necessarily the first try it works out perfectly. Obviously he (ph) came in as a safety, played receiver and now he's playing running back and having success. I think just trusting the coaches and understanding that they are going to put you in the best position to maximize your potential.\n\nQ. Red-shirted as a safety and moved to offense, you were reversed. When that happens when they move you over after red-shirt years, how do you react to that and are you sort of like, well, what did I just spend the last nine months on to move at this point. How does a player deal with that?\n\nMatthias Farley: It's definitely an adjustment, especially I was on scout team, so it wasn't like I was learning a whole bunch of like week-in and week-out offense. So I think that kind of helped I guess in some ways because I didn't learn a whole bunch of that to start from zero.\n\nBut it's definitely an adjustment. You have people around you that think, like, oh, you're a wide receiver, but no, you're not. Or you go to your first meeting in the oppositions room, like you're a safety and now you're playing receiver, it's kind of weird. Like I said, it goes back to trust and understanding that the coaches are going to put you in the best position.\n\nQ. You've had to tackle a lot of different styles of running backs whether it be in practice or game. Prosise, how would you describe his running style, just trying to deal with it?\n\nMatthias Farley: I mean, I think he's very unique in his running style because he's so big. He's like 220 pounds. He doesn't really look that big. He walks around, he doesn't look that big, but when you see him in practice, you're like, you're a large individual.\n\nHe's really, really shifty, which I don't think we got to see too much of when he was at wide receiver because he runs around, catch the ball. But now you get the ball in his hands early and be able to make plays and make people miss. Obviously he's incredibly fast.\n\nSo you can't just -- he's not a power guy but he can run powerfully. He's not like an I'm-going-to-make-you-miss-guy but he could easily make you miss. He has a lot of things that he brings to the table that make it difficult to bring him down.\n\nQ. Obviously you have a lot of young guys playing on both sides of the ball. Have you had to kind of give them any advice on what a true road game is going to be like, or is that advice even necessary with this young group?\n\nMatthias Farley: I don't think it's really necessary. I think everyone really understands the situation we're facing. Any time you go into someone else's environment that it's going to be hostile, just understand that you can gain, instead of letting it take away from you. I think all the older guys, all the younger guys are very excited.\n\nQ. Coach Kelly talked about how they have some big receivers and long receivers. From a secondary standpoint, does that change your preparation, or does that change any of your preparations at all?\n\nMatthias Farley: Doesn't really change our preparation. We have got Corey Robinson, we have Equanimeous, we have Allen, always had big guys to go against in practice. So I think we'll be well prepared, especially on the perimeter, those guys who go against long-range receivers week-in and week-out.\n\nQ. Curious how you guys watched the Virginia-UCLA game. Do you DVR it? Is it strictly watching film in the coaches?\n\nMatthias Farley: So, yeah, so we watched just the film. We don't watch the TV version because you can only see so much with that. And then there will be the same things we watch with the coaches, but also the CBs will get together, the DBs will get together and watch it in our own time or come in with the linebackers and see how different checks will be made, different things.\n\nQ. Just how you felt on Saturday night, you're probably a little apprehensive when the game starts. But was it comfortable on defense, and just knowing KeiVarae is back there and a couple of the guys are back that, okay, we are in a rhythm and things are working out for us?\n\nMatthias Farley: Yeah, I don't think there's any real nerves that much. I think everyone is just really eager. We've been going against each other forever now it seems like, so to be able to go out and have all your hard work put on display and see guys playing around, obviously we mentioned before the communication; that people understand and really clicking. I think people are more comfortable in the new system and just guys being 100 percent bought in.\n\nQ. I've heard the word "vision" a lot. I've seen #vision, and every now and then it pops up. Where does it come from and is that something that the team is really rallying around?\n\nMatthias Farley: Yeah, in order to have success you have to have a vision. And to attain that vision, you have to work towards it every day and keep it in the forefront and not let your eyes go here or not go there. You have a mind-set or someplace and you try to refocus on that. And the team, we know where we want to be at the end of the season. And that's our vision, that's our focus and that's what we focus on every day.\n\nQ. Is that written or do you say it?\n\nMatthias Farley: It's a known thing.\n\nQ. Obviously you have an experienced secondary, but when you look at Elijah Shumate, you guys have been together for a while. How have you seen him grow and develop to where he is now in his role?
0529_e65a5728-c5a7-436a-99da-c6aab37422e0	Unkind types have suggested that our former treasurer, Joe Hockey, had trouble getting his head around anything more complicated than a T-bone steak.\n\nSo CBD was interested to see a contrarian view from someone with serious credentials on the financial front. Unkind types have suggested that our former treasurer, Joe Hockey, had trouble getting his head around anything more complicated than a T-bone steak. So CBD was interested to see a contrarian view from someone with serious credentials on the financial front. Respected fundie John Hempton of Bronte Capital recently blogged on his time as a Treasury mandarin, dealing with Hockey the MiniRAT.\n\nFor the uninitiated, that's a technical reference to Hockey's previous role as Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer – rather than the cigar-smoking leftie who opposed the imposition of a $250 fee on his free education.\n\n"When I was at the Treasury we had several MiniRATs, some of whom were unimpressive. However I had a bit to do with Joe Hockey when he was MiniRAT and found that he was enormously quick at getting across the brief. He did not always agree with the Treasury advice but he was able to enunciate the issues. He asked exactly the right questions – and sometimes questions we had not thought through ourselves," said Hempton.\n\n"Joe had the bandwidth. I mean really properly. Joe was sharp," he added without a hint of sarcasm.\n\n"I hoped for and expected a better end to Joe's career," said Hempton, whose views hold particular interest for another reason.\n\nHempton's local MP, Malcolm Turnbull, has parked some of his squillions in a Bronte Capital fund and obviously rates Hempton's views.\n\nSome of them at any rate. Papal Fiat\n\nSpeaking of Turnbull, our new PM has been dethroned as the coolest thing in a Fiat 500.\n\nPope Francis decided to put his environmental credentials on display during his current US visit.\n\nAfter a red-carpet welcome by President Barack Obama, the Pope climbed into the back of a small black Fiat 500L. No easy feat for a 78-year-old.\n\nUS reports state that the Fiat 500 gets an average 27 miles per gallon "in unarmoured versions".\n\nCBD never thought to ask if Turnbull's fire-engine red chariot includes the armoured option, which may have been handy given the events of the last week. Banana drama \n\nThe kaleidoscopically colourful mining minnow Indochine Ltd may have succumbed to the corporate paramedics earlier this year, but it is still providing plenty of entertainment.\n\nIt has just lost a multimillion-dollar court judgment to its former executive chairman, Robert Coghill, over his unceremonious dumping from the company just before a $115 million public float of the business in 2010.\n\nIndochine was not represented in court during the trial earlier this month and the judgment came down in favour of Coghill, who was awarded $US2.65 million in damages for breach of his employment contract.\n\nTwo of the executives closely involved in the Coghill drama are well know to CBD.\n\nDavid Evans and Jeremy Snaith are the dynamic duo enshrined in Melbourne Mining Club folklore as the "Bananas in Pyjamas" following a certain Etihad flight in 2007.\n\nThe boys, who were working for Jupiter Mines at the time, were arrested after alleged inappropriate antics on a flight to Abu Dhabi for the mining explorer.\n\nBoth received suspended sentences although Snaith spent 25 days in Al Wathba prison.\n\nSoon after, they both left to develop Indochine, but left around the time of the float. Cash call\n\nCash Converters' new chairman, former Bank of Queensland boss Stuart Grimshaw, will have a delicate task to perform at the upcoming AGM.\n\nIt is not the best time for Grimshaw to seek permission to create a bit more headroom on the pay front to accommodate the talent being brought on board.\n\nInvestors gave the company a first strike against its remuneration report last year – and remember that was before the company went under the spotlight over its business practices and faced class actions.\n\nWe still don't know what new CEO Mark Reid will be earning. But he has just watched a $15.5 million pay day slip through his hands when Greenstone Financial Services failed to float, so Reid won't come cheap.\n\nWhat we do know is that beefing up the board will also require a lift in the directors' fee pool from $490,00 to $800,000.\n\nIt should be as easy as getting one of the cash advances that the company is famous for. Excess baggage\n\nThe remuneration of Virgin boss John Borghetti might have lost a bit of altitude last year, but at least he will have a lot less baggage to deal with at board meetings.\n\nThe CEO of Richard Branson's Virgin mothership, Joshua Bayliss, stepped down from the Virgin board on Wednesday, which leaves Borghetti with one fewer backseat drivers offering tips on how to fly his corporate plane.\n\nHe is left with Air New Zealand boss Chris Luxon, who is never short of an opinion. And Singapore Airlines boss Choon Phong Goh, who probably considers himself pretty handy at this business as well.\n\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0530_dedf296c-2606-438f-ba24-8b1734660c6f	Just the Facts, Ma'am: The Liberty went ice cold from the field and the Fever rose to the occasion, as Indiana topped New York 66-51 to take the Eastern Conference Finals 2-1 and advance to the WNBA Finals. Marissa Coleman canned five treys to lead Indiana with 15 points. Tamika Catchings had 14, Erlana Larkins 12 with eight rebounds, and Briann January added eight points, six steals, and eight assists. Candice Wiggins had 15 off the bench to lead New York; Tina Charles had 13 points and 10 rebounds.\nFor classless behavior, frustration, bitterness, rage, exhaustion, blame-slinging, Greek tragedy, and superficial basketball analysis, join your intrepid blogger after the jump.\nI refuse to entertain the possibility that this is the end. I can't go into the game with this mindset. No worries. No fears. No doubts. No hesitation. Can't bring those vibes.\nIt's been a bear of a day. Stressful and intense. Left my jersey and my hat at home, so the faithful husband had to bring them. Left my phone and my keys at the office to make the bus. This isn't helping.\nTina Charles is burning bright. Everyone else looks like dead coals. I don't know what's wrong with Piph, but it worries me. We're missing shots my high school team could make. Indiana is outplaying us, and it's not like we're making it easy on defense.\nI rather question how Indiana had 4 fouls with 6:17 left in the second quarter and ended the second quarter with four team fouls. But the officials aren't yet worthy of blame in this game. We're bringing it on ourselves.\nBut I have to believe. What else can I do? This is my team. I ride or die with them. This is summer. My loyalties are not split. I don't have a fallback plan.\nRight now, I honestly don't know what's more frustrating, the Liberty's ice cold shooting or the number of people standing in the aisles because the ushers can't be arsed to usher people to their seats and get the GA tickets out of already claimed seats. Today has been a hot mess of late-arriving large groups clustered in the aisles.\nThis had all the fixings of a magical night. The place is packed. Spike Lee showed up, at least ofr the first half. Knicks legends are all over the place: the Pearl, Clyde, Starks. The towels are waving. The fans are psyched.\n...and historically, that's when post-2002 Liberty teams most often lay an egg, oh crap.\nIt sounds selfish to say this hasn't been my day, but this really hasn't been my day. This doesn't help. This was supposed to be coronation. This was supposed to be catharsis. This was supposed to be exorcism, supposed to be the link between the first and the last. Instead, the ghosts came back hungrier than ever, bigger than ever, cold and cruel and taunting.\nHamartia, the tragic flaw that brings down the hero in Greek theater: Piph's shooting, Tanisha's hesitation, Kiah's youth, Carolyn's knee, Essence's body, Sugar's impetuousness, Bill's nonchalance.\n23 wins and homecourt are ashes and dust now. There's no advantage when you're not playing. Does the regular season mean nothing? No, it doesn't. This was a hell of a year and a hell of a team. But it's tainted now, overshadowed by the choke in Game 2 and the blown chances in Game 3, forever haunted by all that was supposed to be and all that could have been.\nIf Piph shot like the superstar she was...\nIf Tanisha drove instead of dribbling on the perimeter...\nIf we could hit our free throws...\nIf Kiah hit the bunnies...\nBut as a fan, and as one admittedly overinvested in the rise and fall of my team, there's a tiny voice in my head. If you had remembered your jersey… if you had worn the black on black like you did for Game 1... if you'd played through the playlist... if you'd done all the things you did when we won...\nIt's only weird if it doesn't work. Or maybe it's only not weird when it doesn't work.\nAll right. Time to breathe around this tension in my chest. I'm really hoping it's just my bra.\nBoth coaches emptied the bench at the very end, so Maggie Lucas and Jeanette Pohlen got a minute at the end of the game. Layshia Clarendon got a couple of minutes in the first quarter but was not terribly effective, so she went back to the bench until it was time for the victory formation. I miss the gold in her hair- you lose the headband without that contrast against it. Shavonte Zellous was aggressive offensively and generally seemed to be annoying people. She's good at that. Her emotions are a large part of her game, for both good and for ill.\nNatasha Howard got some early minutes, but she showed in those minutes that the mental portion of her game hasn't necessarily caught up to her physical gifts. Lynetta Kizer was sorely missed by Indiana in that first game- she stretched the offense and brought physicality on defense. She's one of the most underappreciated players on this Fever roster, and that's saying something.\nBriann January was tenacious on defense, fell down with style a lot, and sealed the deal with two late baskets, including one utterly ridiculous reverse lay-up late in the game that might as well have been the equivalent of ripping out our beating hearts and holding them up as sacrifice to the gods. (It's quarter to one, I'm slightly loopy and having a lot of trouble forcing myself to write these notes. If you're expecting brilliant commentary, go read Mechelle Voepel.) She chased down loose balls all over the court and read our offense better than most of our players did. Shenise Johnson and her giant hair did more work inside than out today, which I don't think we were expecting. Marissa Coleman shot the lights out from outside, because apparently we don't learn from our mistakes and don't understand that leaving Marissa Coleman open is a rather unintelligent thing to do. Any chance we had of getting our act together was shot down, and I mean that with a fair amount of literalism, when she got loose beyond the arc. Her height was a help defensively as well.\nErlana Larkins brought the physicality and set wicked screens for her teammates. She made sure the Liberty did not have good rebounding position, and she made baskets in the second half by taking advantage of open space. Tamika Catchings did Tamika Catchings things, but seemed to be hitting the deck more than usual and less of her own volition. She was the star, and she did her job, but she didn't carry her team except perhaps spiritually. She didn't have to. Gosh, that would be nice.\n(Yes, I'm bitter like a mouthful of lemon and a spoonful of cinnamon. Next question?)\nErica Wheeler got a moment in the waning minutes and missed a shot over the basket, one of many Liberty players to do so. Sugar Rodgers was guarded closely enough that she couldn't get the looks she was getting earlier in the series, and she wasn't ready for it. (The petty, bitterest, part of me is all like you weren't familiar with that when you were Georgetown? ) She had shots. She missed. She fumbled. She made careless plays on the sideline. This was the Rodgers that Minnesota gave away for, ultimately, literally, nothing. Candice Wiggins played like her life was on the line. I question some of her shot selections, but she at least took the shots. She at least stepped up and brought fire to the court. That's more than I can say for most of her teammates.\nEssence Carson hit one big shot and one smaller shot that might have been bigger if her foot had not been on the line. But she barely contributed defensively, and she made stupid mistakes with the ball. Kiah Stokes played like a rookie, and like the rookie she was projected to be when she was at UConn instead of the rookie she played like all season. She was late on defensive rotations, she was soft on the glass, she missed bunnies in the lane. We needed her to be rock-solid, and she crumbled.\nOur starting backcourt might have been the biggest disappointment of the night, in a night that was full of them. Epiphanny Prince couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. There was a point in the game where she genuinely looked glazed over, like she was attempting to retreat to her happy place but she kept getting distracted. She pulled herself together briefly in the third quarter, but a combination of defense and... you know what, I can't even sugar-coat that bad shooting. When a slick shooter like Piph goes 1-4 from the free throw line, there's something wrong with the player on that particular night. But she's not even the starting Liberty guard I'm most disappointed in. Piph, for all her failures as a scorer, at least rebounded, defended, passed. Tanisha Wright? One of our veteran leaders? One of the players who's supposed to be at the forefront of the defense and the general of the offense? She checked out sometime in the second quarter. Her head left the game and never really came back. No way you're winning a game with a player in that mental condition. She strangled the offense with endless dribbling and made some truly dumb passes. It got to the point where Piph was playing point and Tanisha was pretending to be the shooting guard.\nTina Charles can't do it alone. We've seen how that ends. It usually ends with Tina flouncing (which, see below). She had a double-double midway through the third quarter. But Indiana doubled her constantly, or sent Tamika Catchings (AKA the woman DPOY should be named after someday) at her, or did both. And she had to guard Catch at the other end. She's only human. She faltered in the fourth. Someone should have been there to catch her. Swin Cash did her best. At least she hustled and went to the basket, but we shouldn't have had to ask that of someone who's thirty-mumble and has knee issues. I thought she should have been the defender on Catchings, but surprise. Carolyn Swords was ineffective. She fell down more than usual. She had good looks at the basket and missed. Again, story of our lives.\nBill all but pulled a Nancy Darsch in the fourth quarter, when we were still within range, taking out the hot hands and putting the starters back in. At which point everything went to hell in a handbasket, and by the time we hit the final five it was all over but the crying. (Yes, I cried. Judge me and I will hurt you with pain.)\nI'd like to blame the officials, because Michael Price and Roy Gulbeyan are such good targets, but we did this to ourselves.\nEven all of this might have been tolerable were it not for the endless seething frustration I spent the night stewing in. We saw an usher for the first time sometime after halftime, after we had missed probably five minutes' worth of game time due to people standing in the aisles and arguing over seats. There was almost a fight two rows in front of us that I still don't know the story behind. And the woman behind us was intolerable. Look, I love fans being loud. I'm one of them. You wanna yell at everyone and anyone on the court? I'm okay with that. But I draw the line at profanity at games, especially when there are children around, and there were two schoolgirls in the row in front of us. The woman behind us persisted in shrieking profanities at the top of her lungs in a shrill, carrying voice that probably killed untold cilia in my ears, even after we asked her to please stop swearing.\nAnd then Tina decided that everyone else had disappointed us (except Candice), so why shouldn't she join the fun? As soon as the game was over, she tried to bolt for the locker room without shaking hands or anything. Swin was not having with that. I saw the play as it was in the midst of developing, so the first thing I saw was Swin sprinting full speed for the tunnel, and I thought she was the one frustrated and wanting to get away from everything. Then I saw her corral Tina and haul her back to the court to shake hands. Well done by Swin and disappointing by Tina. I understand the urge to get away from the scene and either go cry or go punch things, but if you're a professional, you need to paste on a smile for an extra few minutes before you go vent.\nOn the plus side, the organist is definitely ready for Rangers season. Me? I'm not ready for more basketball yet. I'm taking a break this weekend. I don't care about the Finals- I don't have a dog in the race and there isn't anyone on either team who I care about getting a ring.\nPetty? Yeah. Fucks given? Zero.

0532_8dd31130-8c31-4ca0-9c4a-402364f5f2bd	NEW YORK — The latest on the U.S. Open (all times local):\n\n5:05 p.m.\n\nSerena Williams' bid for a true Grand Slam is safe, despite an uneven performance in the U.S. Open's second round.\n\nOvercoming 10 double-faults and two dozen other unforced errors, Williams emerged with a 7-6 (5), 6-3 victory over 110th-ranked qualifier Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nWilliams got broken to fall behind 2-1 early, and Bertens served for the opening set at 5-4 before getting broken for the first time.\n\nThen in the tiebreaker, Williams trailed 4-0, before turning things around, helped by shaky play from Bertens, who only once has made it to the third round at a major tournament in 14 appearances.\n\nWilliams has won the past four major titles, a streak that began at last year's U.S. Open, and is trying to complete the first calendar-year Grand Slam since Steffi Graf in 1988.\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nSerena Williams got off to a rough start in her second-round U.S. Open match, before pulling out the opening set in a tiebreaker against Kiki Bertens, a qualifier from the Netherlands ranked 110th.\n\nWilliams, bidding for tennis' first true Grand Slam since Steffi Graf in 1988, got broken by Bertens to trail 2-1, then was down 5-4. But with Bertens serving for the opening set, Williams earned her first break point of the match and converted it.\n\nThen in the tiebreaker, Williams fell behind 4-0, only to turn things around to grab that first set 7-6 (5).\n\nWilliams began the second set better, just breaking to go ahead 2-1.\n\n4 p.m.\n\nBethanie Mattek-Sands has finally reached the third round at her home Grand Slam tournament in her 13th try.\n\nThe 101st-ranked American routed countrywoman CoCo Vandeweghe 6-2, 6-1 on Wednesday at the U.S. Open. It was an especially impressive performance considering the 45th-ranked Vandeweghe was coming off a breakthrough run to the Wimbledon quarterfinals and upset 29th-seeded Sloane Stephens in the first round.\n\nThe 30-year-old Mattek-Sands, who got in with a wild card, had been 0-5 in U.S. Open second-round matches.\n\n"You know what? Thirty is the new 21," she said in an on-court interview.\n\nBest known for her colorful fashion statements and doubles accomplishments, Mattek-Sands will get more time to focus on her singles run here. She and Lucie Safarova were seeded second after winning the Australian and French Opens this year, but Safarova had to pull out because of a strained abdominal muscle. Mattek-Sands' next opponent could be Serena Williams.\n\nIt was a disheartening end to the summer for Vandeweghe. After she fell behind 5-0 in the first set, she smashed her racket on her chair, then cracked it on the court three more times. Finally, Vandeweghe raised her arms to the crowd and slammed it once more.\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nDefending champion Marin Cilic is taking a quick and quiet trip through this year's U.S. Open draw so far.\n\nThe ninth-seeded Cilic, whose only appearance in a Grand Slam final came at Flushing Meadows in 2014, reached the third round by beating Evgeny Donskoy of Russia 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 on Wednesday.\n\nCilic has won all six sets he's played this week.\n\n2:40 p.m.:\n\nMardy Fish and Feliciano Lopez are both 33 and have now played each other nine times.\n\nLopez paid tribute to his American counterpart after beating him in the last match of Fish's career Wednesday at the U.S. Open.\n\nFish had a chance to serve out the match in the fourth set, then was hobbled by severe leg cramps in the fifth as Lopez finally eked out the victory.\n\n"I was lucky that I won the fourth set," the 18th-seeded Lopez said in an on-court interview. "And then in the fifth set, he was not feeling well. He was cramping and he was so tired. I think he really deserved the win today."\n\nFish returned to the tour this summer after struggling with anxiety disorder and announced the U.S. Open would be the final tournament of his career.\n\n"It's been many years together. ... We played many times. He beat me a couple times," Lopez said. "I have to say, he was the better player, normally, when we played. And he was a great player, had a good career. It was very sad what was happening the last two, three years with this illness, and it's great to have him back at least for a few weeks."\n\n2:30 p.m.:\n\nMardy Fish's career ended with his legs cramping badly in a fifth set at the U.S. Open.\n\nThe 33-year-old American had a chance to serve out an upset of 18th-seeded Feliciano Lopez in the fourth set of their second-round match Wednesday, but nerves took over. He had three straight unforced errors then double-faulted to be broken at love, and Lopez quickly won the next two games as well to force the deciding set.\n\nFish, whose career was derailed by anxiety disorder, hung in there in the fifth on a hot, humid day, but his legs were clearly cramping more and more and he was able to move less and less. Finally when he was serving at 3-4, his leg seized up in the middle of a point. Lopez, who was dealing with nerves of his own in the final set, broke then closed out the 2-6, 6-3, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory after 3 hours, 11 minutes.\n\nFish, a former top-10 player, decided to end his career here to try to make some new memories at Flushing Meadows. In 2012, what should have been one of his best moments turned into the worst, when he withdrew because of a panic attack before his fourth-round match against Roger Federer.\n\n12:40 p.m.:\n\nDaria Kasatkina is a lucky winner.\n\nThe 133rd-ranked Russian teen lost in U.S. Open qualifying Friday, but when third-seeded Maria Sharapova withdrew Sunday because of an injury, Kasatkina was suddenly in her first Grand Slam main draw as a "lucky loser."\n\nShe proceeded to upset 38th-ranked Daria Gavrilova in the first round the next day, then won again Wednesday to become the first lucky loser to reach the women's third round since 1993.\n\nKasatkina defeated 79th-ranked Ana Konjuh 6-4, 6-4. In a quarter of the draw full of upsets, she will face yet another unseeded player in the next round, 40th-ranked Kristina Mladenovic or 98th-ranked Bojana Jovanovski.\n\n12:15 p.m.:\n\nYoung American Madison Keys has reached the third round at the U.S. Open for the first time.\n\nThe 19th-seeded Keys needed just 54 minutes to beat 100th-ranked Tereza Smitkova of Czech Republic 6-1, 6-2 on Wednesday in a matchup of 20-year-olds.\n\nKeys has now advanced to at least the third round at every major this year, which started with her breakthrough run to the semifinals at the Australian Open.\n\nKeys, who didn't face a break point Wednesday, could meet Serena Williams in the fourth round. Before that, she could play 15th-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat her in three sets in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Radwanska takes on a fellow Polish player, 91st-ranked Magda Linette, later Wednesday.

0535_95f3b649-a593-4403-9cea-4f32c2c9cf01	As Iran hardliners continue to chant “death to America,” President Barack Obama is on the verge of getting congressional approval for his controversial Iranian nuclear agreement. Support from Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Bob Case, D-Pa., means the president is one vote away from clinching victory in the Senate. Despite furious opposition, 33 senators have now backed the deal. The president needs 34 to uphold his veto of a Republican measure disproving the agreement. Congress has till September 17 to vote for or against it. At the State Department, officials continued to stress Obama’s statement that the U.S. would impose further sanctions should Iran change its behavior toward the deal — and that it prevents Iran from becoming a nuclear power. “We’ve been very clear about what this agreement is about. It’s about stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,” State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner told reporters. But opponents of the deal, including retired Gen. Jerry Boykin, say it will actually have the opposite effect. “This is, in fact, a pathway to Iran having a nuclear weapon,” Boykin, who now serves as executive vice president of the Family Research Council, warned. In a letter last week, Boykin and nearly 200 other retired U.S. generals and admirals appealed to Congress to reject the deal. Boykin says the agreement also gives Iran access to more money to fund terror groups around the world. “There’s going to be a large amount of money — $150 billion [and] I’ve heard estimates that over a five-year period, that run as much as $700 billion, that is going to go into the coffers of a very rogue Islamic regime who is the biggest sponsor of terrorism,” Boykin said. “That means that Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist organizations are going to get a lot of money, which they can use against their two primary enemies, which is Israel and America,” he explained.

0536_61653e99-f114-436d-b424-3baedfa6c7d2	Usually I give the weekly 50/50 sale at Book Outlet a pass because it tends to be exclusive to a certain genre or style that does not have mass appeal.

0537_f97ec2ea-fe84-4359-8083-79c162b66827	NEW DELHI: Neal is 25 years old. He's in his sixth job, this time with a Bengaluru-based hyperlocal start up. Of his five previous jobs, only one was with a `conventional' firm, a consultancy . Neal is positive he doesn't want to go back to a company like that again. "Infosys, Wipro - companies like that are completely corporate," he says."Completely corporate" seems to be youthspeak for "staid" and "unexciting". \n\nThere's an excitement in the Bengaluru air. To be honest, it has always been there in some degree, ever since liberalization and the early days of Infosys and Wipro, through Y2K and outsourcing, through the tech majors opening in-house development centres in the city . \n\nBut over the past few years, the startup boom has added a new fizz to the city . The atmosphere has become heady , giddily intoxicating -there's a feeling that great things are happening here.You could track this feeling down to 2008-09, when Flipkart raised its first million from Accel Partners. Or you could say that the story really began on August 24, 2012, when the Bansals raised a whopping $ 150 million and suddenly, startups were everywhere. \n\nFor people like Neal, the flexibility of the startup life is the key attraction. "In a startup, processes aren't rigid. Adaptability is the key, and that's what makes it exciting," he says.There are downsides, of course."Well, your social life goes for a toss," he says. "You can't party on weekends when you have a seven-day week." \n\nFor Akshay BD, joining a startup was serendipity . "I studied law," he says. "After graduation, I joined a startup law firm." \n\nBut a profession that required years - if not decades - to establish oneself was too slow for him.In 2013, a friend put him on to a startup that was just beginning operations in Bengaluru. It was called Uber, and Akshay was vaguely familiar with what they did. \n\n"My first reaction was -I don't want to work for a taxi company . But then, as I understood what they were doing, I was blown away ." Akshay signed up."At first it was crazy. We would go from parking lot to parking lot, trying to convince cab drivers to sign up to our platform. I remember chasing a yellow-plate Toyota Altis cab seven km through Bengaluru roads to get the driver on Uber. We finally caught up and stopped him, only to find out that he had already signed up. I'm not sure what his passenger thought of us," he laughs. \n\nAkshay says that at that time, few people believed that Uber could succeed in India. "It was purely app-driven. You had to enter your credit card information.People kept telling us that the concept would never take off here. But we had to adapt. It was exciting, it was fun and look at where we are now," he says. \n\nExcitement. Fun. These are not words that young people normally associate with working life, except maybe those born salesmen who could make selling a photocopier one of the most thrilling jobs around. But that's what the startup boom has done.Work has never been cooler. \n\nYou can see it everywhere - in the Cafe Coffee Days in Electronic City to the startup hub that Koramangala has become to the tonier outposts on the roof of UB City . If you listen, you will hear snatches of conversation about pitches and funding, about pivots and disruption. PR firms peddle stories of apps and platforms.Spouses talk of supporting families so that significant others can work with startups. \n\nThe closest parallel to this, of course, is the dot-com bubble, when everybody was either starting up or was part of a web portal that promised everything from shopping to research services, and techie water ing-holes buzzed with dis cussions on Po Bronson and the wisdom of The Cluetrain Manifesto. What ever the analogues, it's like a virus. And it's affecting people across all age groups. \n\nFifty-year-old Gyane swaran worked with a re puted IT services MNC for more than 12 years, heading its retail practice. But he found himself growing too comfortable. "I needed to give myself a good kick," he says. He quit his job and joined Qwikcilver, the Amazonfunded gift card startup. \n\n"You need to rediscover yourself at different points in your life," he says. "Career planning isn't linear. You need to stay relevant to the industry . And sometimes, that can only come when you let go of a cushy job and put yourself in harm's way ," he says. \n\nPeople mature faster than organizations can handle. After a point, the pace of promotion and the acquisition of responsibility slow down, and large organizations offer only two choices - a steady state at the current position, or intense politicking to move up the ladder. And for some, it's not enough. "Companies with well-established processes don't always provide the best possible support to independent decision makers. The speed at which things moved wasn't enough for me. Here, the culture is completely different," Gyaneswaran says. \n\nHis co-worker, Pragati Deep Singh, echoes his sentiments.Singh walked away from a prime banking job with HDFC, where he was responsible for a Rs 2,000 crore portfolio to take over as Qwikcilver's online channels business. "In HDFC, procedures are in place. I had independence, yes, but it was limited to a specific area. Working here, I have the freedom to do things my way ." \n\nWith that freedom comes risk as well. "There, if something didn't work, there were always management protocols that would limit risk. Here, it's all or nothing. That adds to the excitement. I get a 360 degree view of the business. I deal with regulators, with the RBI, I have to handle our licences. I'm an employee, but I feel like an entrepreneur," he says. \n\nAnother positive, though it doesn't immediately come off as such, is the presence of young people - people who haven't been taught to think in a particular way . The startup industry in India is predominantly young. Like Terry Pratchett's Leonard of Quirm, it has "no use for people who have learned the limits of the possible." It doesn't matter that most of these startups will fail, that however hard people try , most startups will fold within a matter of months. " A few of us (angel investors) have been questioning how long this can last. For the past couple of years, there's been so much money in the system that even some of the most unlikely companies have managed to get funded. But after a while, the investors will want returns. Personally, I think that's likely to happen anywhere between six months to a couple of years. There needs to be a shakeout, and the results could be devastating," says one angel investor, on condition of anonymity . "But right now, we're all going with the flow - we just don't want to miss out on the next big thing."
0538_11c54359-b88c-45eb-8af2-78b97c8a6317	Teaching your kids how to write computer programs\n// Kogonuso\n\nby Marshall Brain Let's say that you have children, and you would like to help them learn computer programming at a youngish age. As the father of four kids, I have tried to approach it from several different angles. What I would like to do here is collect some ideas for parents who are looking for different options.\nLet's start with a something important: Every kid is different. Some kids are reading and writing fluently years ahead of other kids. For them, learning to program is probably easier. Some kids have the basic analytical skills a lot earlier than others (Here's a story about a 9-year-old writing full-blown iPhone apps). And so on. You try to expose your kids to programming and it may or may not "take" the first time, simply because of these differences. So you wait a few months and try again, or you might try a different approach. Understand that, the first time you try to introduce your kids to programming, your kids might not "get it" at all. And that's OK.\nThe second thing to realize is that real analytical skills often don't start appearing until age 11 or 12 or 13 in many kids, so expecting huge breakthroughs prior to that may be unrealistic.\nThat being said, there are lots of fun things you can try as early as five or six...\n\nGamesLet's start with a few games. Here are three games that my kids have particularly enjoyed. They teach basic problem solving ideas in different ways:\n\n\nMagic Pen (wait 15 seconds to see word "play")\nFantastic Contraption\nAuditorium\n\n\nIf you look around on the web you can find lots of "problem solving" games like these three.\nThen there is this game, which actually does a very good job of teaching simple programming skills:\n\n\nLight Bot (the "Play" button is on the bottom right, under the ad, after it loads)\n\n\n\nI love Light Bot. It will engage kids for a couple of hours, starting at age 7 or 8. Some of the puzzles in LightBot are too hard for kids. There are walkthroughs on YouTube that help.\nPrefer games on a tablet or phone? Wired.com recently recommended a robot app here. See also this list.\n\nLOGOAs soon as you try Light Bot it may remind you a little of LOGO - a language for younger kids. You can find out more about it on a page like this:\nLOGO Programming\nOr jump into Google. There is lots of stuff about LOGO on the Web.\n\nPython for KidsLogo is pretty limited. What if you want to teach your kids a "real" programming language? Python may be a good option to try because it is now fairly ubiquitous and it is easy to get started. These tutorials can get you going fast:\nPython Turotials\nOr type "Python for kids" into Google - there is lots of stuff out there.\n\nBigger efforts One thing that one of my kids enjoyed quite a bit is Lego Mindstorms. This is a Lego robotics kit. I've seen kids as young as six or seven doing meaningful programs with it. It uses a graphical language that is pretty simple to understand. If you don't mind blowing $200, then it is definitely worth a look. If you find that your kid really likes it, you might also look into FIRST Lego League (FLL teams build Mindstorms robots, work on presentations, etc.). One of my kids has been on an FLL team for several years and it has been great for him.\nThe good thing about Mindstorms is that it lets kids build some interesting stuff. The problem is that, after a month or two, you may find that you have come to the limits of what it can do. [Yes, there are adults on YouTube showing off some amazing, advanced stuff, but I suspect that these people are geniuses.]\nA friend recommended this educational system for programming robot simulations. It is free:\nRoboMind\nAnother big effort like this is Phrogram, formerly known as Kids Programming Language. KPL had the huge advantage that it was free and pretty amazing. It came with dozens of sample programs and could do both simple and complex things (for example, a really good pinball machine was one of the samples). But for some reason they killed KPL off and morphed it into Phrogram. Phrogram is $50, and I haven't tried it, but assuming that it is a similar package it might be worth it.\nOn these pages, a father talks about his efforts to teach programming to his daughter using a tool called Greenfoot:\n\n\nTeaching my daughter to code - Part 1\nTeaching my daughter to code - Part 2\nTeaching my daughter to code - Part 3\nTeaching my daughter to code - Part 4\n\n\nWhich is interesting. He's able to create some pretty sophisticated stuff with her using object oriented techniques.\nIn a similar object oriented vein is a free system from MIT called Scratch:\n\n\nScratch\n\n\nMy kids played with this for a couple of days.\nIf your kids would like to create games, here is one option to try:\n\n\nGameMaker\n\n\nGameMaker is a pretty sophisticated tool with a lot of options. There are tutorials to help you get started. I would not use this as a "first foray" perhaps, but it is something to consider for a second foray.\nAlso there is a free eBook on creating games with Python which states, "written to be understandable by kids as young as 10 to 12 years old, although it is great for anyone of any age who has never programmed before":\n\n\nInvent with Python\n\n\nA friend has suggested that this is a nice intro.\nOne other thing to try is:\n\n\nCodecademy.com\n\n\nThe tagline is: "Codecademy is the easiest way to learn how to code. It's interactive, fun, and you can do it with your friends."\n\nMIT App InventorThis summer my twins (age 12) took a class using the MIT App Inventor. This is an impressive system for creating simple apps on Android devices. The twins were creating simple Android apps on the first day, and went on to create a bunch of apps themselves. They really enjoyed it!\nMIT App Inventor\nIf you would like an introduction, you can find lots of introductory videos like these:\n\nMaking Web SitesWhat if your kid wants to make web sites? This is a programming realm now. Here is one free, comprehensive educational experience I have seen:\n\n\nThe Odin Project\n\n\nAgain, this is not for little kids, but definitely possible for teens with the knack. It covers a lot of ground: HTML, CSS, Ruby on rails, Javascript, etc. This could be a career path if your kid really enjoys this stuff - a lot of opportunities are available in the job market.\nWhat about a simple web site, without any programming at all? I would recommend Wordpress. You can get started with it here:\n\n\nWordpress: A simple and quick way to create a web site\n\n\nYou can do some amazing things without any code. But it really helps if the kid is "technical" and likes putting things together.\n\nReal programming - Stanford's Java ClassMy son (around age 13) started using Stanford's free online Java class and he has gotten a lot out of it. The class includes [youtube http://youtube.com/w/?v=KkMDCCdjyW8] and class assignments that reinforce the concepts discussed in class. The programming environment used in the class is called Eclipse. Eclipse is a full-featured development tool with a great debugger and it is free too. This is the class my son took:\nIntroduction to Computer Science | Programming Methodology\nSee also:\nCS106A: Programming Methodologies\nOur son needed a little encouragement from his parents (i.e. deadlines) to get through the first assignments, but by the time be got to Programming Assignment #4 (writing the code for the game called "Breakout") he was completely engaged and extended that basic game in a number of directions without any prompting from us. I feel like this class taught him the essence of being a "real" programmer.\nStanford has many classes to explore - click for list. Their offerings represent a valuable resource for anyone wanting to learn programming.\nOnce comfortable with Java, something like this might be interesting to try - a combination of Greenfoot and Java:\n\nReal programming - C and C++ ProgrammingThe C and C++ programming languages are two of the most widely used programming languages in the world. There are free compilers that are readily available and lots of tutorial information can be found for free. Here are two resources that can help get you started:\n\n\nThe Basics of C Programming\nC Programming and C++ Programming\n\n\nGoogle is your friend and can help you find tons of other stuff.\n\nLearning to write iPhone and iPad appsWriting apps for the iPhone and iPad is not for newbies, but it is definitely something that middle school and high school students can master if they have a knack for programming. And the audience for these apps is gigantic through the App Store that Apple operates. Here are the steps that you need to take if you want to get started:\n\n\nStep 1 - Step 1 is to buy a Mac computer from Apple so that you can compile apps. The cheapest entry point is a Mac Mini at $600. A MacBook Pro is a laptop that costs about twice as much.\nStep 2 - Once you own a Mac, go to the Mac App Store and download XCode. It is free. This package contains the development environment, the compiler, SDK and libraries, and a simulator so you can test your apps on simulated iPhones and iPads.\nStep 3 - Apple offers a series of introductory tutorials:\n\n\nStart Developing iOS Apps Today\nCreating Your First iOS App - Hello, World\nCreating Your Second iOS App - Storyboards\nYour Third iOS App: iCloud\n\n\n\nStep 4 - Take the Stanford class on app development: CS 193P iPhone Application Development. Here is the first lecture:\nStep 5 - Once you develop your first app then it is time for Your First App Store Submission - You have to pay $99 to join the Apple Developers Program to take this step.\n\n\nGoogle can help you to answer nearly any question or problem you run into as you are learning.\n\nWhat about Android Apps?After talking about Apple Apps, it is only fair to talk about the Android platform too. Here is the "official site":\n\n\nBuilding Your First App\n\n\nIt is some pretty technical stuff. A teen with the knack should be able to approach it though. This page follows the same vein:\n\n\nWant to Learn How to Program for Android? Start Here\n\n\nGoogle is your friend, again. Use phrases like "Getting started with android apps" and "How to write your first android app". Find something that feels comfortable for your teen.

So I would like to spend a little time here talking about it. It is not cheap, but it has three things going for it:\n\n\nIt combines programming and simple electronics\nThe programming tends to be very simple\nYou can do real things with it, or at least things that seem realer (to my kids anyway) than Mindstorms.\n\n\nWe were first introduced to the BASIC Stamp when we found this kit at Radio Shack for $90:\nWhat's a Microcontroller BASIC Stamp Kit\nYou can also order it here:\nBASIC Stamp Activity Kit\nThe big caveat is that you need to have a computer with a serial port to use it. If you do not have such a computer (most computers made since 2005 don't have a serial port), then you need the USB version of the kit for $160:\nBASIC Stamp Discovery Kit - Serial (With USB Adapter and Cable)\nAnd if you are going to do that, I might suggest you consider this robot kit instead, because it is the same price:\nBoe-Bot Robot Kit - USB Version\nSo, already, you can see that the BASIC Stamp is not simple or cheap. We've already had to worry about port types and which kit to get. And if that puts you off, so be it.\nBut we did buy the kit at Radio Shack, and we did have an older machine with a serial port, and we did get it set up and it did all work and... here is what was amazing about it. My kid could sit down with the book, by himself, and on his own he could wire up little circuits and write little pieces of code and get it all working. The programs and the electronics are easy enough that a 10-year-old can manage it. This is admittedly simple stuff, like wiring up a push button and having it make an LED blink, or making a servo motor turn or making sounds come out of a speaker. But the idea that my kid (who hates reading for the most part) could get this stuff working was impressive. And then he could think of extensions on his own. Trivial extensions, yes, like making two LEDs blink, but extensions.\nThe nice thing about this approach is that you can buy other pieces at Parallax.com and they are pretty easy to hook up. One of the first things we bought was a PIR module ($10), which is the kind of thing you use in a burglar alarm or an automatic light to sense a warm human body. We also bought a little text LCD panel ($25). And he built a device that could count people as they walked by. If you have a family of six people, how many times do they use the stairs in the house? How many times do they open the refrigerator? With this device you can find out. (The refrigerator was funny - it was opened something like 50 times a day!)\nNext thing was a ultrasonic sensor ($30). With that and the LCD display you can build a little ultrasonic tape measure. They have a lot of little sensors like this that you can try. We've used the accelerometer, the thermometer, the RFID tag reader, etc.\nHis latest adventure is with the GPS module ($90) and the USB memory stick reader/writer ($35), which he used in a science fair project. With the USB memory stick thing, you can plug in a USB memory stick (AKA "thumb drive") and read and write files. So you can create a text file and start dumping in data. Then you can hook up the GPS, let it gather data and save the data into the memory stick. With that you can create bread crumb trails everywhere you go. You can then plug the memory stick into your laptop's USB port, load the data into a spreadsheet and do a scatter graph...\n...or you can drop the data into Google maps as described here:\nMapping GPS Coordinates using Google Maps\nAs it turns out, the Parallax GPS is not the greatest. When we first hooked it up, it would never get a lock on the satellites. After an hour of probing on Google, we found out that you have to mount the GPS about 10 inches away from the Stamp (because of electrical noise generated by the Stamp). It would have been wonderful if this fact had been revealed in the Parallax documentation. But even after you do that, this device can have trouble getting a lock sometimes (ours doesn't work at all in rainy weather, for example). It does work in the car if you put it on the dashboard, but not from the interior. [All of these problems eventually led us to a site called Sparkfun.com, which has a much better selection of GPS modules that are slightly less easy to use.]\nIt also led us looking for material on the web about the BASIC Stamp. There is a lot of it. For example, there are people building autopilots from BASIC Stamps:\n\n\nBasic Stamp autopilot tutorial, part 3 (this is the page that taught us not to put the GPS on the Stamp board)\nBASIC Stamp UAV code now in beta\n\n\nYou can find all kinds of stuff like that. Then you discover that there are many other platforms more advanced than the Stamp, like for example the Arduino, the Teensy, the Microchip PICkit (see also this book and this book), the Gumstix, etc.\n\nThe ArduinoSince this article was first written, the Arduino platform has really taken off and replaced the BASIC Stamp in the hearts and minds of hobbyists. There are so many different flavors of Arduino, so many different accessories, so many different kits, that it is now a very rich environment, and a lot of fun.\nHere are some examples of different kits available:\n\n\nArduino Kits\nKits\nArduino Kits\nArduino stuff\nSensor kit\nProgramming Arduino: Getting Started With Sketches\n\n\nThe easiest way to get started with the Arduino is to buy one (for example, buy an Arduino Uno) and start programming. This article is a great introduction to getting the development environment downloaded to your machine and starting to program:\nArduino How To\nThe first time I tried it, it did not work. There were two settings (the type of Arduino and the com port) that I had to set, and the article provided guidance. We have purchased a number of accessories, including this touch screen, and have had a lot of fun with Arduinos.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Then there is the Raspberry Pi - a very small but complete computer that fits in your hand. You hook it up to a keyboard, mouse and monitor and turn it on. It boots up a version of Linux and you can start programming. It comes with Scratch (see above) and Python and can easily handle other stuff. It can also send signals to hardware like Stamps and Arduinos do. I own a Pi, its camera, a relay board, etc. My kids and I have played with it. But for some reason it never really caught on with them.\n\nConclusionThe point is, if you want to introduce your kids to programming, there are MANY different ways to do it. If you want to go down this road, Google is your friend. It is amazing how much stuff is out there. Just start looking, try different things with your kids, and see what works for you. It can be a lot of fun.
0539_acf3cc55-b9a4-4756-afa8-e9fd8de2b2d7	 \nWeinstein comes out against mandatory minimum sentences, change in rules on use of live fire against stone-throwers \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Sunday to tighten punishments for Palestinian rioters, dismissing Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein’s more cautious approach and declaring that the government would set policy despite opposition from the judiciary. \n\nDuring a meeting at the meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem earlier Sunday to discuss Israel’s response to the recent flare-up of violence in the capital, Weinstein expressed his opposition to a proposal to relax the rules governing police use of live fire against Palestinians throwing stones or firebombs in Jerusalem and the West Bank. He did however agree to review the procedures, Army Radio reported. \n\nIn a closed-door conversation after the meeting, Netanyahu said he is determined to implement changes including minimum sentences for anyone throwing stones and petrol bombs, easing the rules of engagement for the security forces, and heavy fines for parents of minors who throw stones, Israel’s NRG website reported. \n\n“The government is sovereign, and it decides – even if it is contrary to the position of the judiciary,” the prime minister said. \n\nThe attorney general also came out against proposed legislation to enforce mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of throwing rocks or firebombs at police, civilians or cars in Jerusalem and across the West Bank — key legislative changes sought by Netanyahu as part of a crackdown announced at an emergency meeting last Tuesday. \n\nInstead, he suggested instituting minimum sentences for such offenses through a one-year temporary provision. \n\nWeinstein did authorize the use in East Jerusalem of the Ruger rifle, a .22 caliber firearm with a capacity to neutralize without being as potentially deadly as heavier weapons, and indicated at the meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office that it was a sufficient measure for the moment. \n\nAccording to the Haaretz daily, Weinstein’s opposition to harsher penalties prompted Netanyahu to soften his tone, and issue a statement Sunday declaring that he was “leaning toward the idea raised in the meeting to stiffen penalties – setting mandatory minimum penalties for stone-throwers by means of a temporary provision that would be in place for a year at the first stage. \n\n” \n\n“A temporary provision for a few years will be studied,” read the statement. \n\nThe matter is set to be finalized at a meeting Netanyahu has convened for Thursday. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked is said to be looking for a three-year provision. \n\nAt Sunday’s meeting, Netanyahu ordered a review of the rules of engagement used by police officers. He is said to be considering allowing police to use live fire in certain circumstances when civilian lives are in danger. \n\nPermission would be granted “in very limited instances, with lots of restrictions,” Israel’s Channel 2 said Saturday. It would likely be granted during incidents considered “grassroots terror” or lone-wolf attacks, as opposed to during mass demonstrations, the report said, noting nonetheless that this would represent a marked departure from current procedures in East Jerusalem and Israel. \n\nNetanyahu said Sunday that revoking social security benefits for parents of minors caught offending would be an “appro…

U.S. firms are now allowed to send supplies to private Cuban businesses and export telephones, computers and Internet technology.\n\nStill, efforts by U.S. businesses to expand trade and tourism have encountered bureaucratic hurdles in both countries that have hindered growth.\n\nCredit card companies still cannot transfer payments to Cuba and telecommunications firms have not been able to get equipment to the island, which is 90 miles south of Florida. Meanwhile, Cuba's government does not run its Internet connection anywhere near capacity levels.\n\nThe Treasury and Commerce departments recently announced updated regulations aimed at easing procedures for U.S. citizens who want to travel or do business in Cuba. The former Cold War foes are expected to resume direct postal service by the end of the year.\n\nThe new council said it will also urge the Cuban government to make policy changes that lessen control over Cuban businesses. Cubans frequently complain about the rigidity of their country's system and have also expressed growing concern about inequality.

0542_4876fa3e-7a79-4dd1-bddc-163d3d1c2b74	LONDON: The sale of oven maker Aga Rangemaster to a U.S. owner with global ambitions caps the transformation of a quintessential English country brand created by some of the biggest names in global design, advertising: and espionage. \n\nThe acquisition of Aga for US$202 million by Middleby Corporation follows a brief bidding war with U.S. rival Whirlpool for the maker of the colorful cast-iron stoves that can weigh as much as a male polar bear, cost US$18,000 and, in older versions, take two days to heat. \n  Aga Chief Executive William McGrath speaks at the Aga Festival 2015 in London, Britain September 20, 2015. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor   \nThe deal, set to be completed this week, marks the latest in a list of premium British brands to fall under foreign ownership in recent years, to the dismay of some business commentators who want to see it kept in British hands. \n\nBut the sale to a U.S. company is also testament to the enduring appeal of a product invented in 1922, the year James Joyce's "Ulysses" was published and radio took off. \n\nIn Britain, it has become synonymous with aspirational middle-class country living and inspires huge loyalty in owners, including members of the royal family and Prime Minister David Cameron. \n\nIt struggled as demand was hit during the global financial crisis, but has recently returned to form with modern, more efficient versions of the cooker, and hopes to build on its heritage by exploiting Middleby's global network. \n\n"The fundamental design of the Aga has always been its virtue but behind the front and the look is now a completely different product," Aga Rangemaster CEO William McGrath told Reuters, before he steps down as part of the sale. \n\n"The design makes it iconic, the radiant heat makes it iconic but how it is delivered is something that has changed from generation to generation, from solid fuel, through oil and gas to electric and now programmable electric." \n\nThe heat, created by the continuously burning stove, made the old Aga distinctive, but it also drew its critics. \n\nGreat in winter when it could heat half the house, one owner complained that you "sweat buckets while boiling an egg" in summer. For many the cost of fuel can also prove prohibitive while environmental groups criticized the impact of the traditional stoves. \n\nModern versions can be easily switched on and off, including with a smartphone, while smaller models have been created to appeal to city dwellers. \n\nAround 80 percent of those sold today are the newer, more efficient designs that have been launched since 2011, and are offered in a variety of colors from rose, pewter and lemon to pistachio and aubergine. \n\n"You can get all the virtues of an Aga in a 60 centimeter package, which is something we'd expect over the next five to 10 years to become a more and more appreciable part of the business," said McGrath. The largest version of the stove can be 2.5 times that size. \n\nASPIRATIONAL LIVING \n\nMcGrath said the new owner was also drawn to its heritage - a company with a history that reads like a spy novel. \n\nCreated in 1922, the first Aga was invented by Swedish Nobel Prize winning physicist Gustaf Dalen who, confined to his home after being blinded in an accident, witnessed his wife struggling to cook on their old range. \n\nBy 1929 manufacturing had begun in central England, with early sales driven by David Ogilvy, a salesman who went on to become one of the most famous advertising men in the world, the original 'Mad Men' and founder of the Ogilvy & Mather ad agency. \n\nNewer versions were designed by Raymond Loewy - who produced some of the most famous product designs in history, including Greyhound Scenicruiser buses, Coca-cola vending machines, Lucky Strike boxes and the livery of Air Force One. He worked with Douglas Scott, who later designed London's famous red buses. \n\nA written history of the company notes however that several of the leading protagonists including Ogilvy, his brother Francis and W.T. Wren, an early Aga boss, also played important roles for Britain in World War Two, either as spies, writing for Winston Churchill or in aircraft manufacturing. \n\nBritain is still Aga's biggest market but they can now be found in the United States, Europe and China, and Middleby aims to take the brand further afield. \n\nThe sale adds to concern among some Britons about the number of prominent companies that have been bought by foreign owners, including department store Harrods, toy brand Hamleys and chocolate maker Cadbury. They fear that such sales could ultimately put UK jobs at risk and dilute much of the brand's appeal - its intrinsic Britishness. \n\nMcGrath is more positive, saying his firm hopes to mirror the success of another luxury British brand, Jaguar Land Rover, which has flourished under the ownership of India's Tata Group. \n\n"We'd love to get in the wheel tracks of Jaguar Land Rover," said McGrath. "Now the product has evolved, the potential can be immense because the brand is much loved." \n\n(Editing by Susan Fenton) \n\n- Reuters
0543_9783f41c-a681-4bec-a264-fd0882ae0cf7	The Lancaster County District Attorney's Office couldn't say whether the man who shot another man in the parking lot of a Lancaster County restaurant following a road rage incident was justified, but the office ruled charges were not warranted. The Lancaster County District Attorney's Office reviewed the incident ruling that James Mellinger Sr., 74, should not be charged for shooting Darrel Smith, 31, on the morning of May 6 in the parking lot of Family Cupboard Restaurant in Warwick Township. The office was also asked to determine if the shooting justified, did not rule on that fact, according to a news release. Mellinger and Smith said there was a confrontation after the two were driving on Newport Road. The men exchanged words and Smith then confronted Mellinger when the two pulled into the parking lot of the Family Cupboard Restaurant, according to the news release. Mellinger drew his gun but never aimed it at Smith, according to the news release. Smith was hit by accidental gunfire as the two engaged in a brief scuffle.\nThe shot struck Smith in the jaw, which said was consistent with Mellinger's account of the incident that the shooting was accidental, according to the news release.  "This incident remains a stark reminder of the dangers of road rage, and of confronting drivers yourself — regardless of what they have done on the road," Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said in the release. Stedman also encouraged drivers to contact police or leave the scene if there is a road rage incident. Part of the reasonable doubt cited in the situation preventing criminal recklessness charges was the fact that Smith pursued Mellinger. Rather than taking his children to their destination, Smith arguably confronted and ignored Mellinger's warnings, Stedman said in the news release. "We are fortunate no one was killed and children were not injured," Stedman said.
0544_8a98f688-a425-477c-af91-584cb482ff94	We ladies think about, well, everything. At the same time. What happened at work this week is stressing you out about your relationship. That thoughtless comment you accidently told your neighbor is worrying you as you contemplate the grocery list. And that, possibly, is the reason women find it so unbelievable when a man claims he is thinking about “nothing.” In a Reddit thread, men gave these insightful confessions about what “nothing” actually means. Incoherency The majority of men agreed that nothing actually meant they were thinking of something that wouldn't make sense if explained. User Dazarath explained it this way, “Sometimes I just look around and admire the shapes or formations of different objects, but if I were to actually describe it, the conversation would go something like this. ‘What are you thinking about?’ ‘That piece of cloth on the ground.’ ‘What about it?’ ‘Just the shape that it forms.’ ‘What does it look like?’ ‘Umm, it looks like itself. But it's an interesting shape.’” The obvious Reddit user Rtrfgy described the ‘nothing’ feeling this way, "If I'm staring off into space and not really thinking about anything else, I might be making the general observation like "oh, that's a pen" but that isn't anything more than just my visual observation.” Laziness It’s not that his mind is completely off but it might just take far too much effort to explain his thought process. This means the something going on in his mind is not worth going into. Something you won’t like Some fights are not worth fighting. If he knows you won’t agree with what he’s thinking, he may choose to avoid the issue altogether. “When I have said what I'm actually thinking about I'm often greeted with skepticism,” user Meatros wrote. “So it's just easier [to say nothing] all around.” Can’t remember “It's not so much nothing as it is that I'm thinking about something of such little consequence that when you ask me what I'm thinking, I've already forgotten it so I say 'nothing’,” user Deandalec said. Dinosaurs To our delight, several users mentioned dinosaurs among the nothingness grouping. Anepiclie described nothing meaning "inane nonsense" - like dinosaurs – while Luvmilkshakes made the observation, “It would rock to have a pet dinosaur.” Super Random stuff Naval lint, Ron Swanson standing behind a meditating Chris, how many cups of pudding would fit in a bag. These thoughts don’t exactly make for the best conversation, so mentioning them may not seem like his best option. Nerd alert These answers ranged from cats riding horses to Mordor to beating a complicated video game. This explanation from an anonymous user is a particular gem that highlights the true inner “nothing” nerd explanation. “Most recently (true story) I was asked what I'm contemplating since I was obviously starting into space, and in reality I was following a long train of thought about my Game Genie and Final Fantasy 6 on SNES and thinking about how I used a code to make all the spells get learned at a 10x rate and wondering if I could use Game Guardian to create a similar hack on my android - and how curious it is that that multiplier is actually stored at a single, consistent place in memory. It seems like the more obvious "cheat code" would be to have each battle give you 255 AP.” \nFood \n\nUser Herewegoga1n said it best, “All I wanted was a Pepsi...” \nNothing As much as it might boggle your mind to think about, he might actually be thinking about nothing. User Zartonk possibly explained this best, “Sometimes I have some background music going on in my head, and I just sit there, sitting....”

0547_9d248f20-66ff-48da-a326-90055d004be2	Charles Krauthammer (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger) \n\nWASHINGTON — Once again, President Obama and his foreign policy team are stumped. Why is Vladimir Putin pouring troops and weaponry into Syria? After all, as Secretary of State John Kerry has thrice told his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, it is only making things worse. \n\nBut worse for whom? For the additional thousands of civilians who will die or flee as a result of the inevitably intensified fighting. True, and I’m sure Lavrov is as moved by their plight as by the 8,000 killed in Russia’s splendid little Ukrainian adventure. \n\nKerry and Obama are serially surprised because they cannot fathom the hard men in the Kremlin. Yet Putin’s objectives in Syria are blindingly obvious: \n\n1. To assert Russia’s influence in the Middle East and make it the dominant outside power. Putin’s highest ambition is to avenge and reverse Russia’s humiliating loss of superpower status a quarter-century ago. Understanding this does not come easily to an American president who for seven years has been assiduously curating America’s decline abroad. \n\n2. To sustain Russia’s major and long-standing Arab ally. Ever since Anwar Sadat kicked the Soviets out of Egypt in 1972, Syria’s Assads have been Russia’s principal asset in the Middle East. \n\n3. To expand the reach of Russia’s own military. It has a naval base at Tartus, its only such outside of Russia. It has an airfield near Latakia, now being expanded with an infusion of battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, howitzers and housing for 1,500 — strongly suggesting ground forces to follow. \n\n4. To push out the Americans. For Putin, geopolitics is a zero-sum game: Russia up, America down. He is demonstrating whom you can rely on in this very tough neighborhood. Obama has given short shrift to the Kurds, shafted America’s allies with the Iran deal and abandoned the Anbar Sunnis who helped us win the surge. Meanwhile, Putin risks putting Russian boots on the ground to rescue his Syrian allies. \n\nObama says Bashar al-Assad has to go, draws a red line on chemical weapons — and does nothing. Russia acts on behalf of a desperate ally. Whom do you want in your corner? \n\n5. To re-legitimize post-Crimea Russia by making it indispensable in Syria. It’s a neat two-cushion shot. At the U.N. next week, Putin will offer Russia as a core member of a new anti-Islamic State coalition. Obama’s Potemkin war — with its phantom local troops (our $500 million training program has yielded five fighters so far) and flaccid air campaign — is flailing badly. What Putin is proposing is that Russia, Iran and Hezbollah spearhead the anti-jihadist fight. \n\nPutin’s offer is clear: Stop fighting Assad, accept Russia as a major player and acquiesce to a Russia-Iran-Hezbollah regional hegemony — and we will lead the drive against the Islamic State from in front. \n\nAnd there is a bonus. The cleverest part of the Putin gambit is its unstated cure for Europe’s refugee crisis. \n\nWracked by guilt and fear, the Europeans have no idea what to do. Putin offers a way out: No war, no refugees. Stop the Syrian civil war and not only do they stop flooding into Europe, those already there go back home to Syria. \n\nPutin says, settle the war with my client in place — the Assad regime joined by a few “healthy” opposition forces — and I solve your refugee nightmare. \n\nYou almost have to admire the cynicism. After all, what’s driving the refugees is the war and what’s driving the war is Iran and Russia. They provide the materiel, the funds and now, increasingly, the troops that fuel the fighting. The arsonist plays fireman. \n\nAfter all, most of the refugees are not fleeing the Islamic State. Its depravity is more ostentatious, but it is mostly visited upon minorities, Christian and Yazidi — and they have already been largely ethnically cleansed from Islamic State territory. The European detention camps are overflowing with Syrians fleeing Assad’s barbarism, especially his attacks on civilians, using artillery, chlorine gas and nail-filled barrel bombs. \n\nPutin to the rescue. As with the chemical weapons debacle, he steps in to save the day. If we acquiesce, Russia becomes an indispensable partner. It begins military and diplomatic coordination with us. (We’ve just agreed to negotiations over Russia’s Syrian buildup.) Its post-Ukraine isolation is lifted and, with Iran, it becomes the regional arbiter. \n\nIn the end, the Putin strategy may not work, but it’s deadly serious and not at all obscure. The White House can stop scratching its collective head whenever another Condor transport unloads its tanks and marines at Latakia. \n\nContact Charles Krauthammer at letters@charleskrauthammer.com. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1KnzaZu
0548_7cdef5a9-41dc-41cc-9809-f486415842bb	NEW YORK (Reuters) - First responders who were injured or sickened by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington said they will visit Congress with comedian Jon Stewart to push lawmakers to extend expiring medical programs as Friday marked 14 years since 9/11.\n\nActivists believe the former host of "The Daily Show," who they say was instrumental in persuading Congress to pass the programs in the Zadroga Act of 2010, can again help their effort.\n\n"We pitched a solid eight innings and then Jon Stewart came in and closed in 2010," said John Feal, founder of the Feal Good Foundation, which advocates for injured or ill 9/11 emergency personnel.\n\nFeal and representatives from other first responder groups confirmed Stewart's involvement. Stewart was not immediately available for comment.\n\nNearly 3,000 people died when hijackers crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. Tens of thousands of firefighters, police officers and construction workers reported for months to clean up the site that became known as Ground Zero.\n\nThe World Trade Center Health Program, the part of the act that provides care to more than 70,000 responders, is set to expire in October.\n\nResponders and advocates are pushing for a permanent extension and fear that anything less will eventually leave responders with financial burdens from expensive treatment.\n\nIn 2010, Stewart featured the bill, which had met strong Republican opposition in Congress, on "The Daily Show," interviewing four first-responders. The bill passed days later.\n\n"That was really the catalyst for getting it done," said Kenny Specht, a retired New York firefighter who appeared on the show and contracted thyroid cancer after spending months working at Ground Zero.\n\n"You get ordered to go there, you get ordered to stay there, you get ordered to do a lot of crazy work, and then a couple years later, you get sick," he said.\n\nStewart ended his 16-year run on "The Daily Show" in August, but Specht said the former host is still influential.\n\n"Jon Stewart and our first responders shouldn't have to be in Washington walking the halls of Congress to keep the health care program running that our heroes need and deserve," U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York and the bill's sponsor, said in a statement.
0549_51ebb007-e388-45a8-9d3b-6fa7e0ed1b62	Kevin Boss felt burned out as he reached the end of his freshman football season at Philomath High. \n\nHe was battling injuries and decided to skip basketball. In his newly found downtime he got introduced to the weight room by PHS coaches Troy Muir and Chris Sexton. \n\n“I was able to make some changes,” he said. “I got stronger. I lifted a lot. It just took off from there.” \n\nBoss, a 2002 PHS grad, went from a young man who didn’t know much about weights to a college basketball and football player at Western Oregon who talked a coach into getting him a key for the weight room. \n\nLooking back, Boss credits his weight work for helping him reach the levels of athletic success he did. He went on to win a Super Bowl with the New York Giants during his rookie season in 2008. His NFL career as a tight end stretched five-plus seasons. \n\nAn interest in weight training led him down a career path. \n\nFor the past year he’s been the director of strength and conditioning at Bend Hoops Academy, a business inside which he also runs Boss Sports Performance. \n\nA 31-year-old certified personal trainer and self-proclaimed fitness and nutrition geek, he works with high school and middle school students throughout the year and trains college athletes in the summer. His goal is to eventually work with post-collegiate football players training for the NFL Combine. \n\nNFL training camps have gotten underway and there’s no love lost with Boss for this time of year. \n\n“I don’t miss training camp in the least bit. It was an absolute grind,” he said, remembering the stress of that period every season, being away from his family and friends while trying to make a team. \n\nWhat Boss does miss are the friendships through the sport he’s made along the way. Particularly with the Giants, where he spent four seasons. \n\nBoss’ job combines basketball — the sport he considers his “first love” — and personal training, for which he developed a passion. \n\n“It’s been great. I love it,” he said. “I love working with the youth. It’s been a great post-football career move for me.” \n\nBend’s surroundings lead to Boss working with athletes in a number of sports. The typical ball sports are included, plus skiing and lacrosse. \n \nBoss says his love of the job is seeing young people who might not be very interested in the program when they start but make progress and gain confidence by the time they’re done. \n\n“That to me is just as neat and special as the kid that comes in and puts on 10 to 15 pounds,” he said. \n\nHis full-time job has taken away from his high school coaching opportunities. In recent years he’s spent time with the football and boys basketball programs at Summit in Bend. He plans to continue pursuing volunteer opportunities there. \n\nBoss and wife Bree have two boys — Zeke, who will turn 3 later this month, and Houck, who turned 1 in June — and are expecting a baby girl in early November. \n\nThey settled in Bend about two years ago and found a new home. \n\n“I think we will be here for life,” he said.
0550_cc128501-1edf-489a-b5d4-893e6d4a7106	The 44-year-old man accused of killing his wife in a bomb explosion at her in their Amanzimtoti home last month has been denied bail in the Durban Magistrates Court. Former Air Force Colonel Joel Mohoasa is alleged to have thrown two hand grenades at 33-year-old Letshego Mohoasa following an argument over money. Only one of them exploded.  \n \nWhile the State was not opposed to bail Magistrate Vanitha Armu said she did not share the same opinion. Armu says she's satisfied that the State has a prima facie case against Mohoasa - referring to the eye witness account who alleges that he saw the accused pull the pin on the grenade.  \n \nShe also says the accused has shown more concern for himself than for his two young children - as he left them in the house as he fled following the explosion. \n \n Armu has further added that even if the deceased was abusive,as argued by the defence in court last week ,it is no justification for her brutal killing.
0551_1c502a8c-7776-4d52-9bfe-f14cf4d08940	Laura Aebi\nNews Reporter\n\n[caption id="attachment_20527" align="alignleft" width="169"] Photo by Laura Aebi[/caption]\n\nHundreds of people from San Marcos and neighboring cities came to celebrate equality this past Saturday, September 12, in the form of a parade, marriage ceremonies and musical performances.\n\nThe festival doubled its attendance this year.\n\nOne of the main events took place on the San Marcos Park Plaza Stage, where a drag show was hosted by Gia De Flor and Chitah Daniels Kennedy.\n\nThe ladies performed an “Age of Aquarius” lip-synch and dancing performance.\n\nSan Marcos native Stephanie Austin says it’s been a long process to get the city to this point of acceptance.\n\n“Growing up here, I never imagined that this would happen. I never imagined I would be performing in my hometown, like this. I mean, I knew what I wanted and I thought I would have to go to another place to do it. So, I had left because of that- but coming back and having all of this and the girls… It’s like a family really. But seeing it all come together- it’s so beautiful. There are no words to describe how amazing it all is.”\n\nThis year is especially important in history for LBGTQA history with the new federal gay marriage legislation, Austin said. The City of San Marcos and PRIDE came together to even incorporate a same-sex marriage ceremony into the PRIDE festivities.\n\n“I think this year has been an amazing year for PRIDE all across our nation. I mean, we’ve had miraculous events happen throughout the last couple of months and pride month. And um, I was telling the girls I’ve been going to a lot of prides across the state and to see so much of it everywhere is such a beautiful thing, to see everyone coming together and finally accepting who we truly are and what we’ve always celebrated.”\n\nIt all began when Sylvia Sandoval, the woman who began this process more than 5 years ago, started to try and organize a gay-night at local bars called “Rainbow Night”. The event was a hit in the LBGTQA community, but no local bars were willing to consistently hold the event.\n\nLuckily, on December 2nd of last year, that problem was solved with Stonewall Warehouse, San Marcos’ first gay bar. Now, they hold a drag show hosted by Gia De Flor the last saturday of every month.  De Flor, a Kyle native, says that the event is even drawing LGTBQA members from outside of the city.\n\n“Being a college town, we’ve always had people, I guess 50/50 of people that support and people that don’t. I think in the last 10 years, we’ve seen more voices come out and join together and be more united. I think that welcomes in all of the bigger cities in the area for Texas State, being a college town. It’s just wonderful for them to get here and see that something that they’re familiar with is also happening here, as it should. There should be events for everyone everywhere, so it’s really good to see that.”\n\nAnother queen performing in the show, Tanta LaStyx, thinks the annual event is something to be proud of, saying San Marcos is more progressive than some of it’s neighbors.\n\n“As a person who grew up in New Braunfels, Texas, which doesn’t have any type of gay community, it’s kind of amazing to see. I don’t know if you know this, but in the downtown of New Braunfels there’s a sign saying “Marriage is between one man and one woman” and that was only a couple months ago. Seeing that kind of irks me to the bone knowing i’m from there, so seeing something so close to New Braunfels on the total opposite makes me so happy. It feels good to be accepted especially in a place that you live, where you grew up. You don’t wanna look back on where you’re from and think “I live there…” you want to be proud of it and I am proud of San Marcos for stepping up its game.”\n\nPRIDE is a great opportunity to meet like-minded people in a festival environment, and the LGTBQA community and allies are welcome to get involved in next years event or see these ladies in action at the Drag Show Events held at Stonewall.

I could go on and on and on and throw Aretha Franklin in too." \n\n\t\t\t \nOn Tuesday Richards confirmed the Rolling Stones have made "definite plans" to record a new album. \n\nQuestioned about the band's return to the studio on the red carpet at the premiere, he said: "They aren't there yet but they are on their way." \n\nNeville, who won a best-documentary Oscar for 20 Feet From Stardom, his film about backup singers, said Richards is the ultimate subject for a music documentary. \n\n"He is about as archetypal rock and roll as you get and part of the film was about realising that there is more than that image of Keith, he is so much more than that. He is actually a living, breathing, smart, funny human being. \n\n\t\t\t \n"I discovered that he paints and I didn't know that, they are beautiful watercolours.

0553_2c590a96-adf1-48ba-8dac-76ea0fac43b9	Michael Reese and Jay Kinder recently hit two Amazon best-seller lists with the new book, “Top Dollar” \n\nFrisco, TX – September 3, 2015 – Michael Reese and Jay Kinder recently joined other leading real estate experts from around the world to co-author their new book So You Can Get Top Dollar For Your Home in Minimum Time. CelebrityPress™ - a leading business book publisher-- released the book on June 11, 2015. \n   \nOn the day of its release, Top Dollar r eached best-seller status in several Amazon categories – reaching #1 in the ‘Real Estate Sales’ category, #8 in the ‘Buying and Selling Homes’ category, and achieving best seller status in the ‘Real Estate’ and ‘Small Business and Entrepreneurship’ categories. Michael Reese contributed a chapter titled ‘The Power in the Right Price,” and Jay Kinder wrote “How To Turn Top Dollar Into Net Profit - The Single Page That Will Determine How Much Equity You Will Walk Away With When You Sell Your Home.” \n\nMore than 10 years ago luck and chance led to a reunion between Jay Kinder and Michael Reese one summer afternoon at Lake Texoma in Oklahoma. Real estate was the discussion of the day as a young Jay Kinder shared how he sold 233 homes the previous year to a receptive Michael Reese. Who knew that this chance encounter would turn into the wildly successful partnership that is now Kinder Reese Real Estate Advisors? \n\nSince that day, Michael, Jay, and their teams have sold more than 4,250 homes. Together, they have brought in more than $18,000,000 in commissions for their real estate businesses. \n\nBoth Jay and Michael have been members of Realtor Magazine’s prestigious “30 under 30” group. They have both been ranked in the Top 100 of the 400 most successful real estate teams in North America by The Wall Street Journal’s “Real Trends.” \n\nIndividually, Jay has established himself as one of the top agents in the world, selling more than 3,000 homes and capturing 14% market share in Lawton, Oklahoma. In 2007, Jay was named #2 in the world for Coldwell Banker, competing with over 120,000 realtors –the youngest to ever achieve this. The results don’t stop there; in 2007, Jay was ranked #1 in Oklahoma and #2 in the Southern Region, which includes over 1,700 realtors from 14 states. He was recognized as the #1 Sales Associate in Oklahoma between 2002 and 2010 before opening his new company, Jay Kinder Real Estate Experts in 2011. \n\n Michael has also enjoyed immense success as one of Keller Williams’ top 50 agents worldwide. His company, Michael Reese & Associates, is regularly ranked as one of the Top 5 teams in the Southwest Region for Keller Williams. He and his team recently broke the record for buyer sales for the Keller Williams branch he worked out of in Frisco, Texas – before going independent as the Michael Reese Home Selling Team. Michael earned $1,000,000 in GCI after only his third year in the business and he hasn’t made less since. \n\nCelebrityPress™ describes the book: \n\nIn this increasingly complex financial world, we try to make the most efficient use of our disposable income. In our western economy, we typically try to purchase assets as frugally as possible and sell them subsequently for as much as we can in the open market. Generally speaking, we try to obtain TOP DOLLAR for each item we sell. In the buying and selling of real estate, our homes rank up there as one of the most important transactions we will ever make financially and emotionally. Some of us may even purchase and sell several residences over the course of our lifetime. In addition, many people buy and sell houses as commodities, making them into income-producing investments and businesses. \n\nWhile some people manage their transactions on their own, most of us are ill-equipped to do so. It is for this reason that this book was written. The guidance of the CelebrityExperts® in this book will likely be eye-opening for those who may wish to sell or purchase real estate - and avoid any errors these experts encountered and discussed. It is for this reason we would not normally ask a doctor to represent us in a court of law, nor an attorney to perform surgery on us. \n\nThe CelebrityExperts® who have written this book discuss their areas of expertise and mentor you on them. They have both the experience and certifications to back up their presentations. In this day and age, it is only prudent to use the expertise of an experienced professional - one who can guide you through the maze of real estate transactions - in order to obtain the TOP DOLLAR for your property. \n\nAfter such a successful release, Michael and Jay will be recognized by The National Academy of Best-Selling Authors™, an organization that honors authors from many of the leading independent best-seller lists. \n\nClick HERE to order a copy of Top Dollar \n\nA portion of the royalties earned from Top Dollar will be given to the Entrepreneur’s International Foundation, a not for profit organization dedicated to creating unique launch campaigns to raise money and awareness for charitable causes. \n\nMore About Jay Kinder and Michael Reese: \n\nIn 2004, Jay and Michael started Kinder Reese Real Estate Partners with the aim of helping success-minded agents like themselves create the businesses and lifestyles that virtually every real estate agent dreams about. Kinder Reese currently serves more than 45,000 agents across North America with its revolutionary business model and innovative business systems. \n\nIn 2011, they co-founded the National Association of Expert Advisors® (NAEA), which offers the most prestigious designations that a real estate agent in today’s market can have. The Certified Home Selling Advisor® designee is one who has been recognized as an agent with a highly differentiated, proven, repeatable system to get sellers up to 18% more than the methods of average real estate agents. The NAEA’s goal is to provide the highest level of education, training, and business materials to agents who are truly serious about bringing the absolute best consumer experience to today’s home sellers and buyers. \n\nThe Certified Home Selling Advisor® designation is a four-part certification process that helps today’s real estate agents learn what they need to truly distinguish themselves from their competition and establish themselves as the true number one choice for real estate consumers in their marketplace. \n\nThey are both best-selling authors on Amazon’s top ten lists of books for small businesses with their book Trendsetters, and they can be seen on NBC, ABC, CBS, CNBC, and other major networks, and as Expert Advisors™ on the television show The New Masters of Real Estate. \n\nCurrently, Jay lives in Frisco, Texas, with his wife Amber and their three sons, Brayden, Karsen, and Riggs.

0554_8378f8e3-c575-4844-bea6-a9f3cd435add	Little Accidents,  2014. \n \nDirected by Sara Colangelo. \nStarring Elizabeth Banks, Jacob Loflands, Boyd Holbrook and Josh Lucas. \n \nSYNOPSIS: \n \nIn a small American town still living in the shadow of a terrible coal mine accident, the disappearance of a teenage boy draws together a surviving miner, the lonely wife of a mine executive, and a local boy in a web of secrets. \n \n\n \nAs far as exceedingly downbeat suburban dramas go, Little Accidents  feels particularly grim.  Writer/director Sara Colangelo’s film, derived from her own 2010 short, is set in the wake of a tragic mining collapse in a sleepy American town, which has seen an inquiry launched to determine whether it was an accident or foul play – placing the one reluctant survivor, Amus, right at the centre of both the investigation and a town tearing itself apart with secrets and lies. Meanwhile, following an altercation in the woods fuelled by illicit alcohol, a teenager goes missing, leading a town to launch missing persons search, a mother to grieve, and young Owen to hide the truth and fight a ferocious battle with his inner demons. \n \nWhich leads us to the most interesting aspect of the entire film. Played by one Jacob Lofland, who utterly excelled along side Tye Sheridan and Matthew McConaughey in Jeff Nichols’  Mud , Owen is a refreshingly engrossing character; no doubt thanks to Lofland’s complex performance, but also the fact that the character is so three-dimensional, written in such a way as to be sympathetic yet totally conflicting.  There’s so much clashing and rattling through his adolescent head as he struggles to keep a dark secret, crossing paths with those who hurt the most on his way to possible redemption.  If Inside Out had centred on this kid rather than Riley moving to a new school, suffice it to say, we would have been crying for a whole different reason. \n \nThe earlier comparison to Jeff Nichols’ bucolic and melancholic drama is no accident; the two share an obvious palette. The twilight visuals and existential themes, where our characters bear enormous emotional burdens while reflecting on their places within society, are one in the same; Lofland’s presence merely a black and white flag between the two. If you were a fan (and why shouldn’t you be), Little Accidents will have things to offer. The mere backdrop is seductive enough to leave the viewer happy at least on a visual level. \n \nYet where the film fails to work quite so well is in the marriage of the two ostensible plot lines. It can’t quite decide whether it wants to focus more on the one thing or the other; the industrial inquiry story or the missing persons aspect, and it ends up leaving us, the viewer, fumbling somewhere in between. There’s a striking amount of potential lacing every frame and dressing every character, but it needs more strength to its convictions if it’s to be as compelling as it so often threatens. You feel it needs a Jeff Nichols just to tighten up the knots and oil the creaks.  To give it a more solid direction. \n \nWith glum faces the cast is good enough to largely (and temporarily) pave over any such missteps – but they are still there. If compared with other, more accomplished works in the genre like the aforementioned  Mud , the brilliant Short Term 12,  or even the slightly more light-hearted The Kings Of Summer , Little Accidents begins to pale rather quickly; its lasting impression proving sadly weak and unsatisfying.  It’s interesting in measures, but unfocused, and brutally cheerless. \n \nFlickering Myth Rating – Film: ★ ★ ★ / Movie: ★ ★ \n \nEdward Gardiner – Follow me on Twitter \n \n[embedded content] \n Share this

"Parcels" was their code for the rabbits Ms Turner sold as live baits to greyhound owners and trainers.\n\n"What people do in their own backyards with their own dogs was not for me to pass judgment on," Ms Turner told the NSW Special Commission of Inquiry into greyhound racing on Tuesday.\n\nMs Turner said a man named Greg Hughes, the Bunny Boy, would trap rabbits in the bush around Goulburn and drop them round to Ms Turner's home in south-west Sydney.\n\nHer husband would wring the necks of some, wrap them in cling wrap and put them in the freezer. The others faced the worse fate of being mauled alive.\n\nMs Turner would ring up two trainers, known for legal reasons as Ms Y and Mr S, to tell them their parcels had arrived and they had better come over "straight away".\n\nSelling live baits, she told the commission in a previous hearing, was not a good look.\n\nTodd Fear, a western Sydney trainer, admitted to using live baits on about 15 occasions between 2012 and late last year at three separate training grounds near the Richmond and Londonderry areas. He said it was in the hope the dogs would "chase a bit faster".\n\nCommissioner Michael McHugh, QC, asked Mr Fear if he had done time trials to check his dogs ran faster after livebaiting.\n\nMr Fear had not.\n\nCounsel assisting the inquiry, Stephen Rushton, SC, asked the trainer how common livebaiting was.\n\n"Well, yeah, I don't know," Mr Fear replied. He was read evidence he gave at a previous, private hearing in which he described the practice as "rampant".\n\nAnother trainer, Adam Wallace, admitted to livebaiting his dogs, which he called "education". Wayne Smith, a friend of Mr Wallace's, said he had "blooded" dogs as young as three months in the hope they would chase faster.\n\n"Dogs don't eat the rabbits," he said. They lose interest after the kill.\n\nThe three men each said they expected 90 per cent of trainers in NSW had used livebaiting until the practice was exposed by the ABC's Four Corners program in February. A female trainer who live baited, Majella Ferguson, called the practice "extremely widespread".\n\nThe inquiry heard on Monday the industry's regulator, Greyhound Racing NSW, had known about livebaiting but kept it secret and did nothing to stamp it out.\n\nMr Rushton also read from a confidential memo by the Australian body Greyhounds Australasia this year, which estimated 13,000 to 17,000 greyhounds were killed in the country each year. Mr Rushton said he had seen no evidence to suggest the industry should not be banned. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

During a photo-op at the beginning of the session, the two men gripped each others' hands, smiling tightly as cameras clicked away, before quickly disappearing behind closed doors. \n\nDays ahead of their arrival in New York for the annual United Nations meeting, Obama and Putin's respective capitals were already exchanging barbs over the nature of the talks, their agenda and who had initially requested they happen. \n\nThat left little optimism the meeting between the men -- the first in two years -- would yield any tangible progress toward ending the crisis in Ukraine or resolving Syria's civil war. \n\nThe White House suggested last week that Putin was "desperate" for the ear of the American president and had been nudging the White House for a slot in Obama's schedule for weeks. \n\n"I think it is fair for you to say that based on the repeated requests we've seen from the Russians, that they are quite interested in having a conversation with President Obama," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. \n\nMoscow, meanwhile, insisted the meeting came at the request of the Americans -- who they claimed provided a list of possible dates. \n\nSo, too, was the meeting's agenda under dispute. Obama's aides asserted the focal point was Ukraine, and the entrenched Russian fighters on the country's eastern border. A secondary topic, they said, was the recent buildup of Russian troops and equipment in Syria. \n\nREAD: Obama hits Putin, Republicans in U.N. speech \n\nThe Kremlin argued the opposite: Syria would lead the meeting, claimed a spokesman for Putin. A discussion on Ukraine -- where the U.S. claims Russia violated international law -- would come only "if there is enough time." \n\n"There will be time," asserted Earnest last week. \n\nThe face-to-face meeting is the first time the two leaders have met since Russia's incursion into Ukraine aside from brief encounters on the sidelines of global summits in France and Australia. Obama, responding to the Ukraine crisis, has sought to isolate Putin, ousting him from the Group of Eight leading industrial nations and enlisting European countries to join in economic sanctions. \n\nBut even the White House admits the sanctions -- while exacting a significant toll on the Russian economy -- have done little to stop or reverse Putin's actions in Crimea, which he still controls. \n\nThe intractable situation left the Obama administration divided on whether engaging Putin after two years was a wise move. Secretary of State John Kerry was said to have pushed Obama to accept the meeting, arguing that skipping the talks could result in a missed opportunity. \n\n"It would be irresponsible to not have a face-to-face encounter and to not directly address with President Putin our positions and concerns on these two issues," Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said last week. \n\nWhile U.S. officials say  they entered the meeting with Putin open-minded, there was little optimism the session would produce anything remotely close to a breakthrough. \n\nMore likely, said Earnest, will be another view of Putin's practiced disinterest when meeting with foreign leaders, citing his "now familiar pose of less-than-perfect posture and unbuttoned jacket, and knees spread far apart, to convey a particular image." \n\nThat image was avoided Monday: with cameras present, there were no chairs for slouching down in sight.
0557_f3df087c-8bf5-4c17-ac20-eb7b199f9300	You will find Vrede en Lust nestled in the foothills of Simonsberg, in South Africa’s Franschhoek Valley. The name is derived from the Dutch: ‘Peace and Passion’ and this modern boutique wine farm is home to a winery, a country bistro and deli, a historic manor house and a wedding and function venue. Current owners, brothers Dana and Etienne Buys, acquired Vrede en Lust in 1996, with a grand vision in mind: that it would become one of the loved wine farms in South Africa. \n\nIndeed, we sat and talked about Vrede en Lust for hours, when we paid the farm a visit. The farm is a rich tapestry of family histories and legends, dating back over 300 years. Such stories are passionately reflected in the wines; each unique in personality. \n\nDana and Etienne, in collaboration with 2007 Landbou Weekblad Woman Winemaker of the Year, Susan Erasmus, worked to renew the wine farm, in order to realize the potential of the land; and with remarkable results. Vrede en Lust now boasts an award winning range of wines, and highly regarded country bistro and deli, Cotage Fromage. \n\n“This land is the most beautiful place and truly African” – The first owner, Jacques de Savoye \n\nVrede en Lust was first established by Jacques de Savoye, a protestant who arrived with the Huguenots in 1688. He described the land as ‘the most beautiful place’ and ‘truly African’ and had grown 10 000 vines, by 1691. Although the land was started as a wine farm, it saw 17 different owners over the years and even spent some of its time as a fruit farm. Nevertheless, the land has always been family owned and managed, with strong ties and noble histories. \n\nDana, with an IT background and Etienne, a viticulturalist, have done nothing to break this tradition. Not only do they reside here with their families, who are all involved in some way, but they actively celebrate the wine farm’s rich history. \n\n“There’s a couch in the Winelands with your name on it”- Dana’s wife, Anneke \n\nMuch like the idyllic mountain ranges within which the wine farm is set, Vrede en Lust’s Wine Plaza is earthy and elegant, characterized by family photographs, fresh orchids, fireplaces, couches and passionate reds. Visitors feel at home and relaxed, in a place that is testament to Anneke’s warm personality. \n\nVrede en Lust is a family orientated wine farm that does not aim to exclude and prides itself on a good customer experience. Visitors include children, students, connoisseurs and professionals alike. Wine is something people tend to get into with age, which is why they try not to exclude younger visitors (after all, youth will inevitably be older one day). Vrede en Lust wants people that aren’t familiar with wine to re-emerge, having learnt a thing or two and walk away with a passion-filled experience. \n\nThe women (and man) behind the wine \n\nVrede en Lust produces the bulk of it’s grapes on it’s three vineyards, Vrede en Lust, Ricton and Casey’s Ridge, and the balance is sourced from quality grape growers in the region. The philosophy is simple – high quality, honest wines that are handcrafted onsite. \n\nMarguerite Chardonnay 2009, has been aged in a selection of different aged barrels so the oak is in not intrusive, which gives it a beautiful balance between fruit and oak. Marguerite was, in fact, Jacques de Savoye’s eldest daughter. The free spirited, French Aristocrat, married a Bengal slave at the farm, which at the time was frowned upon. However, it turned out that the Bengal Slave was of royal blood, so she still stood to inherit the farm. Marguerite’s free spirit is captured in this wine. \n\nIn keeping with tradition, Dana has named wines in honour of his two daughters, as they have reached the age of 16. Jess Dry Rose 2010, named after his eldest daughter, is made from specific pinotage and shiraz grapes, with strong notes of strawberry and watermelon. New release, Sarah Chardonnay 2010, named after his youngest daughter, is easy drinking, light and crisp, with white pears and tropical fruits – it reminds one of youth. \n\nBoet Erasmus 2007, is in honour of Dana and Etienne’s grandfather, Boet Erasmus, is Vrede en Lust’s flagship wine. It’s a new world Bordeaux style blend; elegant and with layers of dark fruit, cigar box and a hint of spice. \n\nErasmus, a former vice president of the International Rugby Board and mayor of Port Elizabeth, played a major role in raising Buys brothers after their father died. He also loved wine and introduced them to fine wines. The Boet Erasmus 2007 has won numerous awards, the most prestigious being the trophy for Best South African Red Wine at the 2010 International Wine Challenge in London. \n\n“The bigger the blessing, the bigger the responsibility” – Boet Erasmus \n\nDana and Etienne live by their grandfather’s philosophy and are involved in charity work. They pledge to plant a tree for every 10 cases of wine sold, in conjunction with Trees for Life. This year alone, they aim to plant 4,000 trees. By planting the trees, they support the fight against global warming and climate change. \n\nWe had the pleasure of tasting these exquisite, easy drinking wines, along with the Sauvignon Blanc 2009, the Vioinier 2009 and the Mocholate Malbec 2009. Our tasting platter, from the deli, was a selection of cured meats, breads, cheeses, olives, chutneys and smoked salmon, that complemented the wine beautifully. \n\n“Indulging all of the five senses involves pairing the right food with your wine” – Janina Otto, fairly new to Vrede en Lust, yet already passionate about wine \n\nAs we walk around the grounds, we are introduced to Duncan Doherty, an event and catering expert who heads the sunny, Cotage Fromage. The restaurant, which Duncan tells us is especially nice during the summer months, is a combination of life’s greatest pleasures; food, wine and music. It’s an ideal stop for breakfast or lunch, serving light, sophisticated cuisine that changes seasonally. The restaurant offers live music on Sunday afternoons. \n\nThe adjoining deli can carry up to 60 different cheeses in season, which are sourced locally, from the Franschhoek Valley; and a selection of cured meats, chutneys and olive oil. The deli also has its own bakery with a variety of freshly baked breads. \n\nA weekend wedding affair \n\nVrede en Lust is often hired out for the whole weekend and can accommodate up to 140 guests at the Vineyard Terrace venue. Couples may wed under a gazebo, in gardens set amongst oak trees and overlooking mountain ranges, or in an old barn with rustic, oak beams. There is a tented area for lavish receptions and Vrede en Lust has an onsite wedding co-ordinator. \n\nA heritage site, the manor house and Jonkmans houses can accommodate up to 22 guests and marries old world charm with modern, breezy suites with a pool house that is perfect for braais. \n\nBy Lisa Nevitt \n\nVrede en Lust are open 7 days a week, from 10:00-17:00.

At the time of the Diamond Jubilee, Ipsos MORI showed Prince William was by far the most popular royal, well ahead of the Queen, with Prince Charles trailing far behind. \n \nDespite this, most Britons consistently say that Charles should not abdicate in favour of William – the only exceptions to this coming immediately following the death of Princess Diana and preceding Charles’ marriage to Camilla Parker-Bowles. \n \nSky Data’s survey also shows that the public is split on how William will fare as King in comparison with the current Queen, suggesting likeability is perhaps not the only thing expected of a monarch. \n \nIndeed, the royals are seen as more than mere celebrities – six out of ten people polled think the monarchy still plays an important role in the functioning of the British state. \n \nThe majority of Britons also trust the Queen more than most politicians. Given that politicians are consistently the least trusted group in society (narrowly trailing journalists) this is possibly unsurprising, but is perhaps damaging for those seeking an elected head of state. \n \nSky’s political analyst Harry Carr said: “Even following her notorious ‘annus horribilis’ and her fraught relationship with Princess Diana, the Queen herself and the monarchy in general have remained ever popular. \n \n“As we look back in history in celebrating the Queen’s landmark as Britain’s longest-serving monarch, these findings show the overwhelming popularity of retaining the monarchy not only now, but in perpetuity. \n \n“And with a popular new generation of royals coming to the fore in Princes William and Harry, the monarchy does appear to be in safe hands.” \n \nNot all Britons are thrilled with the notion of ever-lasting monarchy, however. \n \nOne in five think Britain should one day become a republic, with the same proportion saying that the monarchy is a waste of money. \n \nMention of the monarchy may also detract from the national anthem’s ability to unify the country, with 22% saying the anthem should be changed to one that does not make reference to the royal family. \n \nIf popular opinion holds sway, however, the Royal Family will indeed be long to reign over us. \n \n :: The Queen and the monarchy – key Sky Data stats \n \n:: 70% want Britain to ‘remain a monarchy forever’ \n \n:: 73% think the monarchy is an ‘integral part of British culture’ \n \n:: 58% trust the Queen ‘more than they trust most politicians’ \n \n:: 21% say the monarchy is a ‘waste of money’; 61% disagree \n \n:: 61% think the monarchy “still plays an important role in the functioning of the British state” \n \n :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,117 Sky customers online from 21-24 August this year.

0559_c4f4fb20-53b5-4df7-a30d-b77776c3df33	Johnny Depp attended the Venice Film Festival, where his latest opus, Black Mass , impressed audiences, but, as Vanity Fair reports, the real Whitey Bulger wasn’t the slightest bit interested in the film or in Depp’s requests to meet with him. In discussing his efforts in portraying Whitey accurately, Johnny revealed that he reached out to the real Whitey Bulger in the hopes of meeting with the convicted gangster. \n \nWhile it would seem that meeting a celebrity of Depp’s stature would be a welcome diversion to one serving two life sentences in a Sumterville, Florida, federal prison, Whitey apparently chose to decline the visit. \n \n“I asked to meet James Bulger through his attorney, Jay Carney,” Depp said. “And—as expected—I knew this wouldn’t happen, Bulger respectfully declined because I don’t believe he was a great fan of the book Black Mass …I also don’t believe he was a great fan of any of the books written about him.” \n \nWhile Johnny never realized his hope of gaining inspiration directly from Bulger, Depp does reveal that other sources were helpful in inspiring his Black Mass portrayal. \n \n“But Jay Carney was very helpful to me in finding James Bulger,” Depp continued. “First and foremost, he said, ‘I ain’t gonna say nothin’ that Jimmy wouldn’t want me to say. I will say this, and I’ll say this, but I won’t say anything over here.’ But Jay came to the set a couple of times and watched, and he gave me a lot of confidence because he said he could feel his old friend in what I was doing, which was a very high compliment.” \n \nJohnny was dedicated to presenting himself as Whitey in as accurate a manner as possible. F.B.I. surveillance tapes and audio recordings of Bulger helped Depp deliver the chilling performance seen in Black Mass . \n \n“It was very, very important to look as much like Jimmy Bulger as humanly possible,” the Black Mass actor said. “My eyeballs are black as the ace of spades, so clearly the blue contacts…they were hand-painted because they needed to be piercing, they needed to cut right through you.” \n \nWhile at the Venice Film Festival, Variety reports that Mr. Depp was asked if he found it difficult to step into such an evil character as is seen in Black Mass . \n \n“I found the evil in myself a long time ago. I accept it, we are old friends. But with James Bulger, I think you have to approach him as just a human being,” Johnny said. \n \nDepp added that transformations like the one seen in Black Mass are “very challenging, and I think that’s important as an actor, to test yourself, challenge yourself each time. Take the chance that you may actually fall flat on your face and look like a complete ass. That’s what I do for a living!” \n \n[Featured image: Johnny Depp courtesy of Ian Gavan/Getty Images] \n \nJohnny Depp Debuts ‘Black Mass,’ But Whitey Bulger Couldn’t Care Less is an article from: The Inquisitr News
0560_0e902fc4-039f-438c-b2d9-55a246876695	The 2015 edition of the BFI London Film Festival is set to celebrate feisty females, as festival director Clare Stewart declared it the “year of the strong woman”. \n \nAlongside opening film Suffragette, which stars Oscar-winner Meryl Streep as Emeline Pankhurst, and American Express gala Carol, featuring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as lesbian lovers, there are other films showing women in front on screen and behind the cameras. \n Carey Mulligan in Suffragette (Pathe/20th Century Fox) \n“It’s a strong year for strong roles for women across our headline galas. We have the great opportunity by opening with a stunning film like Suffragette to amplify the focus on what is happening for roles for women and girls, in terms of their representation in front of the camera,” she said. \n \n“Also, to look at the question of how women directors are currently faring as well. So we’ve chosen that as our focal point of our discussion in a year where we have a huge array of films on offer as ever.” \n \nWith more than 235 films being shown at this year’s event, and 45 films directed by female filmmakers, it can be hard to narrow down which ones to watch. \n \nHere are Clare’s top film recommendations for this year. \n   Promoted stories   \nSuffragette \n [embedded content] \nSuffragette, starring Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter, will kick off the opening night of the 2015 LFF with a star-studded premiere. \n \n“Suffragette is an urgent and compelling film – made by British women, about British women who changed the course of history and it is, quite simply, a film that everyone must see,” Clare said. \n \nThe film, which is directed by Sarah Gavron and written by The Iron Lady’s Abi Morgan, opens in cinemas on October 12. \n \nCarol \n [embedded content] \nDirected by Todd Haynes, Carol – starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as two women who fall in love in 1950s New York – will have its UK premiere on October 14. \n \nClare said: “Carol is a deeply romantic, emotionally honest love story and is also cinema at its most intoxicating and immaculate. It’s Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara falling in love.” \n \nThe film will open in cinemas on November 27. \n \nTrumbo \n [embedded content] \nJay Roach’s biopic about blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo is played out on the big screen here, with Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston as the titular character. \n \nHe is supported by Dame Helen Mirren as US gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and Diane Lane as Trumbo’s wife Cleo Fincher. \n \n“Diane Lane and Helen Mirren – one holding, the other attacking the fort – in our Accenture gala Trumbo. Diane plays the character who really holds the fort while Trumbo’s in the firing line and Helen plays a character who’s very much attacking Trumbo,” Clare said. \n \nThe film opens in cinemas on January 22, 2016. \n \nBrooklyn \n [embedded content] \nSaoirse Ronan takes the lead in John Crowley’s period drama, which has been written by Nick Hornby. The Irish star plays young Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey, who swaps her homegrown comforts for the intoxicating excitement of 1950s Brooklyn. \n \nClare said: “Saiorse Ronan gives such an extraordinary performance in the heart-wrenching film Brooklyn, which is based on the Colm Toibin novel.” \n \nBrooklyn, which also stars Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters, opens nationwide on November 6. \n \nThe Lady In The Van \n [embedded content] \nDame Maggie Smith portrays an eccentric homeless woman who parked her battered Bedford van in playwright Alan Bennett’s driveway – and then remained there for 15 years in the big-screen adaptation of his play. \n Dame Maggie Smith in The Lady In The Van (Sony Pictures) \nClare explained: “Maggie Smith is the irascible Miss Shepherd in The Lady In The Van, this woman of an indeterminate age who parks her van in Alan Bennett’s driveway and stays there for 15 years.” \n \nThe film, which also stars Alex Jennings and appearances by Dominic Cooper, James Corden and Jim Broadbent, opens in cinemas on November 13. \n \nSteve Jobs \n [embedded content] \nMichael Fassbender may play the late Apple co-founder, with Seth Rogen as his partner Steve Wozniak, in Danny Boyle’s biopic, but it is Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, a member of the original Mac team and the NeXT team, who steals the spotlight. \n \nClare said: “Kate Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman in the Steve Jobs biopic, which is the closing film for the festival. This is a really stunning performance – she is the person who can hold her own against that iconoclastic leader (Jobs).” \n \nSteve Jobs, which closes the festival on October 28, will open nationwide on November 13. \n \nHe Named Me Malala \n [embedded content] \nThere is no one quite as extraordinary as Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist and Nobel-prize laureate. \n \nDavis Guggenheim’s documentary about the 18-year-old, who was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen after speaking for the girls’ education in her region of Swat Valley in Pakistan. \n \nThe film opens nationwide on November 6. \n \nRoom \n [embedded content] \n“Lenny Abrahamson’s amazing Room is based on the story by Emma Donoghue, who also wrote the script,” Clare explained. \n \n“It’s an extraordinary performance by Brie Larson as a woman who’s been living in captivity and bringing up her child, who was birthed by her kidnapper,” Clare explained. \n \nThe big-screen adaptation, starring Jacob Tremblay as the young child Jacob, opens in cinemas nationwide on January 29, 2016. \n \nMake More Noise!

Photo: CFP \n\nGetting close to world leaders and top politicians is out of reach for most ordinary Chinese people, but not for the service staff at Beijing's Great Hall of the People. \n\nFor them, serving drinks to President Xi Jinping or US leader Barack Obama is just part of their everyday work.  \n\nHowever, getting a job there is no easy thing. The candidates have to meet height, eyesight and age requirements, and go through several rounds of rigorous physical and political background checks. \n\nThen they are greeted by a harsh and intensive training process before they are allowed to meet important political figures in person.  \n\nRigorous recruitment  \n\n"Service staff at the Great Hall of the People often serve foreign guests, so they have to be elegant and also meet certain height requirements," Qianjiang Evening News quoted an official responsible for the management of the Great Hall of the People as saying.  \n\nThe age limit for recruitment is between 17 and 21 and all candidates are required to have good eyesight. The height requirement for women is 1.67 meters and above, for men is 1.77 meters and above.  \n\nAfter the interview and health checks, candidates have to go through a thorough background check that also involves the candidates' family members.  \n\nThe recruitment regulations require that both staff members and their close relatives have clean criminal records, according to the report.  \n\nDue to the strict selection process, the enrollment ratio is quite low.  \n\nShu Siyu, 21, who went on to a Wuhan-based vocational college for air stewardess training, became one of the three lucky ones out of several hundred of candidates in 2013, the Wuhan Evening News reported.  \n\nHigh-intensity training  \n\nShu, who served guests at banquets during the APEC Summit in November 2014 and the massive military parade this September in Beijing, said that service personnel have to first undergo military training after being employed.  \n\nDuring her training, Shu wiped some 3,000 chairs and desks at the hall every day, and exercised her arm muscles, practiced carrying trays, standing and sitting postures. \n\nAfter she learnt to carry bricks with one hand for a long time, Shu now can stand still for three minutes while holding up three bricks with her left hand.  \n\n"There are strict standards for each of our actions and the layout of tableware. During important conferences and events, we practice pouring a cup of tea tens of thousands of times," Shu was quoted as saying by the Wuhan Evening News in Hubei Province.  \n\nTea sets and plates have to be precisely laid out, and teachers examine them using rulers and ropes, said Su Ning, who recalled her time serving in the hall in 2003, the Shenzhen Evening News reported. \n\nApart from training, Shu has to bear in mind the floor plan of the hall. She practices from 6:20 am to 10 pm every day, and only sleeps for two or three hours during big events. \n\nThe service staff are only allowed go outside of the hall once every month for a maximum of two hours, Shu said.  \n\nThey are not allowed to live outside their dormitories. The hall management team does not employ local Beijingers, as they fear that they might run back home and accidentally leak State secrets, Su said.  \n\nMale and female service members are separated in two dormitory buildings. Even though every resident of the building is a woman, Su said that they were not allowed to walk down the corridors wearing only nightgowns.  \n\nShu now is a regular employee for State banquets and big conferences, and she also assists in training new staff. Due to her busy schedule and enclosed life, she and many of her co-workers have no chance to date. \n\nAfter several years of work, many quit the job, Su said. She quit after four years of work, and now works as a DJ in a radio station.

I've never been out for this long before so getting the 90 minutes under my belt for the first game and coming out without any injuries is a big bonus for me." \nWatford Under-21 coach Harry Kewell fielded a strong line-up that also included Miguel Britos, Obbi Oulare and Victor Ibarbo, but his side lost 2-1.
0566_69eb3442-d032-4660-afe5-5020cbd8c101	MMAmania.com resident fighter analyst Andrew Richardson breaks down the mixed martial arts (MMA) game of UFC Fight Night 75 headliner Roy Nelson, who looks to return to the win column this Saturday night (Sept. 26, 2015) at Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. \nPortly knockout artist, Roy Nelson, is set to collide with former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Heavyweight champion, Josh Barnett, this Saturday night (Sept. 26, 2015) at UFC Fight Night 75 inside Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, I wrote a fighter breakdown on Nelson ahead of his bout with Mark Hunt, as the two big men headlined a different UFC Fight Night in Japan. Were I to copy and paste that article here, it would work almost perfectly and be extremely accurate in describing the fighter who will show up on Saturday night.\n\n"Big Country" simply hasn't evolved in the least.\n\nAt this point, Nelson's game -- which has been shockingly one-note and steadily unimpressive for literally years now -- is very well-known. Perhaps that's the reason he's lost four of his last five fights, with the lone victory coming over the barely moving and since-retired Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira.\n\nWith all that in mind, let's take a look at what "Big Country" brings to the table.\n\nStriking\n\nNelson is essentially a one-handed fighter. He relies almost entirely on his right hand and rarely deviates from his overhand. Most of the time Nelson is on his feet, he's either lining up the overhand or actively throwing it.\n\nDespite the absurd level of predictability, Nelson has secured 14 victories via knockout.\n\nWhen Nelson does use his lead hand, its sole purpose is lining up his right. Tossing out jabs, Nelson looks to gauge distance and force his opponent to circle into the right hand. He'll occasionally fire off a cross behind his jab(s), and he'll also use the left hook to really motivate his opponent to move into the path of his right hand.\n\nSince his opponent knows Nelson's chosen weapon -- and "Big Country" rarely diverts from it -- Nelson's ability to set up the strike is basically mandatory for him to pull off the victory. To his credit, he manages to line up his money punch quite well.\n\nOne of the best examples came in his bout with Cheick Kongo. Using takedown attempts and jabs to herd his opponent into the cage, Nelson quickly put his opponent in any uncomfortable position. Kongo resisted the urge to move into the right hand at first, but a few left hook feints had him switch directions before long.\n\nFrom there, Nelson's aim was true, and the muscular Frenchman crumpled to the mat.\n\nAnother of Nelson's preferred set ups is the cross counter. Looking for his opponent to jab, Nelson will come over the top of his opponent's outstretched lead hand with a far more powerful strike. This attack worked to great effect opposite Nogueira, who repeatedly looked to keep Nelson at bay with a slow jab. Worse still than the speed of the punch, Nogueira kept his feet firmly planted and didn't move his head as he jabbed, leaving Nelson with an easy target.\n\nIf those two strategies fail, Nelson runs out if ideas quickly. Before long, he'll just throw the overhand over and over, recklessly throwing an obvious power shot that any semi-capable fighter can avoid. While his determination is admirably, it often leads to him missing badly and getting countered even worse.\n\nSeriously, click HERE and look how confused Nelson becomes when Alistair Overeem covers up to block the overhand.\n\nWrestling\n\nNelson largely abandoned his wrestling after a terrible stand up from the referee cost him dearly against Andrei Arlovski. Outside of a few half-assed attempts to take his opponent's to the mat, Nelson hasn't really used his ground game in the last couple years.\n\nAll that said, Nelson's not a bad wrestler. Regardless of whether he's working in on his opponent's hips or in the clinch, Nelson keeps good position and pressure. As a short Heavyweight, he's often able to wrap up his opponent's hips with ease, and he will then look for the inside trip.\n\nNelson will also take a shot on occasion. Usually, he'll look for a single-leg takedown. If Nelson can get in on the hips -- which is a big if, as Nelson's shot isn't the fastest or particularly well set up -- he can finish more often than not. either by running the pipe or simply driving through his opponent.\n\nDefensively, Nelson is actually really solid. His low center of gravity is a definite advantage, as it's tough for the average heavyweight to get beneath him. Even when faced with a spectacular wrestler in Daniel Cormier, Nelson managed to defend a few shots and work back to his feet quickly when he was taken down.\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu\n\nA black belt under Renzo Gracie and former competitive grappler, Nelson is a very solid jiu-jitsu player. Unfortunately, his skill on the mat has largely gone to waste, as Nelson rarely bothers to take the fight to the ground.\n\nWhen Nelson does get on top of his opponents, his jiu-jitsu is fairly impressive. He's rather agile on the mat and can also power through his opponent's guard, too. In particular, Nelson's top pressure is excellent, as it's very difficult for his opponents to move from underneath him.\n\nThe most recent use of Nelson's jiu-jitsu came during his run on The Ultimate Fighter (TUF). Against fairly amateur competition -- including Kimbo Slice -- Nelson repeatedly took his opponent down and controlled from top position. Once he passed guard, Nelson would pin one of his opponent's arms down with his legs and hook the opposite armpit, securing the crucifix position. Using his belly to pin down his opponent, Nelson could then smack him with small punches until the referee had seen enough.\n\nWhen Nelson is taken down, he's not really an offensive grappler. However, he will use butterfly hooks to create space and scramble up to his feet quickly. He'll also kick off his opponent by placing his feet in the hips and exploding, once again giving him the room to spring back up.\n\nDefensively, there's a reason that Nelson has yet to be submitted in his mixed martial arts (MMA) career. Even when Fabricio Werdum took his back early in the first round, Nelson quickly freed one leg from his back control. Afterward, he kept his chin tucked and kept control of one of Werdum's arose, preventing the choke. Before long, Nelson had successfully worked back to his feet.\n\nBest Chance For Success\n\nAt this point in the article, Nelson's game plan should be abundantly clear. He's going to move around a bit, gauge the distance and then whip as many right hands as possible until Barnett is asleep or Nelson is gassed.\n\nReally, that's not a bad strategy. Barnett is certainly hittable, and Nelson has the power to put down just about anyone. Plus, "Big Country's" takedown defense should be good enough early on to keep from getting put on his back. It's a simple plan and also his only real option.\n\nBut, he just has to land once.\n\nWill Roy Nelson land another monstrous knockout, or will Josh Barnett be successful in his return to the Octagon?
0567_48e4f9e4-5005-4cc6-8115-0381f74b1bd0	Over 50% of nearly 600 surveyed bird species may lose more than half of their current geographic range across three climate change scenarios through the end of the century in North America, according to a study published September 2, 2015 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Gary Langham and colleagues from the National Audubon Society.  \nHuman-induced climate change is increasingly recognized as a fundamental driver of biological processes and patterns, and historically, climate shifts have led to shifts in the geographic ranges of many taxa. To better plan for potential effects due to climate change, scientists using the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Audubon Christmas Bird Count employed correlative distribution modeling, to assess geographic range shifts for nearly 600 North American bird species during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons under a range of future climate change scenarios through the end of the century. \n \nThe authors found that over 50% of bird species surveyed are projected to lose more than half of their current geographic range across three climate change scenarios. For over 120 species, loss occurs without range expansion; whereas for over 180 species, loss is coupled with potential to colonize new replacement range. The authors found that current conservation prioritizations do not correspond to their projected estimates of climate sensitivities. The authors suggest that these results demonstrate the need to include climate sensitives into current conservation planning and to develop adaptive management strategies that accommodate shrinking and shifting geographic ranges. \n \n"We were shocked to find that half of the bird species in North America are threatened with climate disruption," says Gary Langham, Chief Scientist at National Audubon. "Knowing which species are most vulnerable allows us to monitor them carefully, ask new questions, and take action to help avert the worst impacts for birds and people." \n \nSource: https://www.plos.org/
0568_d8154d4e-24c7-47ff-83a0-a6a0063e50ed	NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Among the most prominent questions for people who are considering a life abroad are what they might be missing from their previous lives and what could surprise them in moving to another country. \nBest Places in the World to Retire surveyed 400 expats recently on these issues in Expats: Expectations & Reality . The expats answered the question "What is the most surprising and/or interesting thing you discovered as an expat?" The answers varied, although some themes repeated. A number of expats spoke of personal growth and enrichment. Some respondents said they had learned to appreciate the slower-paced lifestyle and interesting backgrounds of other expats. \n\nBest Places in the World to Retire covers key issues about what it's like to live in Panama, Belize, Mexico , Nicaragua and beyond. The company distributes a regular online newsletter and relies on content and input from more than 500 contributors. Here are the four things that most surprised or interested expats about living abroad: \n\n\n 1. Personal Growth, Greater Perspective  \n \nSome respondents spoke of achieving a sense of accomplishment from overcoming the challenges of moving abroad. Some of them said that they had to solve problems with fewer or unfamiliar resources. "At a personal level, I've learned how resourceful and enterprising I am," said Sandie Davis, who moved to Panama from the U.S. \n\nDebbie, who moved from the U.S. to Nicaragua, echoed those sentiments. She wrote that she was able to "live without fear of the unknown. Jumping into a new life has given me courage and strength that I never knew I had." \n \nMoving abroad gave some expats a new perspective. One 45-64-year-old married, Canadian woman who has been working full-time in Panama , said that people are molded by the culture where they were born. \n\nMary Beth Strawn, an American living in Panama, said that she had not realized before how much alike people are because she had not been around people in significantly different circumstances and from different cultures. Moving overseas provided that opportunity. "We all have the same needs and many of the same dreams, goals, and desires," Strawn said. "Borders, nationalities, languages, etc. don't matter." \n \n      next   last »
0569_2a262ebb-7df4-41c2-bc84-635d8f4d131d	Jeb Bush will call for lighter regulation of the energy sector and for more local control of natural resources when he delivers his energy plan Tuesday at a natural gas company in Western Pennsylvania. \n \nThe Republican presidential candidate will also praise the advances of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking, a position that puts him in line with many in his party but squarely opposed to environmental activists. And he'll call for lifting restrictions on the export of crude oil and promote exporting natural gas to non-Free Trade Agreement countries such as Japan, China and the European Union. \n\nBush regularly touts the innovation of fracking on the campaign trail, describing it as part of an "energy revolution" that could significantly boost growth. His speech will takes place at Rice Energy, Inc., in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, an oil and gas company that gets some of its gas through fracking, and, according to the campaign, would benefit from Bush's policies. \n\nThe company and its subsidiaries have been subject to 121 violations with the state Department of Environmental Protection and amassed more than half a million dollars in fines since 2010, according to the Huffington Post. \n\nBush, the former governor of Florida, argues that companies like Rice face too many regulations, something he argues holds back energy growth. One of the biggest barriers by the federal government in his eyes is the Keystone XL pipeline, which would complete a 3,800-mile pipeline network that runs from Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. \n\nOpponents of the project cite environmental concerns and worries about the impact on tribal communities near the pipeline, but proponents, like Bush, say that the finished project would create thousands of jobs and contribute to economic output. \n\nHis campaign is publishing a preview of the speech on Medium Tuesday that hits President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton -- both of whom oppose the pipeline -- for holding up the project. \n\n"President Obama and Hillary Clinton have baldly politicized the government permitting process by opposing the Keystone XL pipeline," the post will read. "After seven years and an unprecedented level of environmental review, there is now no credible reason for the President to stand in the way of this privately funded project." \n\nIt's all part of what Bush considers federal overreach that limits state and tribal use of natural resources. Bush frequently criticizes Obama's use of executive orders to create new rules, like standards for carbon plants and limits on greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nHe also disagrees with the overwriting of state and tribal standards for hydraulic fracking and pledges to stop some of Obama's regulations "in their tracks." \n\nThe Medium post, however, makes no mention of the Obama administration giving approval to Shell earlier this year to drill in the Arctic waters off the coast of Alaska, a decision that angered environmental activists in Obama's base. \n\nInstead, the post focuses on Clinton, who made her first major break with the President while on the campaign trail by disagreeing with Obama's decision to allow Arctic drilling. \n\n"Even more extreme, Hillary Clinton has indicated she would flatly prohibit drilling off the northern coast of Alaska," the post will read.
0570_8ef2cd6a-0af0-4dde-aeb2-a6b85638bc38	The longtime University of Arkansas at Little Rock chancellor -- who guided the school through budget cuts, restructuring and enrollment declines -- will step down at the end of the fiscal year. Joel Anderson on Wednesday announced his retirement, set for June 30, after serving at the helm of the metropolitan university for the past 13 years. He has worked at the university for more than four decades, rising up the ranks from a political science assistant professor to the founding dean of the graduate school to provost. "To answer the inevitable question of "why now?," I think it should be sufficient to reply, after 45 years, why not?" Anderson said in a memorandum to the campus community. "But more seriously, the time is right because the institution has growing momentum. ... There will be more good news this year." Anderson notified University of Arkansas System President Donald Bobbitt of his impending retirement, along with the memo to the campus community. Bobbitt said in a statement that working with Anderson has been "one of the great honors and privileges of my professional career." "He has been a calm and productive leader for UALR, and it is clear from the length of his service to the institution that he has passion and concern for the students and the faculty who serve them," Bobbitt said in the statement. Anderson's announcement leaves the University of Arkansas System in search of leaders for three campuses, including one in Monticello and the flagship in Fayetteville. Bobbitt plans to put together a search committee in the coming weeks to find a replacement for Anderson, 73, who makes $219,406 annually. The system president wants to fill the position by July 1. In the meantime, Anderson plans to focus on his work for this academic year, he said. "The important work is to continue to solidify some of the changes we have made in recent years, both organizationally and in terms of recruitment of students and a variety of operations here on campus, which we're trying to make more efficient and more friendly to students," he said in an interview. "We're putting a great emphasis on retention practices, practices that help students remain in school and continue successfully through school." Anderson earned his bachelor's degree in political science at Harding University in Searcy and later earned a doctorate at the University of Michigan. While away from his home state, the Swifton native read up on the newly minted UALR in the Arkansas Gazette. "I remember saying to my wife that if we ever did get back to Arkansas, that's the place I would like to be," he said. A few years later, Anderson was in search of a job. And UALR was expanding and hiring. Aug. 20, 1971, was his first day, he remembered. Since then, he's filled leadership positions, such as when UALR professor, dean and state legislator Calvin Ledbetter was summoned to the Legislature. But Anderson's first real taste in administration came in 1977, as dean of the new graduate school. After another seven years, Anderson became provost. "Got to grow up with the place," he said, adding that he's seen a lot of changes. As chancellor, Anderson has finished several capital campaigns, including the Donaghey College of Engineering and Information Technology, the Donaldson Student Services Center, three residence halls and the Jack Stephens Center. The school also purchased the neighboring University Plaza shopping center. The university started the Institute on Race and Ethnicity, which seeks to move the city and state forward on racial and ethnic issues through education, research, dialogue, community events and reconciliation initiatives. The institute hosts an annual Racial Attitudes Conference. "I've been very much of the opinion that issues of race are the Little Rock community's No. 1 problem and the state's No. 1 problem," Anderson said. "I think we should continue working on that. I look forward to seeing it thrive and prosper through the years." Aside from the physical expansions, the university also brought 11 degree programs fully online and expanded doctoral programs. It's planning to open up an honors college next fall. Anderson has had tough times, too. "The university has just weathered three years of significant budget reductions and internal restructuring," Anderson said. "Everybody on campus experienced some feeling of stress and pressure because enrollment was declining." Nationwide, colleges and universities were experiencing the same troubles. At UALR, enrollment dropped from 13,176 students in the fall of 2010 to 11,645 students in 2014. Enrollment declines meant the university wasn't receiving as much tuition revenue, forcing the campus to tighten spending. UALR had undergone administrative changes and at the time was looking at its academic programs for cuts. The university cut $2.4 million from its five colleges and nonacademic units, instituted some hiring freezes and reviewed collaborations within the school and outside. Then, in May, things started looking up. The Windgate Charitable Foundation awarded the university $20.3 million for an applied arts and design building to house the arts in one station. The university received commitments from Little Rock and the state to improve University Avenue. Last month, UALR announced a partnership with eStem Public Charter Schools Inc. to move a high school from downtown Little Rock to the university's campus. This school year, the university ended its three-year enrollment decline. "He's accomplished a lot of stuff and will end on a high note," said Andrew Wright, an associate professor of systems engineering at UALR. "UALR from the time I got there to now has undergone a very significant transition. We were much smaller and had a much narrower focus. Now, we're much more of a full-service university." Wright, who also is president of the faculty senate, said he wasn't expecting the announcement Wednesday and was sad to hear the news. "I've known Joel for a very long time," Wright said. "He's been provost or chancellor for my entire career at UALR. This is a big change." After three hard years, Wright said, there's still work for faculty members and the university as a whole to round out. "We have more space to make decisions, and so I think that's comforting," he said. "It lets you catch your breath. I don't think we see this as a time to stop and say, 'We've made it.' We're seeing progress for the hard work we've done ... We need to keep pushing and get UALR to move forward." Connor Donovan, a student in international business, said he was conflicted by the news. It was nice to see that Anderson was leaving after so many years of "dedicated, compassionate service" for the university, he said. "At the same time, I don't want to see him go," said Donovan, 20, of Little Rock. "Whoever comes in is going to have a lot of good things left behind." Donovan said he worked closely with Anderson as vice president of the Student Government Association. Donovan's biggest focus has been promoting camaraderie and school spirit. Last year, when Donovan was studying abroad in China, the Donaghey Scholar created a Trojan fight song competition. Anderson gave $500 to the winner and helped to promote the competition, Donovan said. Through the tough times, Anderson grew more supportive of the Student Government Association and tried to promote school spirit, Donovan said. The retirement announcement also saddened UA System trustees. "There's a lot of disappointment," said Trustee Jane Rogers of Little Rock. "He has been a tremendous leader for UALR and has done so many good things. His leadership is invaluable." But she said she understands. "These chancellors work so hard for so many years," Rogers said. "They know what time is right." Anderson has expanded the role, scope and mission of UALR, said Trustee Morril Harriman of Little Rock. "Well, of course, you hate to see a chancellor such as Joel retire," Harriman said. "He has years and years of experience with UALR. He obviously loves that institution." What Anderson loves year in and year out is graduation. It's the biggest sense of accomplishment, the retiring chancellor said. "You see students dressed in their caps and gowns," he said. "As I sit there and watch them go across the stage, there's just an awful lot of excitement and enthusiasm. To get to see that is really satisfying." For Anderson, retirement -- though a year away -- means stepping away from the university completely. "One of the favors I need to do with the next chancellor is stay out of the new chancellor's way and not detract or complicate that person's life," he said. He plans to spend more time with his wife, Ann, his three sons and three daughters-in-law, two granddaughters and three grandsons.

If he had this in him, how can I trust him? How is he really our prophet?' \n\nWhen asked how many children she believed her father may have sexually assaulted, she said; 'I don't know?

0572_cac087ea-0f70-48db-b052-45fe875214c2	So I did the full TBD this time. I made the same mistake as last time where I came early to see a friend's band and got heatstroke and had to leave (on Saturday, to see Dusty Brown, who were rad). But this time instead of just going home I went to see Black Mass and came back. Black Mass is obviously a terrible name for this movie because every single person I've mentioned it to does not know what I'm talking about until I say it's the Johnny Depp gangster movie. That name just does not stick in anyone's mind. It's pretty good - Johnny Depp is very creepy. But Bulger is not that compelling of a gangster.   I realized that the whole deal with a festival is the different levels of VIP. That's because festivals are really not a great place to see music, but they are excellent for hanging out with friends and people watching (aka butt watching as there were sooooo many exposed butts to see). And drinking. So in order to do that, it's nice to be able to get to the shade that VIP has more of. And then there's the penultimate (yes I am using it right) level of VIP that has free beer and wine. I got in there a couple of times. The ultimate is the artist's lounge, which I never got to glimpse. There is also a viewing deck over the main stage which I could not access (I didn't try that hard). It was in full sun though so that didn't seem that great.   Highlights included the chef's demo with Thiemann and Matt Masera and the Hapa Ramen guy who was at the center of the huge food world scandal. Drinking lots of red heather kombucha from Zeal to stay hydrated. Ty Dolla Sign turning up. Death Grips. Riding the ferris wheel the first night while Tyler the Creator played. Butts.   The food was not as good this year. I ate Lowbrau sauages twice, but there wasn't a lot else that was appealing. The beer situation was weird because I'm assuming they had a contract with Anheiser Busch, who bought 10 Barrel Brewing from Bend, so that was the only craft beer. Well, that and Sudwerk Pilsner. It was rad to be able to get Bike Dog and Track 7 last year. I hope that comes back.   At various times, mostly because of the temperature or because none of my friends were there yet, I would feel like I was in hell, and other times I would feel like I was having the best time. So, TBD: kind of like life. With butts.

0576_b6b623ff-ffc0-4097-8f25-310f8de3fc94	Set against a backdrop of powerful hydraulic machines capable of raising many tons of dead weight, Wisconsin Gov. (and GOP presidential candidate) Scott Walker surely hoped for a similar boost to his sagging campaign Monday at XTreme Manufacturing in downtown Las Vegas. Plummeting in the polls, Walker returned to the theme that made him a hero to Wisconsin conservatives and the bane of organized labor. And this time Walker went, ahem, XTreme: He rolled out a plan to gut the National Labor Relations Board, end government unions and make right-to-work the law of the land. How a President Walker would get such monumental legislation through a constipated Congress so partisan it can’t agree on its three favorite American flag colors is anyone’s guess. But that wasn’t really the point. He was clearly trying to remind voters increasingly bedazzled by the Donald Trump circus that Scott Walker actually has a serious track record of fighting for conservative ideals. Walker reminded approximately 120 supporters he was unbowed by organized labor and was riding hard for the brand. (That’s the conservative brand, not the Koch Brothers brand.) Walker promised to give “power to the people — not the union bosses,” and “check the power of big-government special interests” in his blistering position paper. This is where Walker, a plain-spoken family man who reminds his audience that his kids went to public school, lives in the minds of American conservatives. His unabashed zeal to take on collective bargaining laws and endorse right-to-work issues endeared him with Wisconsin Republicans, vaulted him into national prominence and lifted him to the top of the polls among Iowa GOP caucusgoers in July. Since then, he’s faded like a bad dye job. A new Quinnipiac University poll placed Walker at 3 percent, down from 18 percent in July. Walker has been clipped in the political press for failing to take clear positions, or any position, on a number of fundamental issues. In today’s media, those flat lines and fumbles play in an endless loop. A candidate can be in err, but never in doubt. Walker has been hobbled by self-inflicted wounds. He also suffers from another serious malady. Walker has been, in a word, boring. Forget that he hasn’t been as outrageous as Trump. He plain failed to distinguish himself in the first GOP debate. A candidate who once held the genuine promise of a conservative underdog not of the ruling class now is making people wonder whether he’s ready for prime time. As the friendly crowd disbursed, Walker paused between handshakes and selfies with supporters to take a few questions. “If people want someone who can wreak havoc on Washington, they need two things: being a leader who’s actually got real solutions, not just political talking points but real solutions. And the other big thing is, you’ve got to have a leader who’s been tested. Hiring a novice is not the answer. We’ve seen how that’s worked. We need somebody that’s been tested. We’ve been tested unlike anybody else.” Page 2 of 2 - On his way to tonight’s GOP presidential debate at the — will it be “hair apparent” Donald and the baker’s dozen dwarves? — Walker stopped off in Las Vegas to flex his anti-union muscles and remind people he’s a leader whose mettle has been tested. But if he’d hoped for a street protest by the Culinary Union or the Nevada State AFL-CIO, he was disappointed. Beyond making a couple terse remarks, AFL-CIO and Culinary leaders kept their troops off the sidewalk. No matter how you spell it, Walker is going to have to get even more extreme in the days ahead if he’s to recapture voters with short attention spans and an aversion to heavy lifting. John L. Smith’s column appears Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Reach him at 702 383-0295, or jsmith@reviewjournal.com. On Twitter: @jlnevadasmith.

With Chinese President Xi Jinping set to visit Washington next week, Obama said at a conference with business leaders that his talks with Xi would include cybersecurity, a topic that has become a point of friction in U.S.-Chinese relations. A person briefed on the White House's thinking said on Tuesday the United States does not plan to impose sanctions on Chinese entities for economic cyber attacks ahead of Xi's visit to avoid what would be seen as a diplomatic disaster.

0580_e460b974-91c2-462b-9392-eef47d712444	A four-day training camp at Lleyton Hewitt's $4 million Bahamas mansion provided Nick Kyrgios with the private sanctuary he needed to escape the headlines in preparation for the US Open.\n\nInitially Kyrgios had decided he would head to Kansas with close friend, American Jack Sock, in the lead up to the final grand slam of the year in New York.\n\nHowever an invitation from the retiring Australian legend, who has taken on a mentoring role with the 20-year-old, to join him at his Old Fort Bay mansion in the Bahamas was too good of an offer to refuse.\n\nHewitt, one-time bad-boy of Australian tennis himself, has plenty of experience in overcoming adversity and rebuilding his image having polarised the nation just like Kyrgios has done over the past 12 months.\n\nKyrgios, who will take on Andy Murray in the first round (Wednesday 9am AEST) has been in the headlines since his "Kokkinakis banged your girlfriend" sledge aimed at Stan Wawrinka last month, but he managed to escape the spotlight at Hewitt's family home. if they are to play together.\n\nMixed in with regular practice sessions at a nearby tennis court, Kyrgios mingled with Hewitt's family in the crystal clear waters and engaged in a range of activities, including some sailing, table tennis and boxing with members of his team.\n\nBut the main focus of the trip was to fine-tune his game with Hewitt, who has been a positive influence on the troubled star of Australian tennis.\n\nWhile Kyrgios didn't sleep at Hewitt's home, the veteran organised accommodation for the Kyrgios camp - which included his brother Christos, agent John Morris and strength and conditioning coach, Matthew James.\n\nEven with Hewitt preparing for his final US Open campaign, his focus has been on ensuring Kyrgios is ready for what will be a tough assignment against Murray, who has a 3-0 record against the kid from Canberra.\n\nIt's understood Kyrgios has been weighed down by the criticism and negative publicity since Wimbledon and was able to recharge the batteries and clear his mind on the mini hiatus.\n\nKyrgios is yet to appoint a full time coach since parting ways with childhood coach Todd Larkham on the eve of Wimbledon, but Hewitt hasn't indicated whether he wants to take on the role permanently.\n\nHowever those close to the Kyrgios camp believe it will be beneficial to have Hewitt on board, not only as a coach, but more importantly as a role model and mentor.\n\nMurray has a close relationship with Kyrgios and fellow Aussie young gun Thanasi Kokkinakis, electing to practice with Kokkinakis on Sunday.\n\nHe's also fond of Kyrgios, and while he conceded the Australian has made some bad choices, believes there's plenty to like about him.\n\n"He's a young guy and we all make mistakes and everyone here when they were 19, 20 would have done some bad things and made some mistakes," Murray said.\n\n"For him, it's unfortunate that's its happening in front of millions of millions of people. And I think it's wrong, a lot of the things that he's done, but I also think that he's still young, and everyone's different. People mature and grow up at different rates. Not everyone's exactly the same. Everyone is different.\n\n"He'll learn, and I don't think he's a bad guy. I don't think he's a bad person at all. He's an unbelievably talented guy with a lot of potential. He's going to be around the top of the game for a while. I just think a little bit of patience is important when it comes to Nick because he's a young guy and it isn't easy growing up in the spotlight."

0582_94e5ff5b-1c34-41ef-a4e8-53311e5ec880	Bryn Merrick, former bassist for seminal British punk band The Damned, has died, after years of battling throat cancer. He was 56-years-old, and leaves behind three children, daughter Ella, and sons Christian and Richard. \n \nBryn got his start in the music world playing for the Cardiff, England-based punk band Victimize. In 1983, he joined The Damned, replacing bassist Paul Gray. Gray had taken over for bassist Algy Ward in 1980, who had, in turn, supplanted original bassist Captain Sensible who switched to guitar in 1978. \n \nAccording to Classic Rock , who spoke with Captain Sensible after Merrick’s death, though Sensible and Bryn Merrick never played in the band together, the two knew each other and were good friends. Sensible had the chance to speak with Bryn before his death. \n \n“I called on Thursday, letting him know he was much loved in Damned circles and thanking him for his important part in the band’s history. But hearing the news that he’d died just before we hit the stage at Chicago Riot Fest was still a real shocker. Our set was thus dedicated to the great man, just before we played his fave song, Ignite . Bryn liked the fast stuff – it was the way he lived his life.” \n \nIn the five years before his death, Bryn Merrick played bass in a Ramones tribute band called the Shamones, in which his alter ego was Bee Bee Shamone (modelled after real Ramones bassist, the late Dee Dee Ramone). Shamones bandmate Andy Johnson announced Merrick’s death on his Facebook page on September 12, reports Loudwire . \n \n“On behalf of his daughter, Ella, and sons, Richard and Christian, it is with so much sadness that I announce that my best friend, Bryn Merrick, passed away peacefully this morning after a long battle with cancer at Llandough Hospital near Cardiff.” \n \nOn The Damned’s Facebook page, band members shared a post — written by director Wes Orshoski who had recently finished filming a documentary on the band — about Bryn Merrick’s death. Orshoski writes in his post about meeting Bryn for the first time, and about interviewing both Merrick and other former Damned bassist, Paul Gray, who was also diagnosed with throat cancer at the same time as Bryn. \n \n“I met Bryn in Cardiff a couple years ago through his former bandmate and lifelong friend Andy Johnson. Bryn was really rather off the grid at the time, and Andy connected us for the Damned film. I immediately loved the guy. Full of life and love, smiling and joking, and just radiating warmth. A working class guy who loved music, and, like me, loved the Ramones.” \n \nThough Bryn Merrick has died, his legacy will live on not only in the children he left behind, but in the music he played; in every song that he put a part of his soul into through his pounding bass licks. \n \n[Image Credit: Classic Rock ] \n \nBryn Merrick Dies: Former Bassist For Punk Band ‘The Damned’ Succumbs To Cancer, He Was 56 is an article from: The Inquisitr News
0583_dffdd695-291c-434b-a267-f0fc182886dd	  FBI: Long Island Investment Fund Manager Sentenced to Six Years in Prison for Operating a $17 Million Ponzi Scheme \n       \n Earlier today at the federal courthouse in Central Islip, New York, James Peister was sentenced to six years in prison and three years of supervised release, following his November 10, 2014 guilty plea to committing securities fraud for defrauding 74 investors of $17.9 million by operating a Ponzi scheme. As part of the sentence, Peister was ordered to pay $9,657,218.65 in restitution to the victims of his fraud and $17.9 million in forfeiture, which includes his residence in St. James, New York, and his Hummer sports utility vehicle. The sentence was announced by Kelly T Currie, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Diego Rodriguez, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI). \n“For nearly a decade, Peister lulled his victims into a false sense of security through empty promises of reliable growth and conservative investing. After stealing millions of dollars in inheritances and retirement savings, Peister now faces his own retirement in prison while his victims struggle to rebuild their lives,” stated Acting United States Attorney Currie. “Would-be fraudsters take note that you, like Peister, who prey on the investing public will be held accountable.” Mr Currie thanked the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for their cooperation and assistance. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Rodriguez stated, “Today’s sentencing marks a closing for Peister’s $17 million Ponzi scheme, although for his victims, who lost their inheritance and retirement savings, there is no closure that can make them whole again. \n\nThe FBI is committed to investigating and bringing to justice those who prey upon trusting individuals for their own personal gain.” Between January 2000 and June 2009, Peister raised more than $17 million from at least 74 investors in connection with an investment fund that he managed. He had assured those investors that their money would be invested safely in a variety of securities, including stocks, futures, and fixed income instruments. Instead of investing the money as he had promised, Peister misappropriated the money to run a Ponzi scheme. Among other things, he used the investors’ money to pay millions of dollars in redemptions to his victim investors to keep the scheme afloat and to purchase luxury items such as an expensive estate in St. \n\nJames and a Hummer luxury vehicle. To avoid detection and continue the scheme, Peister sent phony account statements to investors that falsely showed that their funds were invested and performing well and submitted bogus financial statements to the investment fund’s independent auditor. As a result, investors believed that the funds were performing satisfactorily, and they continued to invest their money with Peister. Peister’s Ponzi scheme collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, when he could no longer keep up with demands for redemptions from nervous investors. \n\nThis prosecution was the result of efforts by President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 United States Attorneys’ Offices and state and local partners, it’s the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory, and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Since fiscal year 2009, the Justice Department has filed over 18,000 financial fraud cases against more than 25,000 defendants. \n\nFor more information on the task force, visit http://www.StopFraud.gov . The government’s case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Business and Securities Fraud Section.

0584_1e03254e-7513-40bd-84ed-92642c7edbc5	KWAITO singer Masheleni is furious because his kids were taken away from his home without his permission! \n\nMasheleni, real name Sibongiseni Nxumalo, alleged: “My one-month-old and seven-year-old kids were forcefully taken away from my home in KZN by Ukhozi FM presenter Ngizwe Mchunu and his wife, Lindi.” \n\nMasheleni is married to Lindi’s younger sister, Namani. He claimed his kids were taken to have rituals performed that he did not believe in. \n\n“Before my younger child was born, they threatened that my wife would have a stillborn baby if we did not do rituals,” he said. \n\n“I am married to Lindi but I don’t know what her siblings do. I am very busy,” Ngizwe said. \n\nLindi said she had not spoken to Masheleni for a year and she did not know why he was making such accusations. \n\nWhen he was asked why he didn’t lay a charge of kidnapping, Masheleni said it was because he was in Tshwane and the incident happened in KZN. His wife, Namani, alleged that Ngizwe and Lindi took her and the kids away from Masheleni’s home in Mbazwana, northern KZN. \n\n“They said mum was sick and I needed to come with them, but it was a lie. I am now staying at a friend’s house because I don’t think it’s safe to go home,” Namani said. \n\n“I do not know what my sister’s and brother-in-law’s plans are, but I will not let them perform a ritual on me or my children.” \n\nWhen the SunTeam visited Masheleni’s father, Joseph Nxumalo (54), he was furious. \n\n“I was not home when this happened, but Masheleni is keeping me updated. \n\n“I am still waiting for an explanation from my in-laws,” he said. \n\nA neighbour who did not want to be named said cops were seen forcefully taking Masheleni’s wife and kids away. \n\nNgizwe told the SunTeam that he did not even know who Masheleni was. \n\n“I was overseas. That person wants fame. You are just wasting your energy,” he said.

0586_26996cd7-73b1-49f1-a295-a2b97267952f	I’ve heard religion taught and grace preached.\nBut for many years the concept of grace was void of being able to help me understand how to live grace, in the tangledness of life.\nReligion was a list of rules. It was black or white. Right or wrong. Them and us.\nAnd grace, well, it didn't seem like a gift when the words preached built fences to keep some people in and others out. I thought Jesus was holding committee meetings in heaven about who had the correct doctrine. And there must be holy sub-committees who labored over deep issues such as music, how people should dress, programs, political association and other social issues of the day.\nThere were people, not so different from myself, messed up, carrying decades of burdens, trying to find the grace offered by Jesus, but who couldn't get past walls which held back hope.\nThere was always a lot of talk of grace, but it felt like barbed wire wrapped around my soul.\nWhen grace is taught only as a religious concept, it shows up in our dealings and interactions with others.\nJesus experienced this as He walked on this earth. \nThe very people God loved ––well they wanted their Messiah to come and save their people, but when He showed up they didn't like the way Grace looked. \nHe didn't fit inside their neatly established boxes.   \nThe Torah (the Law) pointed to the coming Messiah. The oral law was added, and strangely enough is still referred to as, "building a fence around the law."  \nBy the time Jesus arrived on the scene, "the fence" included 248 extra commandments and 365 additional prohibitions. \nThe oral law was intended to protect the Written Law. \nAs a former rancher, I well know the value of a fence and how it's expressed purpose is to protect by restricting access.\nWhat was intended to protect, became a stumbling block.\nJesus told the leaders of that day,  "You load people down with rules and regulations, nearly breaking their backs, but never lift even a finger to help." Luke 11:46\nThose people wanted to kill Jesus, because they felt they were the final authority on who had access to God.  \nHe broke their rules. He didn't play within the boundaries of  who, what, when, where and how their Messiah was suppose to do things.\nDespite the opinions of those leaders, the religious elite, the ones who had the keys to the church building, Jesus was scandalous in His love for others. \nHe was known to hang out with prostitutes, thieves, the passed-over, used up, the shunned, and the lowest-of -the-low in that society.  \nBecause Good News is mostly received by those who are used to bad news.\nJesus lived as an equal-opportunity-grace-extender and the religious men with their protective fences of rules, well they wanted to kill Him for it. In fact they did kill Him and that is how Grace became our Gift.\nJesus came knowing He would be rejected by the very ones He came to save. \nIt was true then and is still true today, men and women like to add incredible yokes of bondage and spiritual slavery to people. Perhaps, without meaning to, we can make claims to be the absolute authority of who should have access and who shouldn't. All while we miss the heart of those looking for Jesus, because we miss the very heart of Jesus Himself.\nNot everyone has an open heart for His wild grace.\nI came to my own crisis of faith. \nThe Jesus I read about, the One I wanted to live for, wasn't the One I saw people in church living. In fact it was all in direct conflict with each other. \nOne day I sat in a heap and told God and my husband, ".......if  religion and rules and arguments about doctrine is all Jesus is about, then I'm done with it."\nIt was  lifeless and above all loveless to me. \nCrazy thing.... the very same day I walked away from religion, Jesus showed up. \nGrace isn’t found within human lines. \nGrace is found in the fullness and abundance of Christ. \nGrace is a Person. \nGrace is what sets us apart from all other religion.\nFor by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,  not a result of works, so that no one may boast.  Ephesians 2: 8-9 Grace is simple in the fact that it is found in Christ alone. \nThat Savior, the One who created the entire universe, a macrocosm which cannot contain Him ––He is wild, complex and sets His own boundaries, which are wide and spacious.  Jesus is supreme and He is the One who establishes how far the oceans can go, the rising and setting of the sun.  He had a way of breaking people’s rules and turning over tables.  Jesus was and is famous for welcoming God-seekers that look more like castaways. He summons the weary and wrecked. The restless and the prodigal. \nHe didn't come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. \nGod’s law is to be INTERNALIZED. It isn't a set of external things we do or rules we keep. It changes us from the inside out ––truly it's upside down, to how rules and religion work.\nWe who love God, obey Him. Not out of coercion or boundaries set, but because of the great grace.\nHe doesn't tell us to get cleaned up and then come to Grace, He invites us to come and be changed by grace.\nWhat I know is that grace, His grace, has brought me salvation and much more. \nBecause of who Jesus is, the same grace that saves us, settles over all of our messy, cracked places and continues to mark and change us. Grace is a very multi-faceted thing. It is the Gift as well as the Restorer, Game Changer, Forgiver, Peace Maker, Rescuer, Giver of all good things.\nIt changes stone hearts into hearts of flesh.\nThe more time we spend with Grace the more we begin to look and live like grace.\nWhen we are living grace, it brings wild freedom and reckless passion. \nGrace gives us eyes to see things which graceless eyes cannot see. \nSuch as people who haven't got set free from their chains yet.\nI love our church and all the messy people in it. Together we are growing, pressing in, allowing more Grace into the places that still need,,,, more grace.\nThe authenticity of our faith will always, always, be marked by deeply warm grace. That is how we live this tangled messy life.\nLiving grace, not just talking about it. Let us live the kind of grace which invites all people to cross over the fence, to see what Jesus is really all about.
0587_dafeb6dc-72ff-4314-a77d-8d3c9ff8672f	Peter Debruge, Variety Media, LLC     \n\t\t\tPosted:  Monday, September 14, 2015, 8:34 PM    \n \nBy Peter Debruge \n \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - It's a tired old Hollywood cliche: Writer spends the entire movie trying to pound out either a decent screenplay or the great American novel, and just as he (or she) is about to give up, they ditch that project and decide to write something sincere instead. With "The Meddler," that's not the story in the movie, but the true story of the movie. While not a direct apology for her abominable directorial debut, "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World," writer-director Lorene Scafaria's sophomore feature returns to what works for her, drawing upon personal experience to deliver a heartfelt dramedy audiences are sure to appreciate. Bound to be among Sony Picture Classics' top 2016 performers, "The Meddler" serves as a lovely valentine not just to her mom, Gail, but to mothers everywhere -- including the luminous Susan Sarandon in a role that seems to come naturally. \n \nThough many actresses regret the moment they stop being considered for love-interest roles and instead start to be sent mother parts instead, Sarandon has actually delivered some of the best roles of her career in the latter mode ("Lorenzo's Oil," "Jeff, Who Lives at Home," Lonely Island's "Mother Lover" musicvideo). But "The Meddler" is an uncommonly special gift for the star, whose Marnie Minervini embodies both sides: matriarch and romantic lead, (s)mothering Scafaria's obvious screen proxy, Lori (Rose Byrne), while fending off the advances of two prospective suitors, played by J.K. Simmons and Michael McKean. \n \nNot every writer is fortunate enough to have a mother who serves as an ongoing source of material, and those who do nearly always go negative. It all comes down to whether the filmmaker in question can strike a tone that elevates what might have played like an agonizing therapy session into a specific and identifiable human story (the difference between, say, Albert Brooks' affectionately barbed "Mother" and Dustin Lance Black's tortured "Virginia"). \n   \nIn this case, while the title suggests Scafaria resents Gail sticking her nose into everybody's business (especially her own), Sarandon plays the character, Marnie Minervini, as such a well-meaning soul, it's clear the film will serve as more than just an excuse to complain. Far from it. Inspired by Gail's decision to move out to Los Angeles, after the death of her husband, where she could be closer to her showbiz-employed daughter, "The Meddler" feels less like venting than it does a collection of nearly incredible true stories, too good for Scafaria to have kept to herself. \n \nMarnie can be a bit simple when it comes to little things, like how to operate her new iPhone or when to respect other people's boundaries, although those shortcomings prove to be assets when viewed in the right light. Case in point: Her techno-deficiencies make Marnie a regular visitor at her local Apple Store, while her invasive curiosity leads to her motivating Genius Bar staffer Frank (Jerrod Carmichael) to pursue a law degree. Where anyone else might have stopped there, Marnie takes her involvement two steps farther, first offering to drive this near-stranger to class, and then downloading online courses so she can help him study. \n \nBlessed with a more-than-generous inheritance from her late husband, Marnie blends a guileless naivete with an instinctively generous spirit. When confronted with a problem, it's her instinct to help, which manifests itself in all sorts of heart-warming ways -- scenes that might seem corny if they didn't come from a place of truth. Like the $13,000 gay marriage she offers to underwrite for one of her daughter's friends (Gail really did suggest as much for Scafaria's pal -- and "The Meddler" producer -- Joy Gorman Wettels). \n \nWith no car chases or artificial villains to get in the way, and no treacly contrivances to force unearned emotions, the bright, vaguely sitcom-styled movie is free to make audiences feel good on its own genuine terms -- though in retrospect, it might be taking things a bit far to set this reluctant widow up with a Harley-riding ex-cop who serenades his pet chickens with Dolly Parton standards. As with Sarandon, it takes an actor of Simmons' caliber to make such a character seem as organic as the free-range eggs he raises. But that romantic subplot is a necessary one as well, and not just because Marnie has so much love to give either. \n \nWhile "The Meddler" is clearly an homage to Scafaria's mother, it's just as much about moving on after the death of her father, Joseph, an Italian immigrant who didn't live to witness his daughter's current success. And yet his very soul seems to inhabit the pic, appearing not just in old family photos but tenderly "resurrected" for a touching scene in which Marnie visits the Gotham set of her daughter's clearly autobiographical TV pilot. \n \nTo the extent that the film is therapeutic, Scafaria clearly wrote it as a way to process her and Gail's wildly different approaches to processing Joseph's passing -- going so far as to involve actual therapy sessions, in which mom decides to see the same shrink in hopes of hearing what Lori won't share with her directly. Scafaria can be hard on herself at times, as evidenced by the morose Byrne performance (she spends much of the movie taking her mother for granted while pining after an ex-b.f. played by Jason Ritter). Still, the self-critical approach is far preferable to painting herself as the victim, and despite the countless movies lecturing auds to "write what you know," far too few actually make it to the screen.
0588_5b8c895b-02d8-42da-824a-136be12e7a92	PORTLAND, OR --(Marketwired - September 29, 2015) - Urban Airship, the leading mobile engagement platform, today introduced Urban Airship Connect, the\n    industry's first solution that unlocks the full potential of real-time mobile information for every part of a business. Urban Airship Connect makes it simple for digital marketers and data teams\n    to select and stream granular mobile signals of customers' interests, preferences and intentions to any other business system, driving actions within marketing automation platforms, ad targeting\n    solutions, business intelligence systems, customer databases and more. Joined at launch by 10 partners with connections to more than 50 business systems, marketers and data analysts can put\n    mobile user-centric insights to work in minutes. \n \nMobile is the front door for businesses with mobile app usage pegged at five to 10 times higher than Web activity. However, the usefulness of the sheer volume of behavioral mobile data is limited\n    by existing approaches that rely on pre-defined reports, aggregate data or batch exports that lack both timeliness and the necessary granularity. \n  \n"Traditionally, marketers use analytics retrospectively to analyze highly structured customer and campaign data and apply what they learn to the next campaign or customer experience improvement\n  project. In a contextual marketing engine, you must apply analytics on the fly within the interaction cycle," (Forrester Research, Inc., The Power of Customer Context, 4/14/14). \n \nWith Urban Airship Connect, marketers and data analysts can easily zero in on the exact mobile insights necessary to drive automated and targeted actions in other systems. For example, businesses\n  can instantly: \n Send a persuasive win-back email the moment a user uninstalls an app  Notify a sales associate when a VIP customer is looking for answers in-store  Present a can't miss Facebook offer based on the product they just researched  Feed mobile campaign and audience data to BI solutions for cross-channel attribution and to understand mobile's ROI impact on the business  Send signals across a supply chain, as safety or inventory checks are being performed, to speed the flow of information and drive business efficiencies  \nUrban Airship Connect seamlessly ties the user journey together across any business system through a flexible user identification system using device IDs, user IDs, Apple's IDFA and Google's\n  Advertising ID, custom CRM identifiers, or other IDs, resulting in more accurate campaign attribution and personalization. \n \nExisting Urban Airship customers can simply "turn on" Urban Airship Connect, while new customers benefit from only needing a single SDK for both the broadest mobile engagement capabilities and\n  real-time mobile data streaming that enriches existing customer data and drives more effective targeting and automation for cross-channel marketing. \n \n"Mobile is the most personal, permission-based experience brands can have with customers, and now they have a powerful solution to use real-time behavioral insights as powerful triggers for actions\n  in any other system," said Brett Caine, president and CEO, Urban Airship. "Today, we are moving the mobile industry forward with a commitment to an open omnichannel approach where data freedom\n  empowers businesses to act with insight and benefit from prior investments in business systems." \n \n Availability \nUrban Airship Connect will be generally available in Q4 this year, including pre-built connectors to Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis, as well as\n  many other partner integrations including a new strategic partnership with mParticle. \n \nAn easy-to-use streaming API and server libraries ease custom integrations. For more information, visit https://www.urbanairship.com/products/connect or register for the webinar on October 6. \n \n Customer Quotes \n"Redbox uses numerous solutions to deliver a great digital experience to our customers, including Urban Airship and Adobe Marketing Cloud," said Kimberlie\n  Christen, senior manager, mobile strategy & innovation at Redbox. "With more than 60 percent of our online traffic coming through mobile channels, we see tremendous value in having real-time\n  mobile behavior data connected to our analytics and CRM systems for deeper analysis and to drive more relevant and targeted cross-channel marketing. Urban Airship Connect has the potential to help\n  us close the data gaps to further optimize our mobile marketing while continuing to personalize the mobile customer's experience." \n \n"Rhapsody is incredibly savvy when it comes to the knowledge around fans' musical preferences. We recently proved that value working with BandPage to send superfans band-specific notifications that\n  they responded to at 50X the rate of banner ads and 10X the rate of Facebook ads," said Greg Spils, director, traffic & demand at Rhapsody International. "Solutions like Urban Airship Connect\n  will make it even easier for analytics and algorithms to be applied to real-time mobile behavioral data and actioned across our channels." \n \n"Urban Airship Connect and its connections to other business systems will offer the ability to see and analyze, in real time, how people are using apps," said Matt Restivo, director of product\n  management, NHL. "This is going to change the way in which businesses interact with users, and understand usage patterns." \n \n Partner Quotes \n"We're excited to partner with Urban Airship and empower more of our joint customers with the ability to send triggered, more personalized engagements via\n  email," said Sameer Dholakia, CEO of SendGrid. "By coupling SendGrid Threads with Urban Airship's Mobile Engagement Platform and Urban Airship Connect, we will offer customers an unmatched\n  multi-channel experience across email, SMS, push notifications and in-app messaging." \n \n"The pace at which big data is expanding is unprecedented with mobile data as the top driver," said Ron Bodkin, president, Think Big, a Teradata company. "By melding highly customizable streams of\n  real-time mobile data from Urban Airship Connect with our data science expertise and industry-leading data analytics platforms, clients will be able to have near real-time visibility into the\n  impact mobile has on the business and power personalized omnichannel experiences." \n \n"The customer journey is no longer linear, as consumers engage with organizations across multiple devices and digital channels as they please," said Dominique LeBlond, SVP of product management,\n  SDL. "By tapping into Urban Airship Connect's real-time stream of mobile user insight, SDL customers will be able to take advantage of their customers' signals as they occur, enabling more\n  personalized and timely engagements." \n \n"Our ready-to-use integration with Urban Airship Connect gives our joint customers the flexibility to easily use any and all of their mobile campaign data to optimize advertising based on the\n  business goals and user actions that are important to them, whether that's zeroing in on users that authenticate and convert, or those most likely to become loyalists with high lifetime values,"\n  said Charles Manning, Kochava CEO. "Together, Kochava and Urban Airship are ushering in a new era of data freedom for real-time mobile attribution analytics and optimization." \n \n"Mobile offers the ultimate opportunity for advertisers to reach key audiences, wherever they are, with precisely targeted messages," said Micah Adler, president, CEO and founder of Fiksu. "Urban\n  Airship Connect makes it possible to meld real-time first-party data with our own massive collection of proprietary mobile data to address the entire customer journey, whether that's powering\n  re-engagement campaigns, maximizing customer lifetime value or engaging lookalike prospects." \n \n"Our company is focused on unifying user data from all marketing channels to power behavior-based segments that accelerate business results," said James McDermott, CEO and founder of Lytics. "Until\n  now the power of mobile data has largely gone unrealized due to approaches that limit its granularity and timeliness, which is why we are particularly excited to offer an out-of-the-box integration\n  with Urban Airship Connect." \n \n"Amplitude helps companies dive into cross-platform behavioral data to reveal deep, dynamic patterns of user behavior that are the key to company growth and user retention," said Spenser Skates,\n  Co-founder & CEO of Amplitude. "Urban Airship Connect's real-time stream, coupled with Amplitude's behavioral data, allows customers to understand their users' interests and drive engagement\n  via mobile." \n \n"Urban Airship Connect gives Roost an unprecedented view into mobile behavior that will power relevant and timely interactions between brands and their audience," said Casey Haakenson, CEO, Roost. \n \n"Companies have more data than they know what to do with, which is where Urban Airship Connect's highly customizable stream of mobile data, and our advanced machine-learning and real-time\n  predictive analytics, come into play," said Jaco Els, co-founder and CEO of Cubitic. "Together, we're making mobile big data and machine learning accessible to everyone, enabling businesses to\n  better focus their engagement efforts on customers most likely to convert or spend more or, conversely, are at risk of churning." \n \n"tray.io makes it easy to discover, create and deploy integrations with common cloud services, so that data and events in one service can be utilised in other systems," said Rich Waldron, CEO,\n  tray.io. "The flexibility and real-time data granularity of Urban Airship Connect, combined with our visual workflow editor, will open up a whole new world of insight driven actions that spans\n  companies' most important business systems." \n \n About Urban Airship \nUrban Airship is leading the movement of mobile innovators.

0590_5ecebf11-45b9-44ad-a276-d87747f20f49	BETHLEHEM, Pa. - \n\nMoravian College in Bethlehem is remembering the late DeLight Breidegam Jr. for his decades of "absolutely remarkable" dedication to the school.\n\nBreidegam, the founder of Berks County-based East Penn Manufacturing who died Wednesday, joined Moravian's Board of Trustees in 1978. While not a Moravian graduate, two of his children and three grandchildren attended the school.\n\nBreidegam is credited by the college for spearheading and supporting dynamic growth and improvement in its programs and facilities.\n\n"Delight has provided significant resources for infrastructure and scholarships at Moravian that have transformed not only the face of the campus, but the futures and lives of hundreds of our current students and graduates alike," said Bryon L. Grigsby, Moravian's president. "It is difficult to find a program or place at Moravian that has not been touched and renewed by DeLight Breidegam’s involvement and generosity."\n\nBreidegam's legacy is prominent on Moravian's campus, according to college officials, who noted that he led campaigns to fund the Timothy M. Breidegam Track at Steel Field and the Timothy M. Breidegam Fieldhouse, both dedicated to his son, a member of the 1978 class.\n\nBreidegam also established the Helen S. Breidegam R.N. Scholarship Fund in honor of his wife, the Timothy M. Breidegam Scholarship Fund in memory of the couple's son, and the Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz Scholarship Fund in memory of their daughter.\n\nMiksiewicz, a 1984 Moravian graduate, served as a trustee from 2008 until her tragic death in 2014.\n\nMoravian honored Breidegam with the honorary degrees of Doctor of Laws in 1995 and Doctor of Humane Letters in 2007, the same year in which he was granted the status of life trustee. His many contributions to Moravian were also recognized in 2012 at the Comenius Dinner at the Hotel Bethlehem.\n\nBreidegam founded East Penn with his father in 1946. He was 88 when he died Wednesday.
0591_78cab105-4959-436a-8dd8-e23d239da749	September 6, 2015 - 1:52PM\n\nMichael Lynch, Dushanbe\n\nYou'll never ever know if you never ever go.\n\nIt used to be an old slogan used by federal government tourism chiefs to persuade Australians to visit their own outback and see their own country.\n\nBut it's a motto that Brisbane midfielder Luke Brattan has adopted – only in his case with Europe as the destination – in the hope that his career might take him to unexpected levels.\n\nBrattan, a late call-up for Ange Postecoglou's Socceroo squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh and Tajakistan, was latterly of Brisbane Roar, the financially challenged former A-League champions whose future is now up in the air.\n\nThe English-born player invoked his right to quit the club as a free agent because of non-payment of superannuation and other benefits and although Roar has appealed against his move, Brattan is hopeful that his call-up to national team colours will prove the circuit breaker to help him leave Queensland and find a club in Europe.\n\nThere could hardly have been a better time for him to join the Socceroos squad.\n\n"I have enjoyed it thoroughly, I was a little bit nervous coming in to camp but the boys have been great, very welcoming. I couldn't have asked for a better playing group to join.\n\n"It was good for me to get out, it was perfect timing. I have been upfront all along with John (Brisbane coach John Aloisi) and Moorey (football manager Craig Moore) and they have been great about the whole thing.\n\n"It's not the football, it's the other side of the club that needs sorting out. This camp couldn't have come at a better time just to get my mind off things and concentrate on football."\n\nBrattan's father Gary was a Yorkshireman who played with Hull and Cambridge in England's lower leagues before moving to play with Heidelberg in the Australian NSL when Hull-born Luke was just six months old.\n\nBut the family moved up to Brisbane when Brattan was two,and he has developed in Queensland to the point where he is one of the A-League's most highly regarded holding midfielders.\n\nWhile he is looking for a route to Europe, it's not something he is bothered about while the team is preparing for Tuesday night's qualifier against the Tajiks in troubled Dushanbe.\n\n"I haven't heard from my agent since I have been in camp. I told them I don't want to hear anything until I finish the camp. I have had a couple of sniffs from Europe and that's where I want to progress and test my game."\n\nLast year Brattan was linked with English Championship club Brighton. Having a European passport is a huge advantage and Brighton are thought to be interested in him again.\n\nWhile a move overseas to a higher level league would help him pursue a place in the Socceroos midfield – one of the most hotly contested spots where there is strength in depth and plenty of competition – he doesn't necessarily believe that staying in the A-League inhibits anyone's chances.\n\n"Look at Matty McKay (the Roar captain and Socceroo stalwart). He's a veteran and he's in the A-League. So is Aaron Mooy, there are a couple of others too and that's a credit to the A-League at the moment.\n\n"Look at the players in the midfield at the moment.

0593_1dfbe79b-f41e-400a-9b1b-fa3e1ad1b7e9	HYDE PARK, Vt. -- He came bearing bad news to a town set for solar. \n\n"We have to abandon the project," said Dave Hallquist, CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative. \n\nSouth Hero pledged support for a 15-acre, 1.5-megawatt solar project. But now VEC can't do it. A wetland at the site raised environmental concerns. \n\nHallquist pitched another plan: a bigger, 50-acre project in a different location. VEC would partner with a big developer. \n\n  WCAX.COM Local Vermont News, Weather and Sports- \n\n"There are large solar developers who do a good job who can afford to take that kind of risk," he said. \n\nHallquist is known for striking deals, a smart businessman at the forefront of innovative energy projects. He's a respected leader, pitching in when the lights go out. He's also the town moderator in Hyde Park. And now he wants to be known as someone else. \n\n"Christine Hallquist is who I really am," he said. \n\nDave Hallquist is transgender-- basically born with a male body and a female mind. \n\n"I would never want to go to my grave knowing I didn't tell the world about this," he said. \n\nCBS affiliate WCAX in Vermont is sharing Hallquist's story. \n\nDave says the need to finally live the truth stems from a dark place, a place of suffering. He was bullied and beaten as a child by classmates and by nuns, who he says demanded an exorcism on the eighth-grader because he was different from the other boys. \n\n"I learned early on that it would not be acceptable to be Christine," he said. \n\n\nDave Hallquist is transgender. She is now going by Christine. \n\nCBS affiliate WCAX \n\n\nTo survive, he toughened up, started playing sports and hid what was happening in his head. \n\n"I learned to the play the role well and I've been playing it ever since," Dave said. \n\nIt worked. He fooled everyone in high school and college. And then he met Pat, the love of his life. The pair married two years later, though Dave kept the painful secret. \n\n"She's been amazingly supportive, but I'm not the person she married," he said. \n\nSeveral years after the wedding, Pat discovered Dave's hidden wardrobe of women's clothing. She was confused, confronted him and considered leaving. But eventually she chalked it up to a phase or a fetish, like cross-dressing just for fun, hoping it would pass. She stayed so long as no one else knew. \n\n"We were going to keep this secret to our grave," he said. \n\nShe allowed Dave to dress as Christine in private. Christine usually did so while playing the piano-- alone. Pat didn't want to see it. Then came three kids: two girls and a boy. \n\n"It's incredibly painful not to be your authentic self," Dave said. \n\n"I don't believe at all that transgender men and women have mental illness as a result of being transgender," Dr. Rachel Inker said. \n\n\nDave Hallquist with wife Pat. \n\nCBS affiliate WCAX \n\n\nInker is a medical doctor running the transgender care clinic at Burlington's Community Health Center. Three-hundred trans patients have come here over the last 10 years, people in their late teens to senior citizens. \n\n"People will often talk about years as early as childhood of feeling that they are not in the body they were intended to, that people don't see who they are," Inker said. "It can be a difficult process for people filled with loss, rejection, harassment." \n\nCounting the transgender population is challenging. The U.S. Census Bureau doesn't ask if someone is trans and the number isn't tracked by the CDC. And not everyone is out. But experts working with the trans community in Vermont estimate the population to be around 1,400. That means for every 440 people you pass on the street, one of them identifies as transgender. \n\n"There's so much shame, a lifetime of shame, lifetime of embarrassment, a lifetime of trying," Dave said. \n\nAfter years of hiding, even thoughts of suicide and periodic purging, tossing out his women's clothes, Dave couldn't live like that any longer. \n\n"You try and you try and you try, and at some point you realize, I can't fight this," he said. \n\nAbout five years ago, he told his kids. \n\n"At first there's obvious personal shock," son Derek said. \n\n"This is a person we've been around for 30 years of my life... who is completely changing into a different person and that's hard, and recognizing it's hard. But we keep coming back to the fact that we really love each other," daughter Kiersten said. \n\n\nDave Hallquist with family. \n\nCBS affiliate WCAX \n\n\nThe family stuck together. And Derek is documenting his father's transformation. But they all admit it's been tough and still is, especially now that Dave's transition is further along. He's taking estrogen and testosterone blockers. He's changing and going public with his new identity. \n\nOn one night -- a first outing for Christine with a group of trans women she met through the advocacy group Pride Center of Vermont. There's a new outfit for the occasion, makeup, hair and jewelry. And there's a bit of fashion advice from Pat, who's working to make peace with what's happening and still support the person she's loved for so long. \n\nNo nerves, just excitement for Christine during the hourlong ride from her Hyde Park home to Splash on the Burlington waterfront. \n\n"I feel happy," she said. \n\nQuickly, Christine found new friendships. Drinks turned into dinner and an invite for two of Christine's kids to join. \n\n"In fact, I prefer being out and hanging with Christine now. Because I can tell she's happy," Derek said. \n\nBut their hearts go out to their mom, Pat, back at home, who's struggling with the public revelation. \n\n"We all agreed we are super worried about mom," Derek said. \n\nThe whole family is in group therapy. The marriage, though, is in question. \n\n"We are very lucky in that we have had each other in this," Kiersten said. \n\nReporter Darren Perron: What's your biggest fear in coming out publicly? \n\n\nKiersten and Derek Hallquist, Christine's children. \n\nCBS affiliate WCAX. \n\n\nChristine Hallquist: My biggest fear now is for my wife and family and how they adjust... When you've loved and lived with someone for 35 plus years, forgive me, I'm going to cry... I love my wife dearly. Of course this is a struggle for transgender folks. \n\n"Deciding to transition takes an enormous amount of courage. It is not something that people do impulsively. It's often many years of struggling with gender dysphoria, a depression and discomfort from a body that they don't feel like is their own," Inker said. \n\n"Now I've allowed myself to be who I really am," Christine said. \n\nHormone therapy, surgeries to look more feminine or complete sexual reassignment surgery are options during transition. \n\n"Will I ever go all the way? I don't know," she said. \n\nChristine is not sure how far into her transition she'll go. \n\n"My brain believes I am a woman. I'm a woman. And I know that's really hard when you stare at someone like myself who has all the physical body parts of a man. You say, 'How can you be a woman? Get that out of your head! Get over it.' A lot of people say that. Sorry, I can't," Christine said. "It's who I am. I can't get over this." \n\nAt 59, that once scared little boy is becoming the woman she hoped and prayed to be. \n\nChristine Hallquist: Now that it's no longer a secret, it's incredibly peaceful. \n\nDarren Perron: So will we see Dave Hallquist in a suit and tie again? \n\nChristine Hallquist: Unfortunately, yes. Ha. That's my costume... Do I see someday walking into the Legislature as a woman? Maybe. I'd love to see that day. \n\nChristine Hallquist has now informed her board of directors at Vermont Electric Co-op and her employees. And it's gone well. She no longer worries about losing her job. However, she is concerned about some national utility boards she sits on and whether she'll be squeezed out because she's transgender. \n\nShe will send out a statewide press release Friday about her transition. And on Sunday, she will take part in Burlington's Pride Celebration as Christine. \n \n© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
0594_8f6c50b3-4229-4afb-b8c8-64832b2255f1	Why we need a lot more women at the top of consulting \nThis isn’t an article about needing a few more women at senior levels in consulting firms: most firms have achieved this, some – notably in the US – are now led by women. But it is an article about why a few women aren’t enough. \n \nI had a road-to-Damascus like moment recently, talking to some senior women partners in a Big Four firm. We collectively realised that while the proportion of women partners remained low, individual women partners tended to have a higher than average percentage of women working for them. Women, it seems, attract other women. And it’s a point that comes through again in recent research from Source Information Services in collaboration with nbi, a human capital consulting firm. \n \nTogether we interviewed almost 40 senior people in leading consulting firms around the world. One partner in Australia described how her early career had involved several occasions in which she’d had to choose between a relationship and her job (she chose the latter). Eventually married and with young children, she found herself working for a senior female partner alongside other women who were also juggling their home and business lives. “The partner didn’t have the best reputation internally, so it was her who reached out to us, rather than us choosing to work with her. But she created in my experience a uniquely supportive environment in which we all helped each other.” \n \nNo one was made to feel bad when they had a childcare issue or domestic crisis; everyone worked together. Another interview made a similar point: “If a senior woman is working part time, actually that is something that is desperately relevant for making women feel supported. Flexi-working is desperately relevant for women, and I can do that, I can help with advice and I’m a role model.” \n \nMore women at the top means more women lower down, because women who feel part of a supportive team are less likely to leave when they start juggling work and families. Crucially, they’re also working alongside people who recognise that work doesn’t come first: “I don’t have to sell my soul,” was the way one woman put it. \n \nThat’s important because our research has found that nine out of 10 clients of consulting firms would prefer to see more women in traditionally male dominated teams. Two thirds say that, if they had to choose between two consulting teams and all other factors were equal, they’d often or always hire the team that had more women. Consulting teams which have a greater proportion of women are seen by clients to be capable of delivering better quality solutions, relevant not only to the client’s own organisation but to those organisations’ end customers. Women, in other words, are perceived to help consulting teams to think more laterally and to consider the longer-term. They’re also seen to be faster at developing relationships, more gifted coaches, generally more efficient and better at gaining trust. \n \nYet of the people we spoke to in our latest research only one in 10 thought that there was a sufficient critical mass of women at the top of their organisation – certainly not enough to pull through the women beneath them, to keep women who might otherwise be tempted to leave (and two thirds of our interviewees say that consulting continues to be a difficult profession for women to work in). “At a recent partner conference, the support staff assumed I was a secretary, because almost all the partners were men,” said one woman partner. \n \nMore positively, many of our interviews felt that there’s less pressure on the women who do make it to the top to follow male blueprints of behaviour. “When I first started as a consultant, the very small number of women in senior positions were ball-breakers,” said one. “There are [now] many more models of how people can be effective and influential without having someone who is talking all the time or is super central within discussions.” \n \nWith the proportion of graduates entering the consulting industry now more evenly balanced between the genders, the next challenge is to ensure that the proportion of senior women goes up substantially. Solving that problem will go, our research suggests, a long way to ensuring that firms can retain their high-calibre female consultants at all levels – and keep their clients happy as well. \n \nThe authors of this article are Fiona Czerniawska, founder of Source Information Services and Sandra Guzman, Director of nbi, an international human capital consultancy.

0595_7ccac62e-ec66-4872-834f-359d2cec43b9	Some thoughts:\n\nThe SEP median forecasts for the next 3 years shows unemployment rates below NAIRU and inflation rates at or below 2%. This implies that the Fed has accepted a long term disinflationary impulse, a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve, or some combination. This seems right – the modeling work I’ve been doing suggests that we may only get a 1.5% headline inflation rate through the rest of the cycle.\n\nThe bigger question there is how it affects the Fed’s risk management perceptions. As it stands, the 5y average inflation rate is just 1.5%, the 30y breakeven is just 1.8%. A lower inflation rate and a lower inflation breakeven rate implicitly limits the Fed’s ability to reflate. With plenty of room for inflation to move above 2% and still maintain a long term average inflation of 2%, one could argue that the Fed may want to keep policy even easier than current projections.\n\nThe tightening in financial conditions since June is not yet apparent in the data. We have only seen tentative hints of it so far, such as the very weak Philly Fed print yesterday. The risk is that a weaker string of data over the next couple months causes the Fed to hold off for two more, rather than one more, quarter. Predicated on this, IMO the probability of a Dec vs March liftoff is roughly balanced.\n\nFOMC long run dots dropped 25bps to 3.5%. There is a bit more room, IMO, for it to fall further. This is broadly supportive of my view that fair value for the 30y point is around 3%.\n\nHistorical analogs suggest that for equities, we may see one more down move before resolving higher. Historically, instances involving this much technical and sentiment damage take 3 months or so to resolve. Some may interpret it as meaning that a Fed on hold is bearish for equities, but I wouldn’t agree with that, correlations notwithstanding. As I’ve noted previously, the key here is credit. Staring in mid 2014, and partly a result of low risk free rates, investment grade issuance increased sharply. The widening of credit spreads is obviously a risk negative, so optically it may appear that dovish central banks => wider spreads => risk off. But this is not a stable relationship. Credit spreads in some cases are already at recessionary levels. In fact, the last time financial conditions (Goldman’s measure) hit these levels were in 2010, when Fed easing clearly ultimately helped tighten spreads. Now, credit spreads have tightened a bit from the wides, but are still in the process of consolidating. However, if this pause ultimately results in an unexpected jump in issuance, it could ultimately prove a risk negative.\n\nThe move in the EUR has taken it near the highs of the year. In addition, 5y5y inflation forwards are now back to levels prevailing at the end of last year. (chart below) The next ECB meeting isn’t until October 22nd, so there could be a lot of changes by then, but the ECB members surely will have a lot to think about in the interim. They’ve already upped their stated limits of purchase sizes, and have been noting that they will do more if needed, so the question is whether that will be the case in a month. Fed Funds futures are now pricing in liftoff in May 2016, so that risk will clearly be discussed by Governing Council members. If US or EU data is weak in the interim, the probability of the ECB expanding QE will be reasonably high, IMO.\n\n\n\nThe FOMC drove corrections of a number of popular USD crosses and USD related trades. The positioning wash out will probably take a few more days to complete, but this should be a good opportunity to revisit key themes. The delay of liftoff does not change the longer term fundamental trends. A few examples include:\n\n\nUS growth (and hence eventually higher equity prices)\nEuropean growth (and hence equity prices)\nweaker Chinese commodities consumption (and hence Chinese Capex related assets)\nThe very long duration of many commodity supply sources means that the trends tend to last longer than almost anyone expect. A rough 1998 analog suggests further downside, still, for many commodities\nCurrent Accounts in several EM countries remain unsustainably negative, despite the contraction of domestic demand and hence imports. Many of these countries also have excess debt issues that remain unresolved\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is that we will start to see weaker growth as well as inflation prints following the summer events. Over the past several years, this has triggered easing from central banks globally. There are many reasons to expect a repeat of that through year end. As a result, it is probably dangerous to be excessively short or underweight financial assets in aggregate.

It's hard not to think about the not-quite-perfect analogy with the struggle between the Clintonians and the Sanders Wing of the Democratic Party here. (Here, the Progressives have already had some success in pulling the whole party towards a more forward thinking stance, and, it must be said, Sanders is not nearly as far to the left as Corbyn... for better or worse.\nMoney quote: "In short, the whole narrative about Labour's culpability for the economic crisis and the urgency of austerity is nonsense. But it is nonsense that was consistently reported by British media as fact. And all of Mr. Corbyn's rivals for Labour leadership bought fully into that conventional nonsense, in effect accepting the Conservative case that their party did a terrible job of managing the economy, which simply isn't true."\nIt's unusual to see someone making a convincing case that, for once, the US Media seems to be actually a little better at NOT reporting Right Wing propaganda as fact than the British media.\nHere

However, while being financially successful is a top priority for both, women business owners place meaningful work as a higher priority. Women owners want and need to be engaged in work that is personally satisfying and fulfilling. \n\n"Women owners are independent decision makers playing a key role in making choices for their business while making sure respect and ethics are at the core of their decision-making processes," says Jessie Shaw \n\nOn average, women owners work less hours (48.1) than male owners (52.8) per week and travel less often. Not surprisingly, women owners are more stressed, time pressured, and concerned about spending enough time with their families. These stressors are much more prevalent for women owners than their male peers. \n\nThe Business Journals SMB Insights paper is sourced from an extensive annual survey of a nationally representative sample of business owners, C-suite members and top management decision makers.

(Photo: 11Alive) \n\nATLANTA -- Those cool, crisp mornings mark the slide towards fall. As we prepare for what some forecasts are calling for a wetter-than-normal winter, we finally have the total costs from last winter. 11Alive News has learned the Georgia Department of Transportation spent a total of $8 million to keep roads clear during three separate events. \n\nCommuter Dude Jerry Carnes reports GDOT has made it clear they want to avoid a winter like we had almost two years ago when a couple of inches of snow put Atlanta in gridlock. \n\nThey're taking a more aggressive approach to any threat of winter weather. \n\n"It looked like a war zone," Pete Muntan told Carnes. He now has a unobstructed walk along Bald Ridge Marina Road, but last February he traveled home from Florida to find Forsyth County heavy with ice. \n\n"We've lived out this way fifteen years. It's the worst storm we've seen here. I hope we don't get it again," he said. \n\nAt least the path home was along state roads that were relatively clear thanks to a multi-million dollar effort by the state DOT.  The February storm that hit Muntan's neighborhood and other parts of north Georgia cost the DOT $5.8 million.  It was one of three storms that drove the DOT's winter price tag to over $8 million. \n\n"Did the taxpayer get their money's worth?" Carnes asked. \n\n"I think any taxpayer wants any state agency to be more proactive...and we've made steps to be more proactive," GDOT spokesperson Natalie Dale said. \n\nAfter the gridlock of 2014, GDOT committed more equipment and manpower to winter. \n\nA year later, the biggest cost for the statewide effort involved the use and maintenance of equipment. That total was $4.5 million.  Crews traveled from South Georgia into the metro area and northern Georgia.  The total cost of labor and overtime was $2.8 million.  Supplies like the brine, salt, and rock used to treat the roadways cost $826,000 during the three events. \n\nWhile Pete Muntan is surprised the price tag was so high, he's not complaining. \n\n"Much better than the snow jam of a few years ago...for sure," he said. \n\nFor the first time, the Department of Transportation aggressively treated the roadways with brine prior to each winter event.  They say that saved them money on other materials like salt and gravel. \n\nSnowjam: A look back in photos \n\nAutoplay \n\nShow Thumbnails \n\nShow Captions \nLast Slide Next Slide \nAutoplay \n\nShow Thumbnails \n\nShow Captions \nLast Slide Next Slide \nRead or Share this story: http://on.11alive.com/1KkzRCN
0600_59360d37-17f2-4dd8-800f-bd07a2a3ad9c	There was no reason for Corn Elder to try and pick up the ball that bounced his way. \n\nThe rain was coming down. The ball and field were both slippery. A mistake could've led to disaster. \n\nBut that seemingly mattered little to Elder, who scooped up the punt, and dodged Bethune-Cookman defenders to get into the end zone for what would have been a 70-yard touchdown were it not for a hand gesture by fellow returner Herb Waters that officials deemed a fair catch signal. \n \nFive possessions later, Elder snagged another punt in similar conditions, broke through the Wildcats' special teams unit a second time and scored on a 72-yard return to push Miami's lead to 31-0. \n\nWhile one play put points on the board and the other didn't, both showcased Elder's athleticism, athleticism that at one point, had the cornerback hoping to play two sports for the Hurricanes the way he did in high school. As a preps standout at Nashville's Ensworth School, Elder helped lead the Yellow Jackets to three state football titles and three state basketball championships. \n  \nBut his dream of playing two sports at Miami took a hit in 2013 when as a true freshman, Elder's football season ended late in the year when he had to have surgery to repair a torn meniscus. At the time of his injury, Elder was listed as a guard on the Hurricanes' basketball roster. He never played that year. \n\nAfter Miami's football team wrapped up its 2014 season, Elder made the effort to play basketball again, earning a spot on the Hurricanes' practice squad after a workout with Jim Larrañaga's team. \n \nBut less than a week later, Elder opted to set his sights solely on football, the work load of playing two high-intensity sports and taking care of his body proving a tougher challenge than he imagined. \n\n"I got to focus on football techniques, focus on getting my weight up, getting stronger and faster," Elder said. "Playing two sports was kind of hard. It wears down on your body. During the offseason, I need to rest my body and just work on getting stronger. I think it definitely helped and definitely elevated my game. … I just sat back and thought about it, talked to my mom about it and we decided to do what was best for me and focus on football. Two sports is a lot on your body, so I just wanted to focus on keeping my body healthy and get ready for this upcoming season." \n\nSo far, that decision has paid dividends for Elder and the Hurricanes, who will take on FAU on Friday. \n\nAlong with his standout special teams play that included three returns for 78 yards, Elder — who stepped in on special teams after injuries to Braxton Berrios and Stacy Coley — had three tackles, a sack, and a pass break-up against Bethune-Cookman. It was a solid start for Elder, who had 34 tackles last season. \n\nNow, the goal is for Elder to continue improving , while keeping the 5-foot-10, 183-pound junior healthy. \n\n"He's a great kid. He's a leader, quiet, unassuming … just a great kid. I can't say enough good things about him," Miami coach Al Golden said. "He has worked really hard, he's healthy now, he's stronger, has a great vertical. His lateral quickness is good. When we play him in the nickel spot, coming off the edge, he's very fast. He had two plays doing that the other day. … He's a playmaker when he's in there." \n\nAnd his sudden emergence as a special teams standout has made an impression on his teammates, several of whom couldn't help but smile when recounting his returns against the Wildcats — whether they counted on the scoreboard or not. \n\n"[Having] him return punts is going to be dangerous. We might get balls every time inside the 50 if they mess around and let him take one back. We might have to sit down and relax for a couple plays," Miami quarterback Malik Rosier laughed. "Having him back there as an explosive player really helps our offense." \n\nccabrera@tribpub.com ; Twitter @ChristyChirinos \n Copyright © 2015, Sun Sentinel
0601_05309423-2312-400d-8b6c-00db16aeca29	Campaigns & Elections Carson Flunks Test on the Constitution Jonathan S. Tobin 2015-09-21 Jonathan S. Tobin/Sept. 21, 2015\t40SharesFacebook Twitter Google+ Email Print ALike a chain reaction, the fallout from Donald Trump’s birther mania and anti-Muslim prejudice has affected one of his chief competitors. Trump was unrepentant about accepting a question at a New Hampshire town hall meeting whose premise was that that President Obama was a Muslim and Muslims, in general, were a problem in America. As I noted yesterday, Trump can’t pretend to be an innocent about any of this since. As the nation’s pre-eminent birther, he did as much as anyone to promote these canards. But when Dr. Ben Carson was asked about this kerfuffle on “Meet the Press” yesterday, he had an epic flub. Instead of deflecting a question about whether a president’s faith matters and pivoting to the issues he wants to highlight, Carson followed Trump down the rabbit hole and dug himself even deeper by saying that a Muslim should not be president. While he and his defenders have tried to blame the problem on NBC’s Chuck Todd for asking the question or to spin his way out of that unforced error, this gaffe reveals two things about Carson. One is that he doesn’t have a sophisticated grasp of the problem of Islamist terror that President Obama has largely bungled. The other is that his lack of political smarts is a distinct liability to his party. Let’s first dispense with the “gotcha question” excuse we’re hearing today in Carson’s defense. It’s the journalist’s job to ask tough and probing questions, including those that might embarrass politicians. It’s the politicians’ responsibility to answer those questions in a manner that is not inconsistent with their values as well to do so in a manner that doesn’t them look like idiots. Carson should have rejected the question about presidents and faith out of hand by merely saying that the Constitution makes clear there is no religious test for public office in this republic. Not to mention the fact that there are no Muslims running. If this very smart physician didn’t do that, it’s his fault, not Todd’s. If Carson was trying to say, as some of his friends are claiming today, that what he really meant was that an Islamist who supports terrorist movements or advocates of imposing Sharia law on the nation are not fit for the White House, he would have been on firmer ground. But he didn’t say that. He said “Muslims” per se should be banned without a qualifier. Oddly enough, Carson didn’t flub the birther question when it was posed to him rightly saying that he has no reason to doubt that Obama was born in the United States and is, as he says, a Christian. But, like Trump, who continues to double down on this distraction, Carson couldn’t keep his eye on the ball when it comes to questions about Islam. President Obama has done the nation a great disservice by steadfastly refusing to identify the key element driving those forces that are waging war on America. By continuing to claim that ISIS and al-Qaeda are merely extremists that are not Islamic, the administration has sent a confusing and counter-productive message. It is difficult to wage war on an enemy that is misidentified in this manner and that has undermined the fight against these terrorists. It’s also provided an explanation for why the U.S. effort is failing to make progress against the so-called caliphate despite the president’s pledge last year to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIS. But if leading Republican candidates don’t know the difference between Islamists and ordinary Muslims, how can they claim to do any better than Obama? Worries about Islamism and sharia law notwithstanding, there is also something profoundly troubling about a would-be chief executive that speaks at times as if he is unfamiliar with the Constitution that he would pledge to defend. It is not a matter of political correctness, as Trump asserts, to know the right answer to this sort of question. Nor is the fact that a Muslim extremist group like CAIR has gotten some free airtime from denouncing Carson means that he is in the right. No matter what we may think about some branches of Islam, the prohibition against religious tests is absolute and for any candidate to speak as if there is an exception is shameful. Conservatives can carp all they want about Democrats taking cheap shots on this issue, but they are right when they say that to speak of not accepting a Muslim president is morally equivalent to making the same kind of remarks about Catholics and Jews. In recent months, Carson’s soft-spoken tone and decency have masked his tendency to make gaffes. But the Carson who uttered this foolish and offensive line about Muslim presidents is the same person who once spoke of the Obama administration as morally equivalent to the Nazi regime. For all of his brilliance and good qualities, Carson is not ready for prime time and the reaction to his foot-in-mouth moment illustrates how much of a problem he would be as a nominee. As Marco Rubio rightly said when asked the same questions on the Sunday questions shows, Obama was born in this country and is a Christian, and Republicans should move on from this trap and keep focused on the real domestic and foreign policy issues on which Republicans can win. But so long as Trump and Carson provide liberals with this kind of fodder, that won’t happen. Serious conservatives should regard anyone who doesn’t recogniz this truth as having rendered themselves unfit for the presidency.Unlock this and every COMMENTARY article, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.Enjoy every new issue—either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.

0603_9a767b75-8847-485d-9f0f-0b5a7a0c0fc1	WASHINGTON , Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Today the American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) hosted a panel discussion in conjunction with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 45 th Annual Legislative Conference in Washington, DC , exploring the impact of regulation on the economy. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is set to finalize their proposal on the National Air Ambient Quality Standard on October 1 st , which will drastically lower standards for ground level ozone, inhibiting job growth and creation in metropolitan areas around the country. In fact, a study issued by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) earlier this year found that EPA's proposed rule would cut 1.4 million jobs annually across the country. \n\n"As President Obama focuses his energy on his Administration's legacy including addressing issues around reforming our criminal justice system, it's just as important that he remembers the need for good paying jobs and employment opportunities for communities of color," said Paula Jackson , president and CEO of the American Association of Blacks in Energy. "But unfortunately, some of the EPA's regulations such as the proposed ozone rule would hinder job and economic growth, especially in major metropolitan cities across the country." \n   \nDespite a steady decrease in ozone levels for the last three decades, the Administration is pushing for a new standard between 65 and 70 parts per billion. However, several communities have struggled to achieve the current standard of 75 parts per billion, of which the deadline to reach was this year.  Additionally, it was just this spring that the EPA finally provided guidance to states for the 2008 ozone standard. \n\n"There's no doubt that President Obama's leadership has brought a renewed focus to many major issues that plague urban America - one of which is a disproportionately high unemployment rate. The President's initiatives and policies have demonstrated his desire to uplift communities of color, but a regulation like the EPA's ozone proposal could hurt the very people that we are all seeking to help," said Columbia, South Carolina Mayor Steve Benjamin . "What has been called the costliest regulation in American history could potentially stunt job creation for people that need economic prosperity the most," he added. \n\nOther panelists from today's event included the chair of the AABE board of directors, George Williams , CEO of PMI Energy Solutions, Brenda Scott-Henry , director of the Department of Environmental and Green Urbanism for the City of Gary, Indiana, Khary Cauthen , senior director of Federal Relations for the American Petroleum Institute, and former Congressional Black Caucus member and Maryland Congressman, Albert Wynn . \n\nThe American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) is a national association of energy professionals founded and dedicated to ensure the input of African Americans and other minorities into the discussions and developments of energy policies regulations, R&D technologies, and environmental issues. \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aabe-proposed-epa-regulations-are-a-black-hole-for-metropolitan-areas-300145711.html \n\nSOURCE  American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE)

0606_34fdb082-a6ef-4b54-bd17-6f8f68acb4a4	A sunny autumn day may find Jay Arrowsmith DeCoux kicking up dust on a gravel road — his wife, Rose, riding shotgun and son, Ennis, in his car seat — as they travel a backwoods road outside Grand Marais, Minn., their car a small speck in a gigantic Technicolored forest. Shannon McKeeth winds along a river valley, marveling at the lost-in-time quality of quaint farms and historic sites cast in a golden light by autumn leaves. Marc Sather heads out in Bluff Country, where hardwoods glowing yellow and red carpet the bluff tops. To find the best spots for viewing fall color, we asked the experts: innkeepers from around the state who know their region well and relish sharing their finds with others. Gas prices are low. Trees promise full and gorgeous displays, healthy as they are from a mild summer. If ever there was a year to head out in search of autumn’s distinctive rainbow, this is it. Turn to G4 to learn where to go when those colors peak — in Grand Marais, Pengilly, Pequot Lakes, New Ulm and Preston. \n \nDrive #1: Grand Marais \n \nInnkeeper: Jay Arrowsmith DeCoux of Art House B&B. \n \nShoot for: Mid Sept. to early Oct. \n \nRoute: From Grand Marais, head north on the Gunflint Trail. Turn left on Devil Track Road, about 4 miles from town. Proceed 12 miles; the pavement ends and eventually the road dead-ends at Bally Creek Road. Take a right and drive another 3 miles. Where the road ends, you’ll find the trailhead to Eagle Mountain. \n \nWhy: DeCoux operated a canoe camp at the end of the Gunflint Trail and regularly runs trails up and down the North Shore, so it’s no surprise that his favorite fall drive culminates in a 3-mile hike. The drive offers nice sights, but the real beauty comes from heading up Eagle Mountain, the highest point in the state. Take your time with the 3½-mile (one way) hike — you’ll want to pause for the views. “You see for miles across valleys full of birch and maple and aspen. There are splashes of green from all the conifers,” DeCoux said. He suggests bringing a picnic lunch, and hanging out under pine trees whistling in the breeze. “There is really nothing else out there, which is part of what I like about it.” \n \nThe inn: The Art House B&B, run by DeCoux and his wife, Rose, is two blocks from Lake Superior and near downtown Grand Marais. Each of the four bedrooms has its own bath. Also available: a rehabbed 1975 Winnebago for $65 a night. Early autumn rates for rooms start at $85 (8 W. 7th Av., Grand Marais, Minn.; 1-218-370-1625; arthousebb@gmail.com). \n \nDrive #2: Pengilly \n \nInnkeeper: Sarah Master, Mr. Roberts Resort. \n \nShoot for: Mid Sept. to early Oct. \n \nRoute: From Pengilly, travel southwest on Hwy. 169 about 10 miles to Scenic Hwy. 7. The road leads to Big Forks, in the Edge of the Wilderness Area. \n \nWhy: There’s a reason why the word “Scenic” precedes “Hwy. 7.” It’s a densely forested area, “and you can veer off at points to see abandoned mine pits that are filled with this crazy crystal-blue water,” Master said. Adding to the colorful show are birch and aspen trees, whose yellows pop against the green of pines and balsam firs. Master also recommends a twirl around Swan Lake; Mr. Roberts Resort sits on a quiet bay along the southeast side. “There are tons of maples and birch on one side of the road; the lake side has lots of pines.” The trip around is 11 miles. \n \nThe inn: Mr. Roberts has garnered attention lately, since Master, who grew up in Pengilly, and her business partner, Dan Beckwith, bought the business. Master, a chef, helmed stoves in Minneapolis, New Orleans and on ABC’s “The Taste,” where she advanced to the semifinals, before returning to her hometown. Now she displays her talents in a cozy red clapboard bistro overlooking Swan Lake. The resort has four cabins and eight RV hookups. Also on site: games, grills, fire pits, a sauna — and North Woods charm. Rates start at $50 a night for a cabin (28179 East Shore Dr., Pengilly, Minn.; 1-218-215-2015; mrrobertsresort.com). \n \nDrive #3: Pequot Lakes \n \nInnkeeper: Dick Frieler of Oliver Acreage. \n \nShoot for: Late Sept. to early Oct. \n \nRoute: Travel County Road 1 north out of Pillager and turn east on 72nd Street, a gravel road. Make a loop by turning south on 25th Avenue SW. and west on County Road 29. \n \nWhy: A profusion of fall color lines this bucolic route, but the stretch on 72nd Street offers the peak peek. “Last year, that first mile on 72nd was the most fall color I have seen anywhere,” Frieler said. County Road 1 winds past lakes and through a speck of town called, fittingly enough, Maple. Turn onto the gravel of 72nd, and you get a “sweet lane with hobby farms and some abandoned farm buildings and grazing cattle.” Maples paint the sky red here if you hit the right weekend. “It’s pretty colorful.” \n \nThe inn: The Oliver Acreage, in a rural area near Nisswa and Pequot Lakes, has two main buildings, both newly constructed for the purpose of a bed-and-breakfast. The farmhouse has three bedrooms, all on the second floor and with their own bathrooms. Hearty country breakfasts are served to farmhouse guests. The barn lodge, designed as a group space, sleeps up to 10 guests in three bedrooms. It has a large kitchen and an event area, free to those who are renting the barn lodge (think book clubs and scrapbooking groups). Rooms start at $79 a night (7396 45th Av. SW., Pequot Lakes, Minn.; 1-218-568-8560; theoliveracreage.com). \n \nDrive #4: New Ulm \n \nInnkeeper: Shannon McKeeth of Bingham Hall. \n \nRoute: Head out of New Ulm traveling north on Hwy. 15 and just after the bridge over the Minnesota River, take a left on County Road 21, which follows the Minnesota River all the way to Fort Ridgely State Park. Loop back to New Ulm through Sleepy Eye by taking Hwy. 4 south to Hwy. 14, or just turn around and take what Mc­Keeth calls “the river road” back. \n \nShoot for: Late Sept. to mid Oct. \n \nWhy: Drive this curvy, lazy two-lane, past the hills and valleys of the Minnesota River Valley, and you’ll wonder if a horse-and-buggy will come clomping around the next bend. It feels lost in time. A stop along the road — the 1870s Harkin Store with silk shoes, farm implements and lanterns on display — adds to that effect. The drive leads to another historic site: Fort Ridgely State Park, a training ground for Civil War soldiers that was attacked by the Dakota in 1862. “There is even a weathered old Kent cigarette sign along the road,” McKeeth said. “The road is very cozy, very quaint.” \n \nThe inn: Bingham Hall, on a ridge overlooking the valley, has four rooms, each with its own bathroom and pillow-top-like beds. Rates from $119 (500 S. German, New Ulm, Minn.; 1-507-354-6766; bingham-hall.com).  \n \nDrive #5: Preston \n \nInnkeeper: Marc Sather of Jailhouse Inn. \n \nRoute: Take the 88-mile Historic Bluff Country Hwy. 16 Scenic Byway, which passes through Lanesboro, Preston and other sweet towns. \n \nShoot for: Late Sept. to mid Oct. \n \nWhy: “Drive west from La Crescent and you pass through an area that was untouched by glacial Lake Agassiz,” Sather said. “There are deep valleys and beautiful vistas.” Tall bluffs, limestone outcroppings and hardwood forests make this one of the most iconic routes in Minnesota. It is pretty in any season, but outstanding in fall, when autumn hues bring new dimensions to the bluffs and farmscapes. Before Interstate 90 cut through the state, this was the route west to the Black Hills. The road parallels the Root River and passes Peterson State Fish Hatchery, which spawns more than 100,000 trout annually and is open for self-guided tours. For sustenance and more gorgeous views, stop at Four Daughters Vineyard in Spring Valley, where tapas are served along with top-notch pours. \n \nThe inn: True to its name, the Jailhouse Inn began life as the Fillmore County jail, and also housed the courthouse and the sheriff’s home and office until 1970. Now you can stay in rooms offering luxuries that belie their past, with names such as the Detention Room and the Drunk Tank. Rates begin at $85 a night (109 Houston St. NW., Preston, Minn.; 1-507-765-2181; jailhouseinn.com). \n \n 
0607_9836c5ab-84b0-4d67-ada0-3026fd9d2f1d	Elder Richard G. Scott was known by many as a gentle giant.\nHis soft-spoken voice drew people to listen to his words, as he would teach and expound the gospel.\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints saw him as a special witness of the Savior, and Scott took the responsibility on with all his heart, might, mind and strength, until his body and mind had given their all.\nSo it may come as a surprise to some that this soft-spoken apostle also had a great sense of humor, loved to crank up the sound on his stereo, and played the clarinet.\nDuring a Wednesday interview with the Daily Herald, his son Michael W. Scott remembered some of the sweet at-home moments with his dad.\n“He has a great sense of humor,” Scott said. “Most people would not see that, but get him rolling (telling jokes) and he’d keep going and going and going.”\nMichael Scott remembers a while back when he was traveling with his father, who was on an assignment as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to Oaxaca, Mexico. He was meeting with 150 missionaries.\nThe elders and sisters had already assembled and were sitting reverently with straight faces waiting for Elder Scott to enter the room. Observing the rather uptight demeanor of the congregation from the doorway, Elder Scott and his son entered the room and took their place on the stand.\nBefore sitting down, Elder Scott looked at those assembled and said, “You all look so solemn. I want to tell you a joke.”\nAccording to Michael Scott, the apostle told a couple of jokes to get the missionaries laughing and then told them to keep those smiles on their faces. Then he sat down. The meeting started and progressed as planned.\n“The missionaries were shocked,” Michael Scott said.\nHe noted most of the missionaries had never been exposed to an apostle’s sense of humor.\nThere wasn’t anything that made Elder Scott smile more than his beloved wife Jeanene. Those who have heard any of his general conference talks or read any of his writings know she is always mentioned. She remained a part of all he did, even after her death at age 65 from cancer.\nRichard and Jeanene Scott met and fell in love in Washington, D.C., where their parents were working. His father was an assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture, Ezra Taft Benson, and she was the daughter of U.S. Sen. Arthur V. Watkins.\nMichael Scott recalls that as a daughter of a U.S. senator, his mother was involved with several social activities. After the Scott's marriage they attended a ball where many people recognized and spoke with Jeanene, and referred to Richard as Jeanene’s husband.\n“After that, my father told her, ‘Someday you’re going to be known as Richard Scott’s wife,'” Michael Scott said.\nEven after her death, Michael Scott said his father referred to his mother in the present tense. Elder Scott was often asked if he planned on remarrying. He would respond he was already married.\nThe Scotts fell in love in college, but were prompted to serve LDS missions at the same time. They were married within weeks after both had returned home.\n“They had a really unique and deep love,” Michael Scott said. “My mother told me once that she loved my dad so much that she decided if anything happened to him on his mission she would not marry, but wait.”\nThey both believed marriage was eternal and fully expected to be together forever.\nOne of Elder Scott’s other loves was music, and really cool stereo systems, according to Michael Scott. Elder Scott was known for having the best sound system on the block.\n“My dad loved jazz music. He helped pay for college by playing (the clarinet) in a jazz band,” Michael Scott said. “He loved stereo systems and always had to have the largest speakers.”\nWhen Elder Scott had a particularly rough day, he would come home and, while still in his suit and tie, lay on the floor, crank up the jazz and lay there and relax. Michael Scott said his father liked old-style jazz, particularly Benny Goodman and his contemporaries.\nFrom listening to cranked-up woofers and tweeters, to top-secret work on nuclear reactors, Richard G. Scott’s life was full of discovery, research and learning.\nElder Scott was a man of science, distinguishing himself in the field of nuclear physics. He reported directly to Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the father of the nuclear Navy.\nIt’s not just that Elder Scott was assigned to complete designs on the core of a nuclear reactor, but most of the now-accepted science on such a thing didn’t even exist.\n“Dad authored chapters and books, pushing the frontier on nuclear power,” Michael Scott said. “He was brilliant, and when he does something he goes all in.\n"His mindset was engineering, and his mind was always asking questions if there was a better way.” That is why for Elder Scott, church and science worked beautifully together, according to Michael Scott. He was always asking if it could be done better.\n“His service in the church exemplified that,” Michael Scott said. “Try something different, he would say.”\nMany times Elder Scott would bring something home, and he and Michael would do some investigating.\n“Let’s take this apart and see how it works, how it does what it does,” Michael Scott said, referring to his father's excitement to learn.\nAs much as his father loved to learn and do research, even getting the equivalent of a Ph.D from a top-secret program, he was always concerned about the individual.\n“I heard someone use the term that my father was the ‘apostle of the one,'” Michael Scott said. “He was always pursuing seeking out the one, the sinner, the abused, the ones on the fringes.\n"He’d reach out and had the ability to connect with those he was speaking to. It was a unique gift.”\nFuneral services for Elder Scott will be held at 11 a.m. Monday in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. The funeral will be open to the public ages 8 and older.\nThe Temple Square gates and the Tabernacle doors will open at 9:30 a.m. Those wishing to attend should be in their seats by 10:30 a.m. Overflow seating will be available in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square.\nThe funeral services will be broadcast live via MormonNewsroom.org, LDS.org, KSL TV 5.2, BYUtv, BYUtv Global, BYUtv Eleven, BYUtv International, Mormon Channel, Canal Mormón (Spanish) and on the LDS Church satellite system. In addition, audio broadcasts will air on KSL radio, BYU Classical 89 and BYU Radio.\nA private burial service will take place at Wasatch Lawn Memorial Park in Salt Lake City following the funeral.\nThere will be no public viewing, but expressions of sympathy can be posted on Elder Scott’s official Facebook page or emailed to condolences@ldschurch.org.\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the church’s General Missionary Fund at give.lds.org/elderscott.

The Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk went to jail Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, but five of her deputies agreed to comply with the law, ending a two-month standoff. (Image source: Carter County Detention Center via AP) \n \nAttorneys for Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis officially appealed the ruling on Sunday. The three-page motion does not include arguments as to why Davis should be released but amends Davis’ earlier appeal of the judge’s order. \n \nDavis objects to same-sex marriage for religious reasons and stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Two gay couples sued her. U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to issue the licenses but she refused to do it saying she could not betray her conscience. \n \nBunning sent Davis to jail on Thursday for disobeying his order. Her deputy clerks then issued marriage licenses to gay couples Friday. \n \n— \n \nFollow Dave Urbanski ( @DaveVUrbanski ) on Twitter \n \nRead more stories from TheBlaze \n\n\n‘Kim Davis for President’: Hundreds Rally to Support Jailed Clerk Who Won’t Issue Marriage Licenses to Gay Couples \n\nMichelle Obama’s Birthday Tweet to Beyonce Includes Extra Message That Rubs a Few Folks the Wrong Way \n\n‘Women’s Alternative Chorus’ Sings Gospel Tune at Hillary Clinton Campaign Event — and Changes One Very Important Lyric \n\nKey Democrat Comes Out Against Iran Deal Which He Says ‘Legitimizes Iran’s Nuclear Program’ \n\nNew Election Poll Measures Trump Against Hillary, Head to Head.

0609_0f113a6f-5ad0-4af7-80af-5e3b646ea0ea	Carrie Derick of the Montreal Suffrage Association, who managed to stay out of trouble during the Conscription Crisis, by making ambiguous statements in the Press, rather than ambivalent ones.\nIn June, 1917 the Press was reporting that Prime Minister Borden was likely going to give Canadian women the vote for the next election.\nBy September, 1917, it was clear only women with men at the front, brothers, sons, husbands, would get to vote.\nWhat happened in between?\nWell, that narrative will provide the climax of the book I am working on, Service and Disservice, a follow up to Furies Cross the Mersey.\nFuries Cross the Mersey covers the Canadian Suffragists from 1910 to 1913 and Service and Disservice will cover the WWI years.\nMrs. Pankhurst and her troops figure in both books, in spirit and, occasionally, in body.\nAccording to Pierre Berton, in his book Marching As to War, what happened was that Arthur Meighen, Borden's Right Hand Man, met Nelly McClung out West and she warned him that many women living out there would not support Conscription. Berton claims McLung was the one who floated the idea of limited franchise.\nOf course, she could have suggested not letting NEW Canadian women vote out West, but then Quebec women would get the vote and that was no good either, in the minds of Win-the-War types.\nAnd they weren't shy about saying it, either.\nSo, on Augusts 2, 1917, at the Win-the-War meetings in Toronto, Borden (or Meighen) took a few Women's leaders aside (leaders of the WCTU, IODE, The National Council of Women and the National Equal Franchise League run by Constance Hamilton) and asked them to poll their Canada-wide membership to see if women would support his Union Government and, by extension, his Conscription Bill if they were allowed to vote.\nThe Leaders did just that and the answer came back an resounding NO.\nI recently read a hairy account of these very Win-the-War meetings in Toronto in the Women's Century, the organ of the National Council of Women.\nIt seems the women of Canada were only given 48 hours notice that they were invited, which means that this was a last minute decision on the part of the Borden Government.\nA few speakers were invited especially to 'educate' the women: One women who had three sons at the Front was blunt about why Conscription was necessary: to increase the odds of her own sons surviving.\nNot a very noble reason, if you think about it. More of a selfish one.\n"If we don’t send men to the front, we can’t get back our boys who are there. Those men who have kept our home and our liberty for us." A "great war veteran" said: “What we want is a union, a common platform of sacrifice and duty to be distributed all over the country." So, these Society women got all caught up in the emotion of it all and then, later on, the suffragists among them got caught up in their own ambivalence/hypocrisy.\nThe suffrage leaders had to backtrack, claiming publically that they OPPOSED limited franchise on principle, because many among their membership did.\nThe minutes of the Montreal Council of Women show that they supported WWI from the start. The yearbooks says, "most women were away in the country when war broke out' but they soon got their act together and started a Khaki League, to provide soldiers with convalescent care, clean laundry and 'wholesome' entertainment. Miss Derick was appointed President.\n(Most Suffrage leaders had long expressed their support of Conscription, but in Montreal, the Local Council was forced to say in the Press that it never supported Conscription, not technically. It supported Mandatory National Service for both men and women. (Their minutes show otherwise.) LOL. Still, President Grace Ritchie England stumped for Wilfrid Laurier in the 1917 election and suffered an impeachment hearing for it.)\nMrs. Torrington, the President of the National Council of Women, also had an especially hard time of it. She too was chastised for speaking on behalf of the entire MCW membership on these touchy political issues when she hadn't been given the mandate. It was easy to see why she did, though.\nThe Woman's Century Magazine printed another article in September, 1917, revealing that an official resolution was passed by the National Council of Women protesting against Borden's Dominion Franchise Bill - and sent to his office.\nThen the article immediately goes on to explain why Limited Franchise is a very good thing. Did you know that many POW's caught by the Allies were Canadian Germans fighting for the enemy?  Did you know that 'foreign' women voted in greater proporation than British born women, in the provincial elections?\n"The greater is hidden in the lesser" with this Dominion Franchise the author of the article, suggesting  the Suffragists of Canada had found a way to trick Borden into giving women the vote, one parcel at a time.\n(Borden told some suffrage leaders that this Limited Franchise was a way to let fighting men vote, through their relations.)\nWhatever excuse worked.\nI have a letter Borden sent to the Fédération St. Jean Baptiste in Quebec, in answer a letter of protest. Borden says he has sent the very same letter to another angry group.\nThe PM sounds very frazzled in the letter. "Don't you realize how hard it is for me?" he writes. "Would you want a woman who had been in Canada just 3 months to be allowed to vote, because she married a British Subject?"\nIn the Press he was claing that "the Women of Canada support my Dominion Franchise Bill."\nHe wasn't exactly lying, was he?

0614_e7ca8a5b-ce1d-45a2-82f4-0e4e2bb487df	Terrence Howard , who is as well known for his history of abusing women as he is for playing Lucious Lyon on Empire , invited Rolling Stone  into his Chicago penthouse where he said some unbelievably batsh-- things. From his multiple excuses for punching women to the mathematical theory he invented that "proves" one times one actually equals two, every word out of Howard's mouth is so shockingly outrageous, it's hard to imagine Howard knowingly said all these things to a journalist. But that's just Terrence Howard, for you. He doesn't have the energy to waste worrying over what other people think - unless that thing is that one times one equals one. Check out the most insane things from Howard's profile below: 1. Howard is a man of 432 faces: While looking at himself in the mirror wearing silk loungewear and a scarf, Howard explained that in his head he's actually a young boy - but only for that moment. Apparently, Howard's identity is constantly in flux. "Today, for me, has been about searching out who I am," he said. "We've got all these different faces that want to come out -- there's at least four just in this moment, with a possible expansion to 432 -- but which one do you let out? Is it the person who's cool that you've mastered? Is it the excited little boy?" 2. Howard is a mathematical genius, according to Howard: As the actor explained, the entire world is doing math wrong and he is the only one to have figured out the true order of the universe. "This is the last century that our children will ever have been taught that one times one is one," Howard said. "They won't have to grow up in ignorance. Twenty years from now, they'll know that one times one equals two." When Howard first came up with this theory, he even came up with his own language, Terryology, and wrote forward and backwards so that no one could steal it before it could patent it. Once he married restaurateur Mira Pak in 2013, he made her help him with cutting shapes out of plastic for up to 17 hours each day. "And the proof is in these pieces," Howard explained. "I have created the pieces that make up the motion of the universe. We work on them about 17 hours a day. She cuts and puts on the crystals. I do the main work of soldering them together. They tell the truth from within." VIDEO: Let Cookie read you to fifth in his Empire supercut Page 2 of 4 - 3. Howard says he isn't "difficult" for refusing to take direction: The actor has a notorious reputation for being difficult, which started on the set of 1999's The Best Man . But Howard says what they called being "difficult" was actually just ingenious acting. "I was difficult, but only because I would not conform," Howard explained. "During The Best Man , they kept saying about this one line, 'This is a joke, so say it as a joke.' I was like, 'Y'all do what you want, but I'm not going to mutilate this moment.' And I said the line like I wanted, pausing before saying, 'Y'all know there ain't nothin' better than p----, except some new p----.' That seals my character, who he was. But after that, they spent the next year talking about how difficult I was." 4. Howard is never at fault for hitting women: For every time someone has accused him of assault, Howard either has an excuse or outright denies it. When police reported he punched his first wife Lori McCommas "with a closed first," Howard explained he only "slapped her in front of the kids." When his second wife Michelle Ghent was spotted with a black eye after a 2013 trip to Costa Rica , Howard claimed she was trying to Mace him "and you can't see anything so all you can do is try to bat somebody away, and I think that something caught her. But I wasn't trying to hit her." And when Howard hit a man and woman waiting in line to be seated at a restaurant, he was only "acting in self-defense." 5. Howard's life outlook was inspired by watching his dad stab someone with a nail file: In 1971, Howard was in line with his father Tyrone to see a department store Santa. When a man accused Tryone of cutting them in line, Tyrone stabbed the man until he fell and fled the scene. "My daddy taught me, 'Never take the vertebrae out of your back or the bass out of your throat. I ain't raisin' sheep. I raised men. Stay a man,'" Howard said. "But being a man comes with a curse because it's not a society made for men to flourish anymore. Everything is androgynous, you know? The more successful men now are the effeminate." Terrence Howard was "coerced" into divorce settlement 6. Howard's controlling attitude gave his third wife agoraphobia: Throughout the interview, Howard and his third wife Pak pretended to be happily married and living together. It was only later that it was revealed the couple had separated and filed for divorce months prior to the interview - and it's clear why the couple didn't make it. Page 3 of 4 - Despite acknowledging that she has "an amazing connection" with Howard, Pak didn't hold back about how hard their relationship was on her. "Isn't that crazy? But, I mean, he's not perfect. Doesn't do the dishes. Doesn't cook. Doesn't lift a finger. I probably leave him 30 times a month," Pak said. "He's so selfish. But, you know, he didn't have much of a childhood. It was difficult for him being picked on and bullied all the time. We don't have a normal life. In our two years together, I've only gone to restaurants with him two or three times. We've never been to the supermarket together. We've never been to the movies. I've never gotten a gift from him. Never, never. "And then every minute that he has free, it's to do this," Pak said, referencing the plastic shapes. "I help him, cutting, drawing and putting things together. I've developed a slight form of agoraphobia lately. I never go out. I have no friends here. I feel like Rapunzel, you know, stuck in a penthouse with my baby." 7. Howard said he took a $1 million pay cut to get Robert Downey Jr. an audition for Iron Man : Howard was the highest-paid actor in Iron Man , raking in $3.5 million for the film. But according to the actor, it was supposed to be $4.5 million, until Marvel refused to consider Robert Downey Jr. for the lead role. So Howard, the charitable man that he is, allegedly offered to take a $1 million pay cut if Marvel auditioned and hired Downey. "Robert was so thankful and dadadadada ," Howard said, whatever that means. But when Marvel said it was reducing Howard's part and salary for the sequel, Don Cheadle was hired to replace him. "And so," he said, "I called Robby and was like, 'Look, man‰.‰.‰.' Leaving messages with his assistants, called him at least 17 times that day and 21 the next and finally left a message saying, 'Look, man, I need the help that I gave you.' Never heard from him. And guess who got the millions I was supposed to get? He got the whole franchise, so I've actually given him $100 million, which ends up being a $100 million loss for me from me trying to look after somebody, but, you know, to this day I would do the same thing. It's just my nature." 8. Howard loves playing guests his blackmail CD: Though Howard said he doesn't "talk about my ex-wife because I don't talk about negative things," he later played the entire 13-minute recording of a phone call in which Ghent attempted to extort him. In the call, Ghent threatens to sell the tabloids tapes of him having phone sex and dancing naked if he doesn't pay her because "You're a f---ing sociopath. Everybody should know it. I'm so sick of the sh-- that you've put me through." Page 4 of 4 - Howard apparently played the tape to show that Ghent is the villain in their relationship, a stance that was seriously undermined when he, according to the writer, "[glared] at the laptop, leaning toward it, hissing, 'You f---ing bitch. Shut the f--- up! Shut the f--- up!'" Other Links From TVGuide.com
0615_a22106e2-f0c6-4827-8630-9f38368c3dea	Amazing victory at Lord's gave us a day to savour \n\nLast Saturday at Lord's has to go down as my proudest day in 10 years as a Gloucestershire cricketer, and I can't think of many better ones in my whole career.\n\nWinning any trophy at any level is special, but the manner in which we beat Surrey to lift the Royal London One-Day Cup was pretty amazing and still quite hard to believe.\n\nI still get quite emotional thinking about it now. The squad that we played with at Lord's and all the people there supporting us made it a fantastic occasion.\n\nIt was a tight game played in a great spirit and everything seemed to happen for us at the end, but the first person you have to credit is Geraint Jones.\n\nSo much attention was on him playing his last game of professional cricket, and his half-century was crucial in terms of giving us something to defend.\n\nWe weren't in an ideal situation with early wickets down and not too many runs on the board, but I thought Geraint showed true class and courage in some crucial partnerships with Gareth Roderick, Tom Smith and especially Jack Taylor.\n\nAfter that I thought our bowlers were magnificent. James Fuller's opening spell was a good as you get in one-day cricket, and along with David Payne he made sure Surrey never got away from us.\n\nThen our slower bowlers did what they've been doing all season, putting the squeeze on, and when the pressure really cranked up towards the end they showed what bottle they have.\n\nI sensed we might have a sniff when Kumar Sangakkara and Rory Burns got out, purely because I knew there were some young guys due to come in after Azhar Mahmood. It's a big ask for a 17-year-old like Sam Curran to get his team across the line in that situation.\n\nIn fact he batted brilliantly, and I think he is a top-class player in the making, but we held our nerve and it was hard to explain the feeling when we took those last three wickets.\n\nBefore the game my wife said she wasn't sure whether to bring our kids – it was very long day for them – but I'm so glad they had the chance to come onto the field with me and didn't miss out on the celebrations.\n\nI've never experienced an atmosphere like it. Our fans never stopped singing, even when the game seemed to be going against us, and I don't think the Surrey people had an answer.\n\nThe Glorious Glosters victory song is one we hold dear, and singing it in front of our unbelievable fans was so fitting because I don't think any of them left the ground for about an hour after the game finished.\n\nThis trophy is for them and it's a reward for a lot of hard work over the last five years, both under John Bracewell and now the new coaching regime of Richard Dawson and Ian Harvey.\n\nMichael Klinger obviously had an amazing tournament, but we won it thanks to having a balanced side and everyone contributing when we were under the pump.\n\nIt's not easy getting to finals and winning titles, and I can think of a few 50-over games this summer that could have gone either way, but hopefully we can use it as a springboard for more success.\n\nAt 36 I'm not too sure how many more chances I'll get to win tournaments, but there are a lot of young guys in our changing room who have had the taste for it now and I'm sure they want more.\n\nHaving said that, we'll have to start all over again next year and there are a lot good teams out there, so we'll savour the moment for now.\n\nMy little boy still keeps wanting to watch highlights of the second innings, and even now it all feels a bit surreal.\n\nThe noise and the reaction at the end of the game still gives me goosebumps and I'm sure it will be like that for a long time.\n\nBenny has been a revelation in all formats during a positive year for the County\n\nThis is my final column of the season and a good opportunity to reflect on how Gloucestershire have progressed as a team and a club.\n\nIt's definitely been a positive year overall, winning our first trophy for 11 years and seeing some of our younger guys – particularly the bowlers – take some big strides forward.\n\nLiam Norwell has taken 61 Championship wickets and is unlucky not to be in England's performance group alongside Craig Miles, while David Payne has also improved and Benny Howell has been a bit of a revelation in all formats.\n\nThe batting has been a bit more disappointing, although I'm pleased that Chris Dent has bounced back from a difficult year with three Championship hundreds.\n\nUnfortunately our collective batting hasn't been good enough, especially in the first innings of red-ball matches, and we need to make Bristol a fortress again next year.\n\nThe white-ball game is definitely an area we've improved on and we were disappointed to narrowly miss out on the quarter-finals of the NatWest T20 Blast.\n\nWe played some excellent cricket in that competition but couldn't quite nail enough of the tight games, which is something we obviously put right in the 50-over one.\n\nI do know all the guys will work extremely hard on their games during the off-season, myself included, and we are determined to push on in 2016.\n\nI'm planning to spend a month in South Africa with my family but otherwise I'll be here in the UK throughout the winter and back on the training programme.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who has supported us this season, which has been a special one for me with my benefit. See you all next summer!\n\nENDS

0619_c0106bfa-763b-4342-a93f-da1178f1bf6c	Our tenth and final stop of the cruise was the wonderful city of Copenhagen, Denmark. Fox chose to sit this one out again and stay and play with his new little friends on the boat so it was just Evans party of three. Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, is the gateway to Scandinavia and also its most affordable and fun-loving city. The city is huge, but it has a walkable core which has most of the big sights. We hopped on a local city bus from the cruise port and rode to one of the biggest tourist attractions in Copenhagen: The Little Mermaid Statue.    This is one of the most visited and photographed symbols of Copenhagen. The statue was a gift to the city in 1909 from the wealthy Carl Jacobsen to honor one of the city's most famous resident's most famous stories.\nWe snapped a couple a pics and moved along admiring these awesome clouds.\nJust down from The Little Mermaid is Kastellet Park.\nThe park has some wonderful sights and was filled with people enjoying the wonderful summer weather.\nAt the head of the park is the large Gefion Fountain. From 1908, the fountain illustrates the myth of the goddess who was given a single night to carve out a hunk of Sweden to make into Denmark's main island, Sjælland. The goddess Gefion transformed her four sons into oxen to do the job and with their help took a piece from Sweden and created this island.\nAlso nearby is an Anglican Church made of flint which gave it a very interesting exterior.\nFrom the park we headed further into the city center.\nJust a couple of blocks later we arrived in the center of Amalienborg Square surrounded by the Amalienborg Palace. In the center of the square stands the equestrian statue of Frederick V. He designed this area as part of what was to be a new town called Frederikstaden.\nThis palace is the royal residence of Queen Margrethe II and her husband, while her son, the heir to the throne, lives in the palace building just across the street.\nAnother of the palace buildings that ring the square.\nUp the street from the square is the striking Frederikskirke, often called the "Marble Church" because of its exterior covered in marble. It was a ritzy church designed to fit in this fancy new town.\nAlso nearby is another cool orthodox church. Love these.\nAs we continued our walk we saw the ultra modern Opera House. It's actually even bigger than it looks because much of it is underground. Its striking design is controversial and not all city residents are in love with it. At least they can't complain about the cost: the building was a $400 million gift to the nation from a wealthy oil-shipping magnate, Henning Larsen.\nThen we reached my absolute favorite part of Copenhagen: Nyhavn. Established in the 1670s, Nyhavn ("New Harbor") is a recently gentrified sailors' quarter. It has trendy cafes, jazz clubs, and tattoo shops, and it is a wonderful place to hang out and just admire the beauty of the multi-colored buildings.\nThe canal is filled with glamorous old sailboats. Historic sloops are welcome to moor here in Copenhagen's ever-changing boat museum.\nChris and Paige on Friday August 8th 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Jane was in the stroller and Fox was on the boat.\nWow! It took my breath away.\nAfter lingering in the sun and just enjoying the vibe of Nyhavn, we continued into the city and passed by the National Theater.\nSuper pretty.\nCool Copenhagen.\nWe were starting to get a little snacky so we decided to try some of the famous Danish Pølse, a local hot dog. The lady working the cart was excited for us to try all the various toppings so she gave us a dish full of the condiments for us to try. They were very tasty.\nFrom here it was pretty much a straight shot down the Strøget, a long, charming pedestrian drag in the heart of the city.\nThe "stork" fountain (which are actually herons) stands in a square along the street.\nThen we found one of our must-stop sights: Copenhagen's flagship lego store.\nYep, we were in heaven. Pick a color, any color! We bought a few little things including a super cool lego minifigure Copenhagen magnet.\nAfter getting our lego fix we continued on, somehow missing the church that has the original Christ is Risen statue, a very famous statue in our religion, and made it to the Rådhus, the city hall. Checking out the Rådhuspladsen.\nJust to the right of the city hall is a statue of famous resident, Hans Christian Andersen, known for such classic fairy tales as The Ugly Duckling, The Little Mermaid, and The Emperor's New Clothes. Oh, and of course, The Snow Queen which Frozen was based on.\nThen we made it to one of the highlights of Copenhagen: Tivoli Gardens! In 1843, magazine publisher Georg Carstensen convinced the king to let him build a "pleasure garden" outside the walls of crowded Copenhagen. The king quickly agreed and Tivoli became Europe's first great public amusement park.\nThe park is 20 acres and has 110,000 lights and lanterns. You pay a low admission price for the ticket and then pay for the rides as well.\nSuch a cool, old-world park.\nThere are fountains and parks, free concerts, pantomime theaters, ballets, acrobats, puppets and other things all over the park.\nBeautiful. We learned that the way to do it is to buy a mutli-ride wrist band. That is the only way to make this in any way economical. We, unfortunately, didn't learn that until after we had bought several single ride tickets. I think it ended up costing us $6 for Chris and Jane to just ride this one little kids ride.\nThen we let Jane ride the old-timey carousel.  The park has lots of different themes to the buildings, kind of like an Epcot Center mixed with the fun rides of a Magic Kingdom. This roller coaster goes screaming through the tranquil Asian market.\nLooks awesome. Next time.\nWe enjoyed the rest of our day in the ambiance of Tivoli Gardens and then made our way back to the boat. The next day was our last day and we had to disembark in the morning and make our way to the airport to fly home.\nAll the luggage from the cruise passengers awaiting pick up. Even the exit process on the boat was smooth and hassle free.\nBecause we had to leave the boat so early we had about 5 hours to kill at the airport. Thankfully there was a great play area. The kids ran and played for hours while Chris looked on and I napped :) Farvel Copenhagen!  And that concludes our epic, wonderful, incredible Scandinavian/Baltic/Russian Cruise!
0620_cda50515-95e5-4f58-8811-08e2eb0d306f	Hawaii has been the centre of plenty of movie action, and many of the places filmed can be visited by tourists. \n\nEven six decades later, it remains one of the sexiest scenes Hollywood has ever produced. Two illicit lovers – the neglected wife of an American officer and his First Sergeant – flaunt their affair, lying in each other's arms as the Hawaiian surf washes suggestively over them, oblivious to the fact that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is only weeks away.\n\nYes, it's the famous "beach scene" at Halona​ Cove, Oahu​ in From Here to Eternity. Fred Zinnemann's 1953 film (starring Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra) won 13 Oscars and remains the most celebrated movie ever made in the 50th State.\n\nAnd, yes, of course you can join the countless couples who have lain in the surf at Halona Cove replicating the scene. Hawaii – "Hollywood's favourite backlot" – has been the location of at least 100 movies since Eternity as well as countless television shows: most notably Lost, Magnum P.I. and Hawaii Five-O.\n\nIf you can't recognise that many, it is often because most of the films shot in Hawaii aren't set in Hawaii.\n\nApart from the state's consistently good weather, its pool of technical talent, and its tax breaks, Hawaii's main attraction to filmmakers is that its geography and topography can double for, well, just about anywhere hot and exotic. Which is why films as diverse as South Pacific, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Tropic Thunder, Waterworld, and George of the Jungle have all used Hawaiian locations.\n\nBut let's concentrate on movies set in Hawaii, featuring real places tourists can visit. Although Bing Crosby's 1938 film Waikiki Wedding was the first major box office success set in Hawaii itself, Elvis Presley did more to promote Hawaii as a dream destination than anyone.\n\nWe forget Hawaii was never a mass tourism destination before 1959 when it became the 50th State. The late 1950s and early '60s also coincided with cheaper air travel with commercial jets slicing flight times from the west coast of the United States.\n\nElvis made three movies in Oahu in the early 1960s. Blue Hawaii (the first and best) was released in 1961, followed by Girls, Girls, Girls in 1962 and Paradise Hawaiian Style in 1965. All three were Technicolour spectaculars in which the tropical scenery, beach lifestyle and potential for romance were at least as important as the plots.\n\nHead to Hanauma​ Bay, 18 kilometres east of Waikiki, to see where many of the most striking scenes in Blue Hawaii were filmed, though the beach shack where Elvis and his love interest, Joan Blackman, changed into their swimsuits is long gone.\n\nHanauma also featured in his other two Hawaiian movies, and is now a national park noted for being the best snorkelling spot on Oahu.\n\nGidget Goes Hawaiian, released in the same year as Blue Hawaii, was filmed at Waikiki's Royal Hawaiian Hotel. However the 1987 cult classic North Shore – filmed on Oahu's northern shore between Kaiaka Bay and Wailea Beach – is regarded by locals as the surf movie to watch (it involves Australia's own Mark Occhilupo​ in action).\n\nUnsurprisingly, most of the major box office successes set in Hawaii over the past two decades have been "rom-coms". Even 2001's Pearl Harbour, starring Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale​, is essentially a love story. My advice if you plan to see Pearl Harbour is to book an organised "boutique" tour that gives you access to USS Missouri – the ship that witnessed the surrender of the Japanese to end World War II.\n\nAdam Sandler​ and Drew Barrymore made a commercial success out of their second celluloid collaboration, 50 First Dates in 2004, mainly filmed in Oahu. Sandler's character worked at Sea Life Park, which you can visit.\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall (2008, starring Jason Segel​, Kristen Bell and Russell Brand) was filmed mainly at Turtle Bay Resort at the most northern point of Oahu, so just book a room at the resort.\n\nEasily the most critically acclaimed movie set in Hawaii recently has been The Descendants (2011) which won George Clooney a Golden Globe award for Best Actor. Clooney played a Honolulu lawyer who is the sole trustee of a family trust which owns 10,000 hectares of unspoilt land on the island of Kauai.\n\nMost of the movie was shot in Honolulu and Hanalei​ Bay, the largest bay on Kauai and a favourite spot for yachts in summer. Both the real life Tahiti Nui restaurant and bar in Hanalei have subsequently become popular haunts for movie fans.\n\nHowever the scene where the Clooney character drives up to a ridge to look over the land that is the subject of the family dispute is out of bounds: it was filmed at Kipu Ranch, a private cattle property on Kauai's southern shore.\n\nCameron Crowe's 2015 film Aloha, starring Brad Cooper, caused controversy in Hawaii because no native Hawaiian actors were cast in the film. Downtown Honolulu appears in the movie, but the most spectacular scenes involve Oahu's Ka'a'awa​ Valley.\n\nThis is the one spot you should visit if you want to see how one Hawaiian location can appear in so many different movies.\n\nOn the east coast of Oahu, near Kahana Bay, Ka'a'awa Valley appears in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Godzilla, 50 First Dates, George of the Jungle and Pearl Harbour.\n\nThe valley is part of a 1600-hectare cattle property, Kualoa Ranch. Even if you're not interested in movies, it is worth a visit. The options for tourists include horse riding, a shooting range, hula lessons and all-terrain vehicle tours.\n\nSounds like the plot for an Elvis movie? Cue the song.\n\nTRIP NOTES \n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\ngohawaii.com.au\n\nGETTING THERE\n\nHawaiian Airlines flies daily from Sydney and four times weekly from Brisbane direct to Honolulu, using new Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Connections from Melbourne and other Australian cities available with preferred partner Virgin Australia.\n\nHawaiian Airlines also has around 160 daily Boeing 717 flights between Honolulu and Kauai, Maui and both Kona and Hilo on Hawaii Island (The Big Island).\n\nSee hawaiianairlines.com.au.\n\nSteve Meacham travelled at his own expense.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0621_835bd9dc-9e39-482f-bb27-75816c8b4469	As a Constitutional Libertarian, I am looking for a candidate who understands the virtue and framework of the old Constitutional Republic which had protected our rights and liberties for many years. I am looking for a candidate who understands that our economy is best left in the hands of the American People, not in the hands of wealthy industrial tycoons and the politicians they purchase. I am looking for a candidate that understands the danger government poses, merely by virtue of its monopoly on force, to a free society. I am looking for a candidate who will fight for the liberty and sovereignty of the individual citizen and who will respect Federalism by respecting States’ Rights. \n \nFor all these reasons, Donald Trump could never represent me in elected office. I’m out, but what about the rest of my fellow libertarians? Well, his aggressive stance on military action overseas, with no structure or framework defining when and how such force would be warranted, or whether or not he would seek Congressional Approval, pretty much lost him half of all Libertarians. His support of tariffs lost him the other half. No one identifying with Libertarianism is going to vote for Donald Trump. He looks and sounds too much like a tyrant for us to support, or even vote for in a close election. \n \nConstitutionalists seem similarly weary and tentative. Donald Trump doesn’t seem like the kind of man that would allow something as decrepit and complicated as the United States Constitution stop him. He seems more like the kind of man who looks at what Obama has done, and figures he could use all the same executive powers, but unlike Obama, you know… do good. This kind of presence and attitude will scare the living hell out of constitutionalists, that is, people who care more about preserving the Constitutional Republic than winning partisan political victories. \n \nLucky for Trump, Constitutionalists and Libertarians probably constitute less than 5% of the American population. \n \nConservatives ranging from evangelicals to TEA Party types, Independents, and those old blue-dog Democrats seem to love the guy. In fact, everyone except establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats seem to love the guy. Donald Trump is polling well with minorities coveted by the GOP, despite his political incorrectness. Conservatives, long spat upon and humbled by the GOP Leadership cannot get enough of Trump’s belittling and humbling of that same Leadership. The enemy of their enemy is their friend, their candidate, and, if they have their way, the next President of the United States of America. \n \nThe American People are tired of having a weak, skulking, smarmy, elitist government. Trump is a strong, bold, plain-talking, billionaire of the people (yeah, I don’t get that either, but roll with it). The GOP Leadership are finally discovering how few Republicans actually stand with them and how many Republican voters straight up despise them. Their well-financed minority is losing their grip on their own electorate and I don’t think they’ll ever get it back. Sadly, I think the Rand Paul’s, Ted Cruz’s, and Mike Lee’s are going to fall victim to the kind of power-populism the American People are playing with, risking the further erosion of our Constitution, liberty, and rights. \n \nThe People are confusing Donald Trump with Ronald Reagan. Donald Trump more accurately resembles America’s first Progressive President, Theodore Roosevelt or his intellectual decedent Herbert Hoover. Thus, the Coolidge, Goldwater, Reagan Republicans are going to find themselves, even in the defeat of the GOP elite, still without a party of their own . \n \nThat is, unless we pause and give Ted Cruz and Rand Paul a second look. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n Article written by: Steven Brodie Tucker
0622_4403405b-61f4-4c50-afc5-94c8cfe71a70	 \nA soprano, beloved by tens of millions of Chinese, she is known as "Mama Peng" by disadvantaged children. Elegant and glamorous in the eyes of foreign statesmen and diplomats, this is China's first lady, Peng Liyuan. \n\nWhen Peng accompanies President Xi Jinping on his first state visit to the United States she will be in the public eye, participating in cultural activities, Xi's debut at the UN headquarters and other events. What image will she present to the US people? \n\nCameras flashed as the plane carrying China's first couple landed at Vnukovo-2 airport in Moscow on March 22, 2013. Xi and Peng walked down the stairs arm in arm as they emerged from the plane. As a renowned singer, Peng is used to the spotlight. As the first lady of China, she is stepping onto her biggest stage yet. \n\nShe's played the role successfully so far, capturing the public's attention as she visited more than 20 countries since her husband began his presidency. \n\nBut appearance is only a minor aspect of her charm, with her warm and friendly manner leaving a lasting impression. \n\nPeng was seen joining classes and bringing gifts for sick children as she visited schools and hospitals in Moscow, San Jose, Mexico City and other places, \n\n"I came to see you on behalf of tens of thousands of Chinese mothers. Children are the future of humanity. I hope you grow up in good health and happiness, and become useful members of society," she told a group of children at a boarding school in Moscow. \n\nThe first couple's love also endears their image. People are quick to notice they often wear matching scarves and ties, seen by observers as a public display of affection. The music video "Xi Dada loves Peng Mama", created by previously unknown artists, shot to 20 million clicks after being posted online for just five days. \n\nThough sometimes subtle, first lady diplomacy plays an important role in state visits, said Feng Yujun, a research fellow with the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. \n\n"First ladies often attend schools and hospitals, which helps make state visits more about the people and adds color to the traditional political and economic agenda," he said. \n\nIn a 2013 article entitled "Peng Liyuan: China's new business card," Singapore's Zaobao Newspaper spoke for many -- "Obviously, she is well positioned to be the first lady of China in the new era." \n\n"China needs a symbol to represent its image in non-traditional areas. It is not the Shenzhou spacecraft, an aircraft carrier, nor economic growth numbers, but beauty that can embody China's overall strength and deeply root among the people." \n\nEnvoy for cultural communication \n\nBut it's not just abroad that Peng has made an impact. \n\nShe regularly invites foreign guests to the Beijing opera, takes them on tours of historical places of interest and encourages them to participate in China's culture. \n\nShe worked with individual Indian kids teaching them calligraphy, showed Australian students how to make Chinese paper-cuts, and gave them panda toys as a gift. She encouraged them to learn Chinese and go to China one day to see a real panda. \n\nWhen US first lady Michelle Obama visited Beijing last year, she joined Peng for a calligraphy class at the Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University. \n\nOffering her help during the class, Peng delicately wrote the characters "hou de zai wu", or "social commitment", the day's assignment for students, and presented it as a gift to Michelle Obama. In that unforgettable China visit, the two also toured the famous Forbidden City. \n\n"Cultural and educational exchanges are very important to strengthen the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and US People and promote the development of bilateral relations," Peng told Michelle Obama. \n\nRise to soft power \n\nBorn to…
0623_0c48052e-a9e0-43ee-a2d4-224e07bb4196	Vice President Joe Biden told a crowd at an Atlanta synagogue last week he was still evaluating his family's emotional readiness for a third presidential run -- and that "there's no way to put a timetable on that." \n \nBut ready or not, key dates loom for Biden if he hopes to wrest support from current Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and have a chance at securing his party's nomination. \n\nOriginally, Biden said he would announce his intentions by the end of the summer: months later than other Democrats running for president, but well ahead of the campaign trail mileposts that will begin appearing this fall. \n\nHis associates now say the end-of-summer deadline is likely to slip by without an announcement as the vice president continues to wrestle with the late-May death of his eldest son, Beau. \n\nThe official end of summer -- Sept. 23 -- also falls on a busy week for the White House, with visits from Pope Francis and Chinese President Xi Jinping both on the schedule. As a key foreign policy hand, and the highest-ranking Catholic in the U.S. government, Biden is expected to play a role in both events -- and is unlikely to overshadow them with a campaign decision. \n\nInstead, a decision by Oct. 1 is more likely, according to people familiar with the vice president's decision-making. But even that date could slide as the vice president and his family continue to assess their "emotional energy" for what would undoubtedly be a grueling campaign. \n\nThe unpredictable nature of this year's race -- illustrated by the surge in support for outside candidates like Sanders and Donald Trump -- has led some Biden advisers to believe a late entry wouldn't be as detrimental as conventional wisdom might suggest. \n\n"As time goes on there appears to be a bigger and bigger space in the Democratic primary for him to step into," said one Biden adviser, speaking anonymously to describe the thinking within Biden's circle. \n\nThe first Democratic primary debate, a CNN-sponsored forum in Nevada, falls on Oct. 13 -- an important venue for Biden to introduce himself as a presidential contender to a national audience. \n\nBut while considered unlikely, even that could slip by without a decision from the vice president. The Democratic Party has committed to three other debates before the first ballots are even cast in the nominating contest, leaving Biden later opportunities to square off with rivals before voters must make a choice. \n\nOn Oct. 22, Clinton is set to testify before the Select Committee on Benghazi on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are expected to pepper the former secretary of state about her role in the 2012 attack in Libya, as well as her use of a private email while acting as the nation's top diplomat. \n\nWhile Biden's political advisers insist his decision will have little to do with Clinton's performance as a candidate -- and instead on his own capacity for a run -- a shaky performance during her testimony would only ramp up Democratic jitters about her candidacy. \n\nThere are hard-and-fast filing deadlines that Biden must abide by in order to appear on the ballot in key early voting states, though in some cases they have yet to be firmly established. In New Hampshire, the deadline to file for the first-in-the-nation primary typically falls toward the end of October, though the date this year hasn't been announced. \n\nIn South Carolina, where Biden's supporters say he has the best chance of slowing any momentum by Clinton or Sanders, Biden would need to file his candidacy by early December. \n\nAn analysis by the Brookings Institution found the number of potential delegates forfeited by waiting to declare until after December was substantial: if Biden missed filing deadlines through the end of December, he wouldn't be eligible for more than 1,500 potential delegates -- more than half of the 2,232 necessary to clinch the Democratic nomination. \n\nIn reality, Democratic operatives say Biden doesn't have until the filing deadlines to make a decision, noting the time required to build a campaign infrastructure and raise the millions needed to operate a feasible bid. \n\n"It's awfully late. You talk to people in Iowa, it seems early, but it's awfully late to begin the kind of organization it takes to win the Iowa caucuses," said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and a CNN senior political commentator. \n\n"Barack Obama was a dynamic candidate, but if we hadn't started organizing Iowa in March of 2007, he wouldn't have won the Iowa caucuses," Axelrod said. "Biden has no organization in Iowa today."
0624_f0373fe5-7fe6-4c7f-97ad-711eed7bfe1d	Walker Withdrawal Shows Changes in Republican Contest 26 Sep, 2015 by Michael Barone Print this article Font size -16+ Email Scott Walker’s abrupt withdrawal from the Republican presidential race Monday afternoon shows how different, in ways noticed and unnoticed, this campaign cycle is from those of recent years. One obvious difference is the size of the Republican field — 17, before Walker’s withdrawal and Rick Perry’s withdrawal 10 days before. That has made debates unwieldy and has placed a premium on somehow emerging from the scrum. Walker didn’t. He spoke for just seven minutes in the two-hour Fox News debate on Aug. 6 and the three-hour CNN debate (in which he was asked just three questions) on Sept. 16. It was not a format that favored Midwestern reticence. Walker’s withdrawal was unexpected also because, after the rise of billionaire-funded super PACs kept Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum plugging on in the 2012 cycle, it seemed a candidate with such backing had no reason to quit. But super PACs can’t pay for candidates’ staffs, offices and travel, and after the debates Walker couldn’t raise enough to pay for them. In previous cycles, it was assumed that voters were looking for candidates who could identify with ordinary people and the struggles they face, and Walker seemed typecast for that, saving up coupons to shop at Kohl’s. But today’s poll leader is a Manhattan billionaire who boats of (and perhaps inflates) his wealth and glories in his vulgarity. It has long been taken as a given that a successful candidate must concentrate on winning one of the early contests — the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire or South Carolina primary (no one has quite figured out how to target Nevada). Rudy Giuliani’s failure to settle on one state and demonstrate what he had in common with Republicans there led to his quick withdrawal in 2008. Walker’s obvious target was Iowa, next door to Wisconsin, demographically similar, where the candidate was born and spent his early years. His speech at the January Freedom Summit in Des Moines wowed the audience and rushed him to the top of polls in Iowa — and New Hampshire and nationally as well. That was a sign that, with the advent of new media, the contest had become nationalized. Walker nevertheless zeroed in on Iowa. He stressed his strong religious beliefs in a state whose caucus has had the largest concentration of evangelical Protestants of any contest outside the South. Having accepted blandly a court’s legalization of same-sex marriage in Wisconsin, he reacted to the Supreme Court’s similar decision by endorsing a constitutional amendment reversing it — a proposal that was going nowhere. He continued to stress his steadfastness in the face of furious opposition and threats of violence from public employee unions in Wisconsin, but he failed to do enough homework and settle on consistent responses to questions on national and foreign policy. The result was stories about his unwillingness to answer questions on a trip to London and directly contradictory statements on whether the Fourteenth Amendment confers birthright citizenship. He lost his lead in national polls by April, as other candidates got announcement-day bounces, and in New Hampshire polls by late May, two weeks before Trump’s announcement. In Iowa he was overtaken by Trump in the first week in August, before the first debate. Trump’s rise (and, more recently, the surges for Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina) has been ascribed to Republican voters’ desire for a candidate not besmirched by government and Washington. But I think what may be happening is that the Republican electorate is expanding to include many outside the familiar categories of economic, religious and libertarian conservatives. Walker, with his fight against public employee unions and frequent invocations of faith, with his small town upbringing and suburban political base, had the potential of appealing to the familiar groups. But not, it seems, to those seeking a champion from outside the political world. Certainly the Republican electorate has been open to expansion. In Iowa, Walker’s chosen target, only about 100,000 people have been attending Republican caucuses in a state of 3 million. Democrats, who run about even in statewide races there, have been attracting more than 200,000. The huge audiences for the Republican debates — 23 to 24 million, nearly triple previous highs — also suggest that many more Americans are interested in the party’s contest this cycle. While withdrawing, Walker urged others to coalesce around someone who could beat the (unnamed) poll leader. That hasn’t happened in other cycles. But this time seems different.

Recently, however, the stars have been opting for more traditional, often old-world names for their new additions. Here are some of our favorites. \n  A pregnant Keira Knightley and James Righton arrive to the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party. ADRIAN SANCHEZ-GONZALEZ/AFP/ (A pregnant Keira Knightley and James Righton arrive to the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party. ADRIAN SANCHEZ-GONZALEZ/AFP/)  \nChristopher Carlton Cumberbatch \n \nThough they’ve kept mum for the last three months, the name of Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter’s son has been deduced. The Sherlock star and his writer/director wife welcomed Christopher Carlton Cumberbatch on June 1. And while names don’t get much more traditional than Christopher, it’s the infant’s middle name that has the most meaning: Carlton is a family name shared by Cumberatch’s father and himself. \n \nJames and Leo Newman \n \nActress Jamie King’s sons (with husband, director Kyle Newman) both have distinguished names full of meaning. Of naming her boys James Knight and Leo Thames, she told People , “I want my child to feel strong in life and in business and what they do, but it’s still romantic at the same time. I like classic and eclectic mixed together, so it’s a bit of both of my worlds at the same time.” \n  \nEdie Righton \n \nAfter keeping her daughter’s name under wraps since her birth in May, Keira Knightly recently revealed the moniker in Elle . The baby girl, whose father is Knightly’s husband James Righton, is named Edie. While Knightly has yet to disclose the inspiration behind the name, Edie (often short for Edith) hit its peak of popularity in the 1960s (think Edie Sedgewick) and means prosperous in war. \n \nIsaiah Michael Fisher \n \nCarrie Underwood welcomed son Isaiah Michael Fisher in February. The middle name is a traditional tribute to Underwood’s hockey-playing hubby Mike Fisher, while the first name is a nod to the couple’s Christian faith. Isaiah is a Biblical name, meaning “salvation of the Lord.” \n  \nView the original at Parade or follow us on Twitter ,
0626_1f643a6b-1d85-4911-9f7a-812835475233	Reuters     \n\t\t\tPosted:  Monday, September 7, 2015, 11:28 PM    \n \nBy Larry Fine \n \nNEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Andy Murray fell out of the U.S. Open under a barrage of aces and service winners off the racquet of towering South African Kevin Anderson in a match that ended two grand slam streaks. \n \nAnderson reached his first grand-slam quarter-finals with a 7-6(5)6-3 6-7(2) 7-6(0) victory at Louis Armstrong Stadium after a string of seven losses in fourth round matches at grand slams. \n \nMurray's loss snapped the Briton's run of having reached 18 consecutive grand slam quarter-finals. \n   \n"That's obviously something that is disappointing to lose," said the third-seeded Scot, who smashed his racquet in frustration after losing the second set. "That's many years' work that's gone into building that sort of consistency. \n \n"Also to lose a match like that, that was over four hours, tough obviously after a couple of tough matches earlier in the tournament, as well. It's a hard one to lose, for sure." \n \nThe defeat came at Louis Armstrong Stadium, the U.S. National Tennis Center's second court. \n \n"That court is a lot quicker than Ashe. I felt like I was on the back foot quite a lot. Wasn't able to play that offensively," said Murray. \n \n"But when you're playing against someone that has the game style that he does, you're always going to have to do a fair bit of defending, especially if he serves well." \n \nMurray lamented some lost chances against the 6-foot-8 (2.03m) South African, seeded 15th. \n \n"When you're playing against players that are at that level, you need to make them think and then give them a chance to get nervous," he said about how the match might have gone differently had he cashed in a couple of break points. \n \n"I felt like I had my opportunities there but didn't manage to capitalize on them." \n \nMurray, who has struggled with a head cold in the past week and battled back to victory in the second round from two sets down, did not blame fatigue. \n \n"I was able to fight as I wanted to through to the end of the match. So I don't think the amount of tennis I played played a part. \n \n"It was more playing against Kevin on the court of that speed, and with him serving as well as he does, it's a tricky match. It comes down to a few points in each set. He managed to get them today."   (Editing by Greg Stutchbury)
0627_1fb16d9f-da87-4d71-a6dc-ede4427f2c78	GRAYSON, Ky. — County clerk Kim Davis was released from jail today, five days after a federal judge locked her up for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. \n \nU.S. District Judge David Bunning lifted the contempt order against Davis, saying he was satisfied that her deputies were fulfilling their obligation to grant licenses to same-sex couples in her absence. But he warned Davis not to interfere. \n \n“She’s a free woman,” Carter County jailer R.W. Boggs told Reuters. \n \nA crowd of dozens of sign-carrying, flag-waving supporters who had gathered on the jailhouse lawn for what they called a rally for religious freedom swelled to hundreds as the news of the judge’s action spread. Supporters handed out white crosses, sang “Amazing Grace” “God Bless America” and chanted, “Let Kim go!” \n \nThe move came down just before Davis received jailhouse visits from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz. They were ushered into the building shortly after the judge’s order was issued, as was Davis’ husband, Joe Davis. \n \nDavis was put in jail on Thursday for the boldest act of resistance by a public official yet to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that effectively legalized gay marriage across the nation. \n \nThe timing of her release order came as something of a surprise. Last week, Bunning said that he might reconsider his decision to jail her in a week. \n \nCiting “God’s authority,” Davis, an Apostolic Christian, stopped issuing marriage licenses in June after the Supreme Court said gay couples have a constitutional right to marry anywhere in the U.S. \n \nTwo gay couples and two heterosexual ones sued her. Bunning ordered Davis to issue the licenses, and the Supreme Court upheld his ruling. But she still refused, and was held in contempt of court and hauled off to jail in handcuffs, igniting protests from members of the religious right. \n \nThey have rallied for days outside her office, at the jail, even outside the judge’s home. \n \nFive of Davis’ six deputy clerks — all except her son, Nathan Davis — agreed to issue licenses to gay couples with Davis behind bars. In lifting the contempt order, Bunning asked for updates on the five clerks’ compliance every two weeks. \n \nDavis’ jailing has offered some of the many GOP presidential candidates an opportunity to appeal to the party’s evangelical Christian wing, which opposes gay marriage and casts Davis’ imprisonment as an issue of religious freedom. \n \nSome observers viewed the candidates’ visit to the jailhouse with skepticism, dismissing it as mere political posturing for two low-level candidates. \n \n“Politicians have latched onto the cause of the day for as long as there have been politicians,” said Sam Marcosson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Louisville, who has dismissed claims that religious liberty should exempt Davis from issuing licenses. \n \n“It will do nothing whatsoever for getting Kim Davis out of jail for Mike Huckabee to appear at a rally today. But it will certainly keep the temperature hot, and it brings attention to Mike Huckabee.” \n \nOn Monday, Davis’ lawyers took their case to a federal appeals court, asking that Davis be allowed to remove her name and title from marriage certificates issued in Rowan County so that she would not have to act against her conscience. \n \nCasey County Clerk Casey Davis, who recently finished riding a bike more than 400 miles across the state of Kentucky in solidarity with Kim Davis, said he was relieved she was being released. He is not related to her. \n \n“It’s been a total injustice for her being there to begin with,” he said. \n \nBut he said he is still not issuing any marriage licenses, and suspects the conflict could come to his county next. He said only one same-sex couple has inquired about a marriage license in his county and was told there were no licenses being issued, and that’s the last Davis heard from them. \n \nHe said he, too, would be willing to go to jail.
0628_63df4433-03c4-4d27-80f3-3c34050fde41	The filmmaker’s 1st work in 7 years is a sexually-explicit, stop-motion meditation on human connection A Charlie Kaufman film is always an occasion to be surprised and delighted and his newest film, “Anomalisa,” doesn’t disappoint. The film, which this weekend took the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and screened Sunday for media in Toronto, is a sexually-explicit, stop-motion story – I might even call it a meditation – about a middle-aged motivational speaker in search of human connection. The trick is, the writer of “Being John Malkovich” and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” has created an animated world in which everyone has the same face and the same voice except for his lead character, motivational speaker Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) and a lonely customer service rep, Lisa, voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Also Read: 'Trumbo' Toronto Review: Bryan Cranston and Jay Roach Have Fun With the Blacklist Stone’s wife speaks to him in the same white, male voice (Tom Noonan’s) as the room service clerk, the same voice as his son or the cab driver who picks him up at the Cincinnati airport. This choice recalls the “John Malkovich” scene in which Malkovich is at a restaurant and sees everyone with his face – he thinks he is going mad. But of course, in a Charlie Kaufman world, the rules of normalcy are always askew. In this invented world, everything is familiar yet always slightly off, such as how the faces of the characters appeared to be molded masks rather than skin. None of that takes away from the very human, familiar anxiety that Michael Stone is feeling – a disconnection from his family, boredom with everything in his world of motivational speaking and a desperate desire to make it all stop. The film is existential at its heart, with the surrealism that is Kaufman’s distinctive voice. He seeks connection with Lisa, who with her own voice and face is an anomaly, hence “Anomalisa,” but she is hardly special, hardly interesting. Her voice draws Stone in. This leads to a fascinating stop-motion sex scene between strangers and, presumably, an R-rating. This is the first film Kaufman has made since “Synechdoche” seven years ago, and the return of a filmic voice so original and, well, bent, is welcome indeed.
0629_0b292b72-f5b8-4db5-b6ca-8714265f59ad	She has been hiding her face during public appearances for years, but Sia Furler continues to go to bizarre lengths to disguise herself. \n\nThis time the Chandelier hit maker kept her appearance under wraps by dressing up like a human birthday present. \n\nThe 39-year-old was the lady of the hour as she attended the Miu Miu Women's Tales Dinner during the 72nd Venice Film Festival at Ca' Corner della Regina in Venice, Italy on Thursday. \n\n   \n   \nNow you Sia, now you don't! Sia Furler kept her appearance under wraps by dressing up like a human birthday present during the 72nd Venice Film Festival at Ca' Corner della Regina in Venice, Italy on Thursday \n\nSporting a peroxide blonde bob wig that covered the entirety of her face, the ARIA award winner – who was a major draw card at the dinner, headlining a talk on the night - topped off the unusual hairstyle with a large red bow. \n \nSia was even more playful with her look, as she covered her locks with an assortment of colourful polka-dot stickers which created the illusion of looking like a beautifully wrapped gift. \n\nThe You're Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile singer appeared to be shunning her own advice, as her expression was entirely concealed behind the mask. \n   \nParty pooper: The 39-year-old was the lady of the hour as she attended the Miu Miu Women's Tales Dinner with her husband Erik Anders Lang \n\nSia's attempt to go incognito had quite the opposite effect as onlookers were instantly drawn to her unusual ensemble.  \n\nArriving at the event with her doting American film maker husband Erik Anders Lang, Sia wore a bright orange and red horizontal stripe dress that could have easily passed as wrapping paper. \n\nRolling her sleeves up to reveal her tattooed arms, the Australian singer paired the look with a matching pair of red strappy high heels. \n   \nSia, is that you? The Chandeleir hit maker wore a bright orange and red horizontal stripe dress as she posed for photographs with Erik and American actress Whitney Cummings \n\nApart from her forearms, the only skin the star dared to bare were her legs from the knee down, as she revealed a glimpse of her sun kissed complexion. \n\nMeanwhile, her handsome beau had no trouble flashing his smile, as he dressed in a smart black suit and blue shirt and tie combination. \n\nDespite being camera shy, the performer posed for the obligatory red carpet photos alongside her beau and American actress Whitney Cummings.   \n   \nWiggin' out! Earlier in the day, Sia stuck to a familiar script as she covered her face underneath the same wig as she attended a photocall for short film series Women's Tales at the film festival \n\nThe Whitney star wore a black leather mini dress and matching heels which featured a fur pouf as her porcelain complexion were covered with a sheer makeup look and red lip. \n\nOther celebrities in attendance at the dinner included Dakota Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld and Julia Garner. \n\nEarlier in the day, Sia stuck to a familiar script as she covered her face underneath the same wig as she attended a photo call for short film series Women's Tales. \n   \nCan't Sia!

0630_124aeeb7-367c-416b-9787-c2f86bbfdc3d	WASHINGTON (CNN) — Top-level negotiations between Republican leaders in Congress and the White House to resolve multiple critical budget issues could begin “very soon,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. \n \nBut the talks could be marred before even getting started after McConnell insisted in a phone call last week with President Barack Obama that House and Senate Democratic leaders not be allowed at the table, a demand the President refused to accept, multiple officials told CNN. \n \nMcConnell has suggested for weeks he expected to open talks directly with the White House, bypassing Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders with whom he has tenuous relations. A spokesman for McConnell wouldn’t comment on why he wanted to bar Democrats from the talks. \n \nWhite House officials also declined to discuss the call, which took place last Thursday just before Obama met with Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office, according to a Pelosi aide. But they pointed to recent comments by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest who said that Democrats must be part of any negotiation. \n \nReid insisted he would be part of any negotiations. \n \n“We’ve been calling for responsible budget negotiations for months,” he said. “If there are any talks, I will be invited.” \n \nMcConnell announced at a press conference that the talks were set to begin. \n \n“The President and Speaker (John) Boehner and I spoke about getting started in a discussion last week and I would expect them to start very soon,” he said. \n \nNews of the anticipated but long-awaited talks came a day before Congress was set to prevent a shutdown by approving a temporary spending bill to keep the government operating through December 11. The stopgap measure would “allow time for cooler heads to prevail,” McConnell said. \n \nIt also came days after Boehner, a known dealmaker, complicated the process by announcing he would leave Congress at the end of October. It was not clear what impact his sudden departure would have on what will be his final major budget negotiation. But some Democrats — who fear Boehner’s replacement will cower to demands from the right not to cut a deal — said they hope Boehner will wrap up all the remaining issues before retiring. \n \n“I would hope that Boehner would make it easier on the people who are going to follow him,” Reid said. “Get it all done before he leaves.” \n \nIn an interview on Face the Nation Sunday, Boehner suggested he may want to do just that. \n \n“I don’t want to leave my successor a dirty barn. I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there,” Boehner said. \n \nWashington faces several deadlines in the coming weeks related to government funding, the debt ceiling, money for highway and infrastructure construction, whether to renew the Export-Import Bank, and a slew of expiring tax provisions that need to be renewed. \n \nMany Republicans want to break existing budget caps to increase spending for defense while most Democrats want to break the caps to increase funding for domestic programs. But the conservatives in the House who helped force Boehner’s exit say they want to rein in government spending and don’t want to break the caps at all. \n \nMcConnell said one of his top priorities in the talks will be to set a top line spending figure for this year and 2016, which would allow Congress to carry out a normal appropriations process next year, which will be complicated by the elections. Washington has run on “continuing resolutions” for some time, which don’t allow Congress to make changes to the way money is spent or to alter policies within government agencies. \n \n“Let us at least be honest. With a continuing resolution, no waste will be cut. No spending will be cut. No regulations will be stopped. And the debt will continue to mount,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said in a floor speech explaining why he would vote against the continuing resolution. \n   Cooling down means chowing down for animals at Audubon Zoo    Watch sexy guys struggle to pick the perfect red dress?!

Globetrotting galloper Red Cadeaux is set to contest his fifth Melbourne Cup in five weeks, so the old stayer surely knows every blade of grass at the famous Flemington racetrack. Even though he has never won the race, his three second-place efforts have ensured the Ed Dunlop-trained veteran is one of the most popular horses to have run in Australia.\n\nAnd at least one local organisation wants to ensure Red Cadeaux becomes a permanent presence up the road from the headquarters of Victorian racing when his days on the track are over.\n\nLiving Legends, the retirement home for top-class horses, is keen to persuade owner Ron Arculli – the former chairman of the Hong Kong Jockey Club – to at least let him board at the Melbourne venue for part of the year.\n\nLiving Legends derives its income through its sponsorship by corporate bookmaker Sportsbet and entry charges to visitors and school groups, and its officials reckon the property, just a couple of kilometres up the road from Melbourne Airport, would be an entirely appropriate spot for a horse with such a Melbourne affinity.\n\nAndrew Clarke, the CEO and veterinary director of the home, says the English-trained horse would be very welcome when he finally retires – and given his reputation in the city, it might encourage a few more visitors to contribute to its coffers.\n\n"We are working hard on trying to get Red Cadeaux here when he stops racing," he said.\n\n"There is a facility being built at Newmarket in England [where he is trained] and he has been promised there. But he has such a huge following here, our suggestion is for him to spend six months there and six months here." The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

0633_fbb4bc57-f43d-46b2-89e5-1fd12d7cab8e	Martina Hingis is already in the International Tennis Hall of Fame. But that's not good enough for her. She's going to keep winning championships until they build a new wing in her honor. The 34-year-old Swiss has reached top form after coming out of retirement late in 2013. For starters, she and Leander Paes won three mixed-doubles major titles this year -- something that hasn't been done since 1969. "The understanding we have for the game and each other is amazing," she said after they triumphed in the U.S. Open final last week. "Even if one thing doesn't work, we come up with a plan B or C, like we did today. I just feel like we're almost invincible going on court." Hingis could say the same thing about her connection with Sania Mirza, with whom she won the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open women's doubles titles this year. The player who was not so affectionately nicknamed Chucky, after the creepy horror-movie doll, initially retired from tennis following the 2002 season, citing chronic injuries. She was 22. But she returned to the game not long thereafter in World Team Tennis, the U.S. league where broken-down pros and former college players go for a low-key reminder of their salad days. But while hitting and giggling, Hingis realized something: she still loved competing. She has helped lead the Washington Kastles to five straight WTT championships. Hingis was the best women's player in the world for a couple years in the late 1990s. She won three of the four major singles titles in 1997, when she was all of 16. She also won the Australian Open in 1998 and '99. She was not a humble champion, once referring to herself as "The Queen" and dismissing 1998 Wimbledon champ Jana Novotna as "old and slow." And, let's face it, she got a little lucky in her singles career. The great Steffi Graf, 11 years her senior, was beset my injuries in '97, losing early in Melbourne and Roland Garros, and missing Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. (Hingis was 0-4 against Graf in Grand Slam tournaments in her career, including a memorable clash in the 1999 French Open final. The French Open is the one Grand Slam singles title Hingis failed to secure.) Then, of course, Venus and Serena Williams showed up, and Hingis' luck ended altogether. Hingis relied on guile, and that just wasn't enough against the Williams' athleticism and power. In 2013, after an aborted comeback in singles and a stint as a coach, Hingis decided to return to the tour solely as a doubles player. And it is here, in the team discipline, that she needs no luck at all. Her smart, precise, tactical game is perfectly suited to doubles. She won the women's doubles Grand Slam -- all four major tournaments in one season -- in 1998, partnering with Mirjana Lucic and Novotna. With the two women's doubles majors she's scored this year, she now has 11 total. (She also has four mixed-doubles majors, which is nice, but some players -- and a lot of fans -- view the mixed game as barely a step up from exhibition play.) She has no chance at catching the all-time doubles leaders. The legendary Martina Navratilova, after whom Hingis was named, won 31 women's doubles majors. But Hingis is padding an already impressive C.V., and -- now more mature and enjoying herself on court -- she's winning over new fans. Hingis has proved something no one thought possible: there can be a second act in tennis. And she's making the most of it. The way she and Mirza have melded their talents on court, you have to like Hingis' chances at winning a second doubles Grand Slam. Even the great Navratilova never did that. -- Douglas Perry How great is that? @mhingis just refuses to lose!

0635_15778205-aacb-40fa-88c2-2b07afc39dcd	Radio Rentals owner Thorn Group has been forced to update how it checks its customers' ability to pay for rentals, and is repaying up to $1 million in overpayments to dole recipients.\n\nThe moves follow ongoing scrutiny of Thorn by the corporate cop which continues to question its compliance with responsible lending obligations.\n\nBut Thorn managing director, James Marshall, has rejected the claims of a former Thorn finance team employee who told Fairfax Media sales at the company had declined by 30 per cent since the update in April to the poverty index figures it uses to determine customers' ability to make repayments.\n\nResponsible lending laws that came into affect in 2010 require lenders to check borrowers' claims about their income and expenditure tally with the known cost of living to ensure any repayments on a loan will not push them below the poverty line.\n\nMr Marshall said it is true Thorn does not update its figures every quarter because the changes are often minor but there had been a longer "period" until April when the figures were out of date for the Henderson Poverty Index that it uses.\n\nThe HPI has been compiled by the Melbourne Institute since 1973 and is updated every quarter. As of March 2015, the poverty line was calculated at $958 a week for a couple, one of which is working, with two dependent children. The poverty line in March 2011 was about $874.\n\nFollowing ongoing discussions with ASIC since April, it is now moving to use other measures to assess creditworthiness, including assessing people's cost of living based on where they live.\n\n"It has become apparent to us that ASIC doesn't really like the HPI. We agree it is a really blunt instrument. EY is now checking on Thorn's procedures for checking customer's ability to pay and will recommend updates to its methods," Mr Marshall said.\n\nHowever, he said there had been no downturn in sales as a result of the change, and "installations" of goods that it leases have increased in the past six months compared to the previous corresponding period.\n\nOn Friday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission released a report it commissioned from RMIT showing that people were paying the equivalent of up to 885 per cent interest to lease products, and the poorest were paying the highest interest rates.\n\nMr Marshall questioned the "subjective" language of ASIC's report and the size of the sample for RMIT's study, which is based on just two lessors. He said Thorn's repayment rates amount to about 2.6 times the cost price of the product, or 250 per cent.\n\nASIC said it is continuing investigations into several lessors to check if they are complying with responsible lending laws. There are no formal investigations into Thorn but the regulator confirmed it still has "concerns" Thorn is not complying with responsible lending laws. "We have ongoing concerns about standards of conduct in this market sector, and we are currently reviewing specific lessors for compliance with the requirements of the National Credit Act," the regulator said on Friday.\n\nIt pointed out consumer lease companies, which as well as Thorn include rival Flexigroup, are not subject to any caps on the margin they can earn on repayments above the actual cost of goods. By contrast payday lenders cannot charge annual rates of more than 48 per cent.\n\nASIC deputy commissioner Peter Kell said it has submitted its report to the government review of national consumer credit laws. This is looking at whether caps on payday loans are appropriate and whether they should be extended to consumer leases.\n\nMr Marshall admitted to claims it has been overpaid between $700,000 and $1 million by customers on the dole via a government direct debit system called CentrePay because customers neglect to stop repayments when the lease is paid in full. CentrePay allows people on CentreLink to set up direct payments for essential items like electricity and education.\n\nMr Marshall put this down to errors in legacy IT systems and said the company is now working on returning the money to customers. He said the amount would not have a significant affect on its 2016 earnings.\n\nA Credit Suisse report published in March estimated half of Thorn's revenue comes from CentrePay. Mr Marshall has said this is inaccurate but Credit Suisse stands by its analysis.\n\nThorn Group's share price had fallen by 7.2 per cent since Friday morning to $2.32 by the close of trade on Wednesday. It has fallen by 24 per cent since December 31 when it was at $3.11.\n\nThe government recently banned any lease company from receiving payments from CentrePay unless it has a credit licence, which Thorn Group does.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Labor Senator Doug Cameron to ban all lease companies from CentrePay. It still needs to be passed by the House of Representatives.\n\nA spokeswoman for listed lease company Flexigroup said it does not receive any payments from CentrePay.
0636_d7dcdd8b-d0f4-4bec-b6e0-bfc364baf0d3	Story highlights Officers circled the man, who was in a wheelchair, telling him to put his hands up The chief says the handicapped man reached for the gun; his mother disputes this claim \nHis hands don't rise. Shots are fired. And the man keels over out of his wheelchair and onto the ground. \n\nThe police chief in Wilmington, Delaware, defended his officers Thursday. The handicapped man, Jeremy McDole, was armed with a .38 caliber gun -- the same one he'd apparently used on himself earlier, Chief Bobby Cummings said. And he never complied with the officers' requests. \n\nInstead, "when Mr. McDole began to remove the weapon from his waist, the officers engaged him," Cummings said. In other words, the officers opened fire because they were concerned McDole might fire his weapon at them. \n\nBut the handicapped man's mother saw it differently. \n\nPhyllis McDole alluded to a video -- which Cummings acknowledged but said he hasn't authenticated -- which she said shows that her son "didn't pull a weapon. He had his hands in his lap." \n\nIn the footage, a witness can be heard saying "put your hands up" and "he's reaching again." But it's not obvious what exactly the handicapped man was doing with his hands just before the shots rang out. \n\nYet Phyllis McDole -- who spoke at the same news conference as Cummings, despite their obvious differences of opinion -- doesn't understand why her son died. He was 28-years-old and paralyzed from the waist down, she points out. \n\nThe mother said, "This is unjust." \nMayor: 'We want answers' \nThe call came in around 3 p.m. Wednesday that there was a man suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound who was still armed, Cummings explained. \n\nA number of officers arrived and approached McDole. Their guns were pointed toward his stationary wheelchair as they circled, shouting their demands that he let go of the weapon. It wasn't evident from the video if the gun was ever in his hands as police approached. \n\nThis took place before a few moments of relative silence. \n\nThat's when, the Wilmington police chief said, McDole "began to remove the weapon from his waist, the officers engaged him and -- as a result of the injuries Mr. McDole sustained -- he lost his life." \n\nHours after the shooting, the loss of life seemed about the only thing that police and McDole's mother agreed on. \n\nWilmington Mayor Dennis Williams promised at Thursday's news conference that the family "will be notified step-by-step throughout the investigation. \n\nAnd he concurred with Phyllis McDole in at least one respect: "We want answers."

She was eventually jailed over what she’s deeming a religious objection, making her an instant hero among a certain subset.\nhttp://gawker.com/kim-davis-for-...\nDavis was freed this week and is expected to return to work on Friday or Monday. But her deputy clerk, Brian “Judas” Mason, says the office will continue to issue licenses over her objections.\nVia the AP:\nMason said Wednesday that licenses would be granted to anyone seeking them. He told reporters that if Davis tells him to stop, he will tell her no. Mason says he would have to follow the judge’s order to issue licenses.\nIn the meantime, Davis is facing a licensing issue of her own, from the band Survivor, which—much like her underlings—would prefer not to be associated with her.\nhttp://jezebel.com/survivor-is-pi...\nImage via AP.

0638_5d30f92b-9996-41e9-a218-ae14e7877735	Global superstar Lionel Richie has revealed he has never made love to his own music. The Hello singer told Piers Morgan "absolutely not" when asked, but did confess that when he was in the Commodores it was a different story. Appearing on Morgan's Life Stories, he said: "It would be Three Times A Lady. I'm no fool, because that was our first worldwide hit."\n\nOver the years, Richie has made headlines for his music and personal life in equal measure.\n\nIn 1968 he joined the Commodores as a saxophonist and singer, and enjoyed a long, successful career with the band.\n\nHe duetted with Diana Ross in 1981, on the soundtrack for the film Endless Love, and the song was so successful it prompted Richie to start exploring a solo career.\n\nThe following year he released his self-titled debut album.\n\nFast forward to 1984 and he released Hello, which went on to become a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nTo-date, the lyrics "Hello, is it me you're looking for?" remain quoted around the globe.\n\nRichie adopted his daughter, Nicole, after seeing her on stage at a Prince concert in 1984.\n\nShe was the daughter of a bandmate, and he stepped in to care for her.\n\nA close friend of socialite Paris Hilton's, Nicole's party lifestyle was splashed across tabloids many times.\n\nRichie revealed that he cancelled a tour he was on following a phone call from her, asking for help.\n\n"I said 'me and your mother', who didn't get along that well, 'me and your mother are checking into rehab with you'."\n\nThese days Nicole is on the straight and narrow, married to musician Joel Madden and mother to two children.\n\nWhen asked by Morgan how he felt about becoming a grandfather as a "handsome pop icon", he said: "It scared me to death. I'm in tight pants and she is saying 'Grandpa'. What are we talking about? And all of the sudden the word 'sexy' goes out of your life right quick. But I was so thrilled when the little 'pop-pop' showed up, I mean I'll take that position any day of the week, I love it." \n\nRichie's own personal life, specifically his marriages and divorces, have been headlines in their own right. \n\nHis first wife, Brenda, was his university sweetheart, but the marriage fell to pieces after Brenda caught him with his girlfriend, Diane. \n\n"It was my fault mainly," he said. "The best thing was I fell in love, the worst thing was I was still married. Yikes." \n\nAn altercation between Diane and Brenda lead to the police being called, and Richie described it as "a thrilla in Manila. It was more screaming and hollering than it was fighting". \n\nHe married Diane and they had two children, Miles and Sofia, but they divorced in 2004. \n\n"I made a promise that I would not go back to work," he explained about their marriage ending. "One day I knew I was in trouble because I just happened to stumble back into the recording studio. Over."\n\nDespite many other musicians of that era delving into drugs, Richie says his need to "be in control at all times" has stopped him taking drugs. \n\nHe recalls a night spent with Bob Marley in New York saying: "Bob said 'come down to the room' and we must partake in a room that looks like it has been set on fire. And it was at that point I realised that whatever I was smoking in Alabama was Lipton tea but I remembered clearly taking the rest of that night trying to remember who the hell I was!"\n\nPiers Morgan's Life Stories airs on ITV on Friday September 4 at 9pm.
0639_9bb50b82-828b-4cc0-a253-ada5fc338135	The county official in rural Kentucky who has become the focal point for resistance to the U.S. Supreme Court's gay marriage decision will appear this morning before a federal judge to explain why she should not be held in contempt of court. \n \nThe judge ordered Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis and all of her deputies to appear before him at 11 a.m. Lawyers for four couples who sought marriage licenses from her but were turned down urged the judge "to impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous to compel Davis' immediate compliance without further delay." \n "I let her know how proud I am of her for not abandoning her religious convictions and standing strong for religious liberty."   \nShe stopped issuing marriage licenses a few hours after the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in June, saying that granting licenses to gay couples would violate her religious convictions. \n \nFederal District Court Judge David Bunning last month ordered her to resume issuing the marriage licenses. She asked a federal appeals court and the US Supreme Court to lift his order, but both declined. Nonetheless, she has continued to defy it. \n \nRepublican presidential candidate and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee voiced his support for Davis on Wednesday, saying he talked with her on the telephone. \n \n"I let her know how proud I am of her for not abandoning her religious convictions and standing strong for religious liberty," he said in a statement. \n \nAnd the president of Kentucky's state senate, Republican Robert Stivers, urged the judge to hold off on any decision about contempt of court until the legislature meets next year to clarify state marriage law. \n \nUntil then, Davis "cannot be reasonably expected to determine her duties until such time as either the governor by executive order or the General Assembly by legislation provides guidance and clarification." \n "It is time for the clerk and the county to follow the law."  \nLawyers for Davis said in court filings late Wednesday that she should not be held in contempt for disobeying the judge's August order, because she cannot obey it. \n \n"Davis is unable to comply with the order," her lawyers say, "because it irreparably and irreversibly violates her conscience." They cite federal court decisions, including a U.S. Supreme Court case, holding that someone cannot be held in contempt when complying with an order is factually impossible. \n \nA question for the judge will be whether she is unable to comply or, instead, unwilling. \n \nHer lawyers also say because the underlying issue — whether she has a constitutional right, on religious grounds, to refuse to issue marriage licenses — has yet to be decided, it's too soon to consider any question of contempt. \n \nKentucky law requires marriage licenses to be issued by county clerks, and the state prescribes the form, which includes the name of the county and the clerk. \n \n"To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God's definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience," she said Monday. The Liberty Counsel, a nationwide group of lawyers who litigate on behalf of religious freedom, is representing her. \n \n"You don't lose your conscience rights or you religious freedom rights or constitutional rights just because you accept public employment," says Matt Staver, a lawyer for the organization. \n \nBut the U.S. Supreme Court has held that while public employees have the right to speak out on matter of public concern, just as any citizen would, their First Amendment rights concerning their jobs are different. \n \n"When a citizen enters government service, the citizen by necessity must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom," the court said in a 2006 decision involving a prosecutor's comments about the work of his colleagues. \n \nThough that decision involved the First Amendment's protection of free expression, legal experts say the same principle limits the freedom of religion of public employees. \n \n"She waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job," said Prof. Steve Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law. \n \nAdds Prof. Jonathan Adler of Case Western University School of Law, "Insofar as the state's definition of an acceptable marriage differs from her own, Davis is obligated to follow the state's rule so long as she maintains her current office." \n     \n Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, right, talks with David Moore following her office's refusal to issue marriage licenses at the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Ky., Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015. Although her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied, Davis still refuses to issue marriage licenses.  Timothy D. Easley / AP \n \nDavis's lawyers have argued that the state has an obligation to accommodate her religious objections if doing so would be reasonable. \n \nOne option, they say, would be to change the marriage license form to remove the name of the county clerk. \n \nAnother would be to have the state, not counties, issue marriage licenses. \n \nSuch a proposal was offered in July by 57 of Kentucky's 120 county clerks, who urged Gov. Steve Beshear to call the legislature into a special session to make the change. \n \nBeshear said Tuesday that the legislature can address the issue, if it chooses, when it convenes next year. "I see no need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money calling a special session of the General Assembly when 117 of 120 county clerks are doing their jobs." \n \nTwo other county clerks, like Davis, are also declining to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \n \nIn ordering Davis to issue marriage licenses, Judge Bunning said the issue isn't merely accommodating her religious beliefs. He said her refusal "promotes her own religious convictions at the expense of others." \n \nThough the federal government is not directly involved in the Rowan County dispute, Kentucky's U.S. Attorney, Kerry Harvey, said Wednesday that his office has "grave concerns about the reported failure to comply with the court's order. Government officials are free to disagree with the law but not disobey it." \n \nHe added, "It is time for the clerk and the county to follow the law."
0640_0b3e7d8e-f1da-496c-8826-09c1d5e89b08	Any internal memos about Maxim  ditching its bro-tastic, raunchy image in favor of a more fashionable, woman-friendly perspective seem to have missed the inboxes of the staff at the magazine’s Korean edition. The cover of the September issue of Maxim  Korea features Korean movie star Kim Byung-Ok, who is known for portraying dangerous villains, puffing on a cigarette. There’s only one word to sum up his noir-ish fashion style: Cool. \n \nAnd what makes that so disturbing to some is that Byung-Ok is smoking his cancer stick while standing next to a car that has a woman’s duct-taped lower legs hanging out of the trunk—and the trunk’s lid is resting on top of her legs. \n \n“So girls like ‘bad guys’? This is what a bad guy looks like. Dying for him, right?" reads the copy on the mag’s cover next to Byung-OK, reads an  Avaaz petition  started by a Korea resident named Megal P. The petition asks  Maxim  Korea to remove the issue from stores and recall any sold issues. “Is it ok to capitalize on the ongoing pain of real victims, just for sexual jokes and beautification of distorted male images?” wrote the author. More than 9,400 people have signed it so far. \n \nBut Megal P. isn’t stopping with a hypothetical question and the request for the issue to be recalled: “We also plead the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Korea Publication Ethics Commission to make a public announcement regarding the issue and come up with measures to stop a next potential case similar to this,” reads the petition. \n   \n(Photo: Facebook) \n   \nA multi-page photo spread inside the issue also shows pictures of a woman in a car trunk, along with “an abandoned dead body in a black plastic bag, and eyes looking up the perpetrator,” Megal P. wrote. A video featuring Byung-Ok that was posted on Maxim  Korea's YouTube channel last week also shows footage of the actor looking down at something in a trunk and then shutting the lid. \n \nRELATED:  If Kids Think the Models Are Dead, There’s Definitely a Problem With Fashion Ads \n \nThe implication of the photos and video is that Byung-Ok may have murdered a woman and is having a smoke while disposing her body.  \n \nThe petition’s author cites statistics about violence and sexual assault against women as reasons the cover is irresponsible. According to the 2010 Korea National Survey of Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence , 53.8 percent of respondents who had been married experienced spousal abuse in the previous year, and 16.7 percent suffered physical abuse. Korea is also ranked 117th out of 142 countries on the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index 2014 , which measures gaps between women and men in areas such as health, education, economy, and politics.   \n \nIn a statement to Women You Should Know , Youngbi Lee, the editor-in-chief of Maxim Korea defended the cover as depicting the actor “directing a scene of film crime.” \n \nRELATED: What If Fashion Ads Objectified Men the Same Scary Way They Do Women? \n \n“As you can see, in the context of the cover we did depict the crime of murder and body abandonment in a film noir way, but there’s no hint of a sexual offense in the picture, and no fantasizing of sex crimes either,” wrote Lee. “Unlike some people’s concerns, we never intended to beautify sex crimes as sex fantasy. Films direct scenes for delivering a story and mood. We hope you can also see the cover as expressing a scene of crime to show the contexts of this issue.” \n \nThe petition's author  doesn't seem to be buying Maxim  Korea's rationalizations. \n \n“ Maxim targets adult males and that’s no secret. Sexual objectification of women is its daily work and expertise,” wrote Megal P. “It is just natural that sexual crimes are implied when a sex-related medium deals with a male criminal and a victimized woman. Still, Maxim just chose to say ‘it is a crime against a woman that isn’t necessarily a sex crime’.”

According to Zacks, “WPX Energy’s loss per share in the second quarter of 2015 was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Total revenues also missed the mark. WPX Energy has suffered from the ongoing softness in commodity prices. The company expects to maximize returns and margins by scaling down its historically gas-weighted portfolio to make room for more oil production and oil inventory. The acquisition of RKI Exploration & Production will give WPX Energy entry into the oil rich Permian Basin. A significant presence in several oil rich basins and ability to lower operating expenses will help the company to improve its performance over the long term. On a cautionary note, highly competitive, regulated, capital intensive oil and gas exploration operations do not always result in commercial quantities.” \n\n7/28/2015 – WPX Energy had its “outperform” rating reaffirmed by analysts at Imperial Capital.

0643_932f3f1c-cdd8-4c22-a823-2b513847e3b7	DURHAM, N.C. , Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Bronto Software, the leader in commerce marketing automation and a NetSuite (NYSE: N) company, today announced the release of its "Holiday Planning Report: What Holiday Shoppers Want, How Retailers Plan to Deliver." The new research examines consumer holiday shopping preferences, guides commerce marketers on when to target certain demographics and provides insight into effective holiday promotions. \n\n"More consumer choices and multi-channel purchasing options have disrupted the traditional timing of holiday shopping," said Jim Davidson , head of research at Bronto. "Retailers must understand when and where their customers are shopping and what promotions resonate with particular demographics. Our research confirmed some assumptions and uncovered a few surprises. This insight will help commerce marketers better understand consumer expectations this holiday season." \n\nHoliday Shopper Demographics \nThe data reinforces how important it is for marketers to understand their target audience and know when those consumers plan to begin their holiday shopping. According to the report, many marketers begin their holiday marketing campaigns long before most shoppers hit the stores, search the Internet or break out the credit card. This may lead to shopper fatigue and frustration, causing engagement and sales to decline during the busiest time of the year. Armed with this data, marketers can ensure their campaigns are relevant and timely. For instance: \nOverall, 19% of customers and 20% of marketers are aligned in kicking off the holiday season, saying they start shopping/marketing before September. From there, 60% of marketers will kick off their campaigns in September or October when only 24% of customers start their shopping.  Millennials are more likely than other age groups to wait for the highly celebrated Black Friday: 22% of 18-29 year olds start their shopping on that day.  The largest age group of consumers who start shopping before September are seniors aged 65+ (23%) closely followed by those aged 50-64 (21%).  Older shoppers also represent the largest group of last-minute shoppers, with 16% of those over 65 and 13% of those 50-64 waiting until after Cyber Monday to start shopping.  Interestingly, 53% of retailers launch holiday marketing campaigns in September or earlier, but more than half of all shoppers surveyed (52%) said they don't plan to make their first purchase until October or November. \nAligning Holiday Promotions \nCustomers have grown so accustomed to promotions that a large percentage refuse to shop at a retailer that doesn't offer them. Some highlights include: \nFree shipping is huge - 38% of shoppers say they won't shop with a retailer that doesn't offer it, yet only 28% of all retailers plan to offer free shipping on all purchases. Among online-only retailers, only 18% plan to offer the same deal.  The interest in flash sales declines with age. More than half (54%) of all Millennials love them versus only 39% of shoppers aged 30-39 and 16% of shoppers aged 50-64.  An overwhelming majority of retailers (70%) consider "door busters" effective sales tools even though just 28% of holiday shoppers love them. \nMobile Device Disconnect \nConsumers say they will use their mobile devices extensively for holiday shopping, but few plan to use them to make purchases. Perhaps the biggest disconnect we uncovered is how retailers expect consumers to use their devices. This disconnect could cost sales during the busiest shopping time of the year because retailers may focus budget and efforts in the wrong places. Some highlights include: \nOnly 19% of holiday shoppers plan to purchase from a tablet, and 22% from a smartphone.  Consumers will use mobile devices to search for the best deal: 65% will look for promotions and coupons, 63% will check prices on that store's website and 61% will search for lower prices at another store or site.  Conversely, among the functions retailers expect consumers to use their mobile devices for the most is to read reviews (61%). More than 60% of retailers expect shoppers to use their devices to research their return and exchange policies when, in fact, only 19% of shoppers say they will use their mobile device for that purpose. \nBronto partnered with Ipsos, a global market research company, to survey shoppers about their holiday shopping habits, their mobile device preferences and retailer expectations. The survey consisted of 1,000 consumers in the United States . A separate survey focused on how 100 leading retailers plan to meet holiday customer expectations. \n\nFor the full results, download "Holiday Planning Report: What Holiday Shoppers Want, How Retailers Plan to Deliver."  \n\nAbout Bronto Software \nBronto Software, a NetSuite (NYSE: N) company, provides a cloud-based commerce marketing automation platform to mid-market and enterprise organizations worldwide.

0644_9cbb3e65-171e-4c12-83c0-84a49d5e28db	A BMX cyclist who knocked over a pensioner – who later died – in Hereford city centre today failed to convince judges that his one-year jail term was too harsh. \n \nDarryl Gittoes was riding the bike with no brakes, no bell and a flat tyre on Commercial Street in July of last year when he was in collision with Mary Evans. \n \nMrs Evans, a 73-year-old mother-of-three, was knocked to the floor of the pedestrianised street. \n \nThe pensioner hit her head on the pavement and suffered a fractured skull before she died in hospital eight days later. \n \nGittoes, of Homestead, Putson, Hereford, was jailed for 12 months at Worcester Crown Court in June after pleading guilty to causing bodily harm by wilful misconduct when riding a bicycle. \n \nAnd today, the 21-year-old argued that his jail term was "manifestly excessive" as the judge had not given sufficient weight to his guilty plea and the remorse he had shown. \n \nLondon's Appeal Court heard Gittoes had found the bike in a skip and had been warned against riding through the area where vehicles are banned between 10.30am and 4.30pm. \n \nBut as the father-of-one weaved amid shoppers, he hit Mrs Evans who was from Droitwich and had been shopping in the city with a friend. \n \nJohn Dyer, speaking on behalf of Gittoes, told the appeal judges he had written to her husband Robert accepting the awful consequences were entirely his fault and asked that the sentence be reduced. \n \nThe two Appeal Court judges, however, unanimously dismissed his request. \n \nMr. Justice Lewis, sitting with Mr. Justice Holroyde, said Gittoes had a number of previous convictions and was on bail at the time of the offence. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nHe agreed with the trial judge who said it was a “bad case of wilful misconduct which had “the gravest consequences.” \n \nHe said his actions had caused the death of an innocent person and although he had shown remorse and tried to turn his life around, the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive and must stand.
0645_8adfbf60-ed0c-4111-9628-e204cae1def8	The Isle of Harris Distillery has opened in the Outer Herbrides of Scotland, revealing plans to launch its first single malt Scotch whisky in around four years’ time.  \nThe Isle of Harris Distillery is only the second distillery to be built in the Outer Hebrides \n \nDubbed The Social Distillery, it is the first commercial distillery to be built of the Isle of Harris and is only the second distillery in the Outer Hebrides. The result of a seven-year project, the Tarbet-based site will provide 20 local jobs. \n \nTouted as having the potential to “open up an entirely new whisky region for Scotland” , the distillery has been founded by musicologist Anderson Bakewell, while former Marks & Spencer and Diageo chairman Simon Erlanger has stepped in as managing director. \n \nRon MacEachran, former chief financial officer for Whyte & Mackay, has also been appointed director. \n \n“It is on this special island that conditions prevail for the production and maturation of a unique and exceedingly fine malt whisky,” Bakewell, who is also chairman of the company. \n \n“As if that was not enough, we have every expectation that it should inspire creative initiatives – entrepreneurial, cultural and social – for the benefit of the island’s future, helping to retain those here and attract back those who left.” \n \nAnnually, The Isle of Harris Distillery will produce 300,000 bottles of its single malt Scotch whisky, called The Hearach, which is the Gaelic name for an inhabitant of Harris. \n \nThe first batch of The Hearach is expected to be released in four years’ time and will be limited to 1,916 bottles – the same as the number of Harris residents. Those who pre-order the first batch will receive a lifetime of free distillery tours and their name inscribed on a wall of wooden staves in the distillery warehouse. \n \nThe distillery claims that cool, humid and temperate weather of the island will have a “unique effect” on its whisky, which will feature “more complex” flavours from the wood of the barrels. \n \nA limited number of casks from the first year’s production have been made available for sale, but the first year’s allocation has already sold out. \n \nThe company will also produce a gin made using sugar kelp harvested from the seas surrounding the island, which will be exclusively available from the distillery. \n \nAttracting finance from 17 investors in Europe, the US and the Far East, the distillery raised a total of £8.3m in equity and £3.1m from grants. \n \nIn addition to an equity investment of £1.5m from the Scottish Investment Bank, the project has been backed by £1.9m in public funding from the Scottish Government’s Food Processing, Marketing and Co- operation scheme and £1.3m from Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE). \n \nIsle of Harris Distillery marked its opening with an official ceremony today (Thursday 24 September). \n \nDespite export declines , a number of Scotch whisky distilleries are set to open in the coming years, as this roundup shows . \n  [embedded content]   Tweet     Pin It   \n This entry was posted on Thursday, September 24th, 2015 at 10:37 am\t\t\t\t\t\tand is filed under Headline , News .\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.

0647_2f398e26-ee53-49c8-8c25-43bea3d021b4	Tatton Sykes Monument \n \nTerry Fletcher \n   \nTerry Fletcher avoids touristy knick-knackery and enjoys the olde worlde charms of the Wolds around Wetwang \n  \nThe Yorkshire Wolds sometimes feel like a time capsule, a remnant of a quieter, more peaceful England before the coming of motorways and mass tourism. Aloof from the hustle and bustle, it is an often deserted landscape interspersed with picturesque villages that have grown around village ponds and sky-tickling steeples. It changes slowly with the seasons: in spring the green is splashed with day-glo yellow fields of oil seed rape, in high summer it turns golden with ripening wheat and barley and in winter it becomes the palest of brown corduroy as vast fields of chalky soil go under the plough in neat furrows. \n\nBecause it is not a national park nor designated in any way, the byways tend to be empty and the villages have been spared the tweeness and knick-knackery that afflict so many of the visitor honeypots of the Moors and Dales. No telly-inspired Heartbeat Country or Herriot trails here. \n\nDIRECTIONS \n\n1. This ramble sets off from the peaceful if quaintly-named village of Wetwang and traverses field paths and an old drovers’ road to visit a spectacular monument. It offers no drama or adrenaline, just a few hours passed amid a rolling arable landscape that might have been created especially to soothe the soul. \n\n2. By the duck pond turn down the side of the village pub towards Sledmere. After 100 yards take a signed public footpath leading between cottages on the right. It leads through a play area and out through a gap in the hedge opposite. Turn left down the side of field and follow its boundary along the bottom to reach a sunken track. Turn left down this heading towards Station Farm. Turn right in front of this and follow the lane onwards aiming for the slender needle of the Sykes Monument on the skyline. \n\n3. When the lane reaches Grange Farm do not enter the farmyard but instead followed the arrowed path around to the left. Ignore a signed bridleway half way round but continue following the yellow arrows around the farm to continue your original line traversing the foot of two fields to reach a chalk-surfaced farm track and turn left up it. Follow it briefly towards a line of trees and where the track turns right carry straight on to the trees and pass through the narrow woodland and press on directly ahead to the next line of trees. \n\n4. The path climbs to a pair of gates and immediately beyond joins a deeply-rutted green lane. The return route turns left here but it would be a shame not to visit the monument so first head rightwards to visit the tower.It is 120ft high and was built in memory of Sir Tatton Sykes the fourth Baronet, who was by all accounts, a liberal landlord by the standards of his day and a much-loved countryman, known as “t’Aud Squire”. He married at the age of 50, fathered eight children and lived to be 90. The monument, which resembles an earthbound rocket of Whitby and Mansfield stone, was built in 1865 and has been a prominent Wolds landmark ever since and a jewel of the Sledmere estate, which has been owned by the Sykes family for 250 years. \n\n5. From the monument, head back along the green lane, an old drivers’ road, which is followed unerringly as it traverses the side of the shallow valley with extensive views. After a couple of miles (3km) it reaches a road. If time is pressing this would provide a short cut back to Wetwang. However cross over and carry on along the green lane for another mile of so (2km) to a second road. \n\n6. Again, cross over still following the green lane. The right of way continues for another 100 yards or so to where a footpath sign on the left points diagonally back through crops to the road you have just crossed. Wear and tear on the ground, however, suggests that most people, having crossed the road, simply turn left up the inside of the hedge beside the road, an arrangement which would avoid trampling crops and may suit both walkers and farmer alike. \n\n7. Both routes lead to a signed gap in the hedge where the right of way crosses the road to where another signpost directs walkers diagonally across the field towards Wetwang. A stile points the way across and into a large field which is crossed diagonally to a gate by farm buildings almost in the far right hand corner. Another gate leads out onto a side road. Go down this with houses to one side and fields on the other to the T-junction. Turn right to get back to the village pond. \n\nFACTFILE \n\nStart/finish: By the village pond on the A166 at Wetwang \n\nDistance: 7miles/11km \n\nTime: 3 hours \n\nTerrain: Field paths and a drovers’ road \n\nParking: On street in the village centre \n\nRefreshments: Pub and shops in Wetwang \n\nMaps: OS Explorer 294 Market Weighton and Yorkshire Wolds Central and OS Explorer 300 Howardian Hills and Malton.
0648_c23d1bce-cf98-4838-9cb9-6ea44dcf34fb	© . Jimmy Morales, Guatemalan presidential candidate for the National Convergence Front, arrives at the media center of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in Guatemala City \n\nGUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - A comic actor who ran on an anti-corruption ticket has eased into Guatemala's presidential election run-off while a former first lady and conservative businessman are in a close battle to go up against him in the second round. \n\nJimmy Morales, 46, has promised a transparent government if he wins the presidency in a second round vote on October 25, responding to public outrage over a corruption scandal that forced Otto Perez to resign as president last week. \n\nAs votes trickled in on Monday, Morales had 24 percent support with 97.5 percent of polling stations counted. That was far short of the 50 percent needed for an outright victory, but he still had a clear lead over his rivals. \n\nSandra Torres, the ex-wife of former President Alvaro Colom, nudged into second place with 19.61 percent while conservative businessman Manuel Baldizon, who had until recently been favored to win, was on 19.55 percent. \n\nThe second-placed candidate will face Morales in the run-off. \n\nMorales surged late in the campaign, helped in part by his slogan "not corrupt, not a thief." \n\nHe played on his humble roots selling bananas and used clothes on the streets as a youth, and wooed crowds with jokes and references to a TV show he produced and starred in with his brother Sammy called "Moralejas" or "Morals," in which the pair dress up as spies and mafia hoods in comedy sketches. \n\n"My program in a nutshell: complete openness," Morales said as his place in the run-off was assured, vowing to propose forming a constitutional assembly alongside the country's discredited Congress if he wins the run-off. \n\nCritics say Morales' party is controlled by right-wing military figures. He denies that and defines himself as a centrist who would fight poverty by improving education and decentralize the budget and government powers. \n\nHis plan also includes giving out smartphones to children and tackle corruption. \n\nTorres has vowed to fight poverty by increasing social spending by 0.5 percent of gross domestic product, while Baldizon has promised to combat tax evasion, promote government austerity, modernize the state and curb corruption. \n\nBaldizon's campaign was tainted by a separate graft scandal, when his vice presidential running mate, Edgar Barquin, a former central bank chief, was accused of criminal association and influence trafficking by a powerful United Nations-backed anti-graft commission. Barquin has not been charged. \n\nPerez resigned as president on Thursday and he spent election day in jail while a judge considered charging him over a customs corruption racket that plunged the country into its worst political crisis in two decades. \n\nCongress has sworn in Perez' vice president, Alejandro Maldonado, to fill out his term until power is handed over to the eventual winner in January. \n\nGuatemala is Central America's largest economy and the next president inherits a poverty rate that remains stubbornly high despite nearly uninterrupted economic growth since the end of a 1960-96 civil war.

This view suddenly appears, and there’s space for a couple of cars to park.

The road is fairly straight at this point, so the view is pretty much 180° from left to right.\n\nThis is made up of over 160 photos, though some aren’t visible in the final result.\n\nI first took a good coverage of shots with my Voigtlander 40mm Nokton Classic lens, until I knew I had enough to make the basic pano in the middle. I then switched to my Leica Elmar 135mm, and took plenty of shots of the more interesting detailed bits.\n\nThe whole thing is put together entirely in Affinity Photo. I put all the 40mm lens shots together first, and saved a snapshot so I could always revert to that. I put all the shots making up that basic pano into a group of layers, to keep things a bit more tidy, then imported all the 135mm shots (over 90 of them). I slowly gathered these into groups that went together, and built several of them as extra panos to go around the edge of the main pano. I think the end result is really seven panos, but all presented as one.\n\nThe final result was 14,856 pixels across.

0652_c903a678-e4a3-4397-a247-fe8de306a607	HARTFORD — While progress is being made to tackle a customer backlog and long lines at state Department of Motor Vehicles branches following a major computer overhaul, the commissioner warned Friday that lengthy waits could resume next week. \n \nCommissioner Andres Ayala Jr. said typically there are longer lines after a holiday. \n      \nDMV employees at branch offices don’t work on Mondays, so they worked a half-day Friday and won’t be working today in order to have time off for Monday’s Labor Day holiday, which is required under their labor contracts. \n \n“The lines are more due to pent-up demand of having to shut down early on Friday and not being able to take care of folks on Saturday. It’s not necessarily the upgrade of our computer system that’s at fault,” Ayala said. \n \nBranches will reopen Tuesday. \n \nLast month, DMV branches were closed for a week as the staff completed work on a new computer system that allows customers to conduct more transactions online. State officials urged people to hold off from visiting the DMV following the shutdown, and granted a 60-day extension on renewal dates for driver’s licenses, ID cards and vehicle registrations through Oct. 10. But many people rushed to the branches anyway and found long lines. \n \nWhile the lines have persisted — crowds at the Norwich DMV exceeded the building’s capacity on Thursday — Ayala said improvements are being made. In the first couple of days after the branches reopened, employees stayed until 11 p.m. to help customers. Ayala said some branches are now wrapping up work around 6 p.m. while others are able to close on time. Workers typically stop taking new customers at 4 p.m. \n \nAyala said many people don’t have to visit a branch to complete their transactions. As of Wednesday, there have been 34,671 transactions conducted at the branches since the reopening. Of those, 9,176 could have been completed online. \n \n“People are just not used to going to the DMV online,” he said. “People have this idea, this impression that to be able to do their business at DMV, they have to get in line.” \n \nEarlier this week, state officials announced seven workers who recently received layoff notices at the Department of Labor will fill open jobs at the DMV and help to reduce the backlog. Ayala said the Office of Policy and Management has agreed to unfreeze 16 positions at the branches, which he said will be filled immediately to help with the backlogs. \n \nAyala urged customers who’ve been waiting to renew their licenses or IDs to now visit a AAA office or use the DMV’s website, at http://www.ct.gov/dmv , and not risk missing the upcoming Oct. 10 deadline.
0653_36595a95-548d-4462-98bc-dee7373b3461	A simple and creamy Thai spiced red lentil soup that cooks in 30 minutes and is both vegan and gluten free. A light dinner or perfect lunch.  \n \n\n \nYup I am full aware summer is in full swing and I’m sharing a steamy hot creamy soup recipe. \n \nDid I make this last winter and forget to share it until now? Nope. \n \nI made this for lunch today and while the soup has 5 servings I quickly gobbled up 3 of those. \n \nSometimes you just need soup in your life, regardless of weather, season or outside temperature. \n \nToday is that day for me. I woke up with a slight lingering sore throat and knew what I had to do. Starting with a glass of warm lemon water and gurgling with salt and ending with this soup I am already feeling better. \n \nI actually made soup last night too – my classic Asian noodle soup , which also quickly disappeared. It’s definitely been soup time around here. Soup and nap time. I’ve been super lethargic the last couple days. \n \nI’m not usually a napper — mostly because pre nap I’m sleep and post nap I’m groggy, sleepy and cranky so it always seems to me as if I was better off just being sleeping before the nap. \n \nBut today and yesterday I’ve been in nap mode as well. Sometime it truly is great to take a nice long afternoon couch nap. And then to wake up to soup soup soup. \n \nYes please. It may be time for another nap, and another bowl of soup right after. \n \nThis soup cooks in 30 minutes and is packed full of Thai flavors. Not exactly a traditional soup – mostly my take on what a Thai version of red lentil soup would be. With red curry paste, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, shallots, lime juice, cilantro and coconut cream you should already know this soup is awesome. \n \nI love tender and smooth red lentils which cook much quickly than other lentils and to me are more flavorful. If you don’t have the Thai style ingredients on hand you could always make my traditional red lentil soup instead, or my apple red lentil soup ! \n  Thai Red Lentil Soup {Gluten-Free, Vegan}        Save  Print      Prep time   10 mins     Cook time   20 mins     Total time   30 mins        A simple and creamy Thai spiced red lentil soup that cooks in 30 minutes and is both vegan and gluten free.

Universal suffrage is one of the great gifts of our constitution and the elections are our opportunity for making a choice; if we do not make a correct choice then we would have to suffer the consequences of the ineptness of our choice. So we must choose wisely! We have been fed on this diet  for so long that I have come to believe that this bit of wisdom has welled up from within me ;  it  is immanent , self evident  and  without the need of proof. But I am wondering whether voting is a privilege or a punishment? My diffidence stems from a variety of reasons. To start with the high power but subtle canvassing by the media, by way of surveys and opinion polls, have already narrowed the choice of acceptable alternatives to the two major political alliances.The oracular wisdom is that the third front is a mishmash coalition of non serious contenders, which in some situations will act like red herrings.   This time round the daggers are out in the open.  Votes are being boldly solicited, even by reasonable men, in the name of caste or religion. According to the current ethic members of the same caste must share the same electoral preference. I belong to a marginal constituency of voters; my caste men are thinly spread all over the state, not concentrated in any place to make us count. My individual vote is of no consequence.  Where does that leave people like us? May be the Election Commission will designate a separate category for sundries. Or would it transfer my name to a constituency where one of my caste man is seeking election?  The fact that I am thoroughly confused as to the character and worth of the leadership of the two competing groups is another cause for my reluctance.  Like it happens in a wife swapping community each one of our leaders has slept with the other. At one time or the other they have been allies and have now split.  Only the other day the current alliance partners had draped each other in a set of threadbare attributions;  calling each other thugs, frauds, backstabbers, communal and now they are recommending each other as leaders full of political virtue who would take Bihar out of the valley of tears. Reminded of their earlier opinions equally copious volume of contradictions, refutations rebuttals, and revision of opinions are offered. Were they lying yesterday or are they being truthful today? What irreconcilable difference kept them implacably hostile for decades and if they have come together what was the factor for this moistening of the soul? Sheer opportunism kept them glued together and vaulting ambition made them part company. The voters of Bihar were not even distantly on their agenda. Given their long history of association, betrayal, homecoming there is no reason to trust them now . I am not sure that those whom I choose will not end up on the other side.  There are other  weightier reasons : even though they offer themselves as alternatives to each other both the alliances hew in to the same logic of power; even though they claim to be as different from each other  their agenda  seem to be informed of the same concerns. We look for political manifestos that chart routes to a better and more prosperous future but both the alliances are by habit preoccupied with the past.  They both present a vision of an alternative social order; a social order in which full reparation has been made for the iniquities and injustices suffered in historical times. In the popular debate it has been termed as Mandal Vs Kamandal.   For the Grand Alliance reservation of jobs in government services- with plans to extend it to private enterprise- by the affirmative action of reservation is the essence of social justice. Since the reservation is an open ended scheme with no time frame or cap, there are fears in some quarters that in the end it will put in place another system of privileges and exclusion .Unborn generations of certain social groups come to this world in debt to the disadvantaged groups; they must pay for the putative sins of their ancestors. In the new jurisprudence one can be punished not for what you have done but for who you are. This poses huge difficulties for the system: because there must be an affective nexus between guilt and punishment. But under the pressure of the majority the system is forced to violate its own rule; when reminded of the premise or the promise of the constitution it refuses to enter into a debate. The much reviled pre- modern Manuvadi system can now be achieved by parliamentary and democratic processes. Hardik Patel’s agitation for wholly unfeasible demands which are impossible to meet flows from the irrefutable logic that those with sufficient numbers and political clout can get reservation. The complexity of the politics of reservation must be evident to all but immediate gains are what matters; the devil can take the hindmost. The Kamandal brigade claims to be both the self appointed guardian of the interest of all the Hindus as well as the custodian of their racial memory. It cites the same rationale of the reconciliation of a large generalized grievance of victimisation in historical times at the hands of the foreign Muslim invaders. Their task is equally open ended, loosely defined and amorphous but there is no doubt that the aims are reactionary, retrograde, and revanchist. Political theologian of social justice and philosophers of Hinduttva when in power   apply the same criteria   for determining “who does and who does not belong to a given civic community.”  Facts of biology become the determinant for entitlement. We have not yet forgotten the militaristic  slogan BHURA BAL SAF KARO (Bhu – Bhumihar, Ra- Rajput, Ba- Brahmin, L- Lala, and Kayasth)-  which  emerged as an agendum  in  an earlier regime  and was voiced quite openly in speeches and street rallies . A crazy idea that police should withdraw to let the Hindus wreak their vengeance was allegedly articulated and practiced in Gujarat. I am sure it must have equally shaken those at the receiving end of it. Both the BHURA BAL and Gujarat   have become part of our sense of time and place. Diasagreement should not invite peril in a democracy. Fear is the characteristic of totalitarian regimes.  So whichever way I vote it will be for an essentially pre modern, sectarian regime capable of inducing fear of persecution and discrimination in a sizeable section of my fellow citizens.  Whoever comes  will be fighting yesterday’s wars today  and our todays’ will have become yesterdays for nothing.   The reasons for disenchantment are many more. The electoral arena is crowded with the heirs of political dynasties who bring nothing to the table except that they are the sons of their fathers. Exempt from the compulsion of earning a living, they roll in unbelievable luxury and bide their time to stake claims for   a slice of the cake of political power. Chances are that many of them will be elected, and we would have helped the creation of a new aristocracy, a new feudal class. Again the irony of the situation is that the new feudalism will draw its sustenance from the democratic processes that we cherish so much and the results are achieved with remarkable economy of effort. There are no violent upheavals; the electoral mechanism, the jewel in the crown of parliamentary state form is retained and the facade of our precious democratic form is maintained in all particulars. It is our version of the “velvet revolution” with retrograde and reactionary aims.     Power is tested on the touchstone of legitimacy and in a democracy it is the electoral fray where the claims of legitimacy are interrogated, denied or granted. The midas touch of the  people’s mandate has become the ultimate test of political virtue. Every election ritually consecrates history sheeters of yore, murderers, kidnappers, thugs, extortionists as our leaders. This election is no different. No wonder political discourse is conducted in the lingo of  street brawls- maa ka dodh piya hai , chati phad denge etc. In fact one our venerable  leaders openly threatened a serving CM on prime time TV.  What could be more tragic,  farcical or absurd that the fight within the terrain of national politics is now confined to a  ridiculously tiny amount of jobs that are available with the government, or renaming of roads and alleys? Meanwhile in Bihar   development issues are left to the ingenuity of the statistics department and captive intellectuals of government funded think tanks who tote up figures indicating a meteoric rise of the state  in every sphere but  urgent problems of poverty, insanitation,  education, health care, and the catastrophic erosion of democratic infrastructure stare us in  the face every day. On my table diary 28th October the d – day, the date for polling in Patna is marked in admonitory red but with every passing day I feel less and less sure of my ability to choose rightly. .

0657_7496cbe3-06f0-4fb9-a86f-1aea541caef9	“ Trevor, what advice would you give to someone trying to build up their photography business? ” That’s a question I hear about once a month. As I have reflected back over the last six years after I went full-time as a photographer, I have often wondered what was the best move I’ve ever made to build up my business. Here’s my answer to that question. \n \n\n \nBack in 2012, as I was doing my daily dose of studying the news and techniques that were being taught in various photography related blogs, I saw a post that caught my eye. It was on the Fstoppers ‘ website, and it was a request for applications for new content writers. I put together a list of accomplishments and excitedly sent off my request to join the team. I got to eat my big slice of humble pie the next day when I got an email back letting me know they picked others instead. About 6-months later, they put out another request for writers; once again I gave it a shot and let them know I’d be interested. It took five days, but I finally heard back that I landed the position. I was beyond excited! \n \nFrom that day forward, I started writing articles at Fstoppers, usually 2-3 a week. After a few years, I switched from Fstoppers to SLR Lounge. These last three years of producing content for photographers have been incredible for my business and brand. Participating as a writer on these blogs have been the best thing I have done to help grow my business. Here are seven reasons why, followed by my tips on getting involved. \n 1. I Became a More Skilled Photographer  \nBecause I would constantly be thinking about what I should write that week, I would always be looking for ways to improve my skills as a photographer. I became more acquainted with my camera, learned the software I used inside and out, and always kept up with the latest info in the industry. \n \n\n 2. My Clients Saw Me As An Educator in the Industry  \nWhen your clients begin to view you as an educator in your field, they immediately think of you as an expert in your craft. It makes you a much more enviable, and dare I say, desirable. \n 3. Other Doors Begin to Open Where You Didn’t Even Know a Door Existed.  \nAfter writing content for these top photography blogs, I started getting invitations to speak and teach at different photo events. In fact, I just got home from speaking at Wedding MBA this week in Las Vegas and have had the opportunity to speak at the incredible WPPI convention in 2014 and 2015. \n 4. I Got Some Fantastic Link Backs To My Website That Are Wonderful for SEO.  \nNow if someone were to search out photographers in Arizona, I wouldn’t be near the top, only because I haven’t given any thought to SEO over the years and didn’t strive for Google referrals. But I’m about to change all that as I examine the new possibility of opening an associate side of my business for 2016. Once I dial in my SEO, I will be able to reap the rewards of all the previous articles I have written that link back to my website with keywords such as, “ wedding photographer in Arizona .” \n \nIt’s not hard to slip those kinds of links into an article you are writing. For example, “ As one of the top wedding photographers in Arizona , I have found that the Canon 70-200 lens is an instrumental piece of gear. ” These links are extremely important in Google’s rankings and help to validate your personal website as one that is important and should be towards the top of their ratings. \n \n\n 5. I’ve Been Able to Sell-out Photo Workshops I Teach On the Side.  \nBecause of the articles I have written, I have been able to build a base of followers that are interested in learning about new workshops I announce. As a result, it’s been easy for me to sell-out workshops. I don’t take my role as a workshop instructor lightly though. I take advantage of the two days I have with my students to teach as much as I possibly can. Here at SLR Lounge, we are developing ways in the future for our writers to share even more about their workshops as we believe we have some of the most caring and qualified instructors writing on staff. We are excited to be able to use those benefits in the future to reach out to even more people. \n \nI am going to tread lightly with this next reason because it doesn’t happen often. \n 6. Occasionally Writing for These Blogs Gets You Some Awesome Free Stuff.  \nIt might be some software you review, maybe a cool new Kickstarter that you talk about or just a low-priced piece of gear. Sometimes, it makes more sense to the company that you keep it than ship it back to them. That doesn’t mean we get to keep cameras or lenses. That would be nice, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. After having some time with the blog, it is fun to be called on to test new cameras or try out a brand new to market lenses. Just keep in mind those jobs usually go to those that have been around for awhile. \n \n\n 7. Lunch Money  \nWriting for these blogs does not mean we can hang up our cameras and retire as a photographer. But, we do make a few extra dollars that will cover a nice lunch for a friend and I at Chipotle. One time another photographer alluded to how much money the writers of these blogs must make to put the content together. I chuckled. The job is not about the money. In fact, blogs, in general, don’t make a huge sum of money from advertisements. Essentially enough to cover expenses. \n \nUsually where they can see a profit is from the sale of additional products on the site such as Lightroom Presets or video tutorials such as the Lighting 201 video that was just released here on the site. Having articles on the site is to drive viewers there so they can be introduced to the new products available and see if it’s a good fit for their business. If you think you’ll make big moola writing for a photography blog, you might be a bit disappointed. That said, my exposure on the blog has driven lots of paying business to me. \n \nIf you are interested in getting involved as a writer and boosting your photography business and brand. Here are a few tips to consider. \n  Don’t be afraid to ask. When I asked Fstoppers back in 2012, I was still in my “teen stages” as a photographer. I didn’t understand everything and constantly compared my work to others much better than me. Heck, I still do. We all do. Don’t let that deter you from getting involved.  Understand that some of the best articles are the most basic ones. While you might think everything has already been written about before often the most basic of articles are the ones with the most viewership. There are thousands of new people picking up cameras every day. They are all discovering these blogs to help them learn. A simple article talking about focus, exposure or white balance can be a huge resource for those wanting to learn.  Realize that the first few articles will take hours to put together. But once you get the hang of it, you won’t be investing as much time. Just like any system, once you get it down, things flow a lot easier.  Consistency is key. If you want to build up your business by being a content marketer, you have to be consistent. Writing an article once every few months won’t generate the buzz you need. Schedule yourself a time each week to put something together. Pick a day or two and stick with it.  Ideas will come to you throughout the week. Have a place to jot them down. I have an Evernote set up where I write down ideas that come to mind. That way I can pull from that resource whenever needed to put something together. One of the best resources for ideas is in photography Facebook groups. Often you’ll see questions from others in those groups that can become fantastic articles.  Write one or two articles now as practice. You can then send those articles as a demo of your work to your favorite photography blog. Let them know you’d be interested in working with them. For the majority of us, our career is photography so don’t worry if you didn’t major in English in college.  If you despise writing and would rather create videos, there is a lot of opportunity for that as well. Again, reach out to your favorite blog and let them know you would like to share a video each week.   [REWIND:  5 TIPS TO GETTING YOUR WORK FEATURED IN AN ONLINE PUBLICATION (LIKE SLR LOUNGE!) ]  \nTo wrap this up my last piece of advice is to pick a blog that you respect and that has a good reputation in the industry. I decided to switch over to SLR Lounge about six months ago because of the amazing guys that run the operation. Not only do they run a fantastic and incredibly instructional blog, but they also run one of the California’s largest and most reputable wedding studios. These guys are in the trenches with all of us shooting 3-4 times a week, often doing double-header weddings during the busy season. Their hard work was an example to me and made me want to work side by side next to such great guys. Not only that but they built a team of truly talented people around them. Then to top it all off they sincerely care about helping the industry. \n \nI’ve learned so much from all their tutorials and articles and just love the enthusiasm they have to help make our industry the best it can be. In conclusion, if you are sitting on the sidelines reading this and have an inkling to start writing yourself. JUMP! It was the best decision I ever made for my business, and I am confident it will be for yours as well. \n \n\n \nI hope some of you reading this article take action and seek out opportunities become a content producer for your favorite photography blog. If you are interested in seeking out an opportunity at SLR Lounge, here’s the inside info. Send a writing sample or link to an article you have on your own blog to our Managing Editor, Hanssie at Hanssie@slrlounge.com. \n \nIn closing, if you want to become a better business, you need to be taking action. I took action back in 2012, and it was the best move I ever made for my business and career. I’ve learned so much over the last 3 years, I’ve made friends outside of my genre of photography, I’ve earned business because of my position as an educator in the industry and most of all, I have had the most amazing experience throughout it all.
0658_39c0cd61-2a85-49df-9901-e9438494892c	Company News: Page (1) of 1 - 09/08/15  print page (September 08, 2015) DMN Newswire--2015-9-8-- \n\nESPM, one of Brazil's premiere institutes of higher learning has inaugurated a cutting edge Broadcast Teaching Center for its São Paulo Journalism Campus. Positioned as an elliptical, six-station teaching island, the 45 sq. m / 480 sq. ft. classroom/production center provides students with full visual access to all production/ broadcast activity. The classroom enables students to immerse themselves in the hyper-realistic broadcast environment, both as working participants and as observers. 'This project was initiated in 2011 by Gabriel Nyari, ESPM's A/V Technical Supervisor at the time," reports WSDG-Walters-Storyk Design Group, Brazil Partner/GM Renato Cipriano. "Nyari worked closely with WSDG Project Manager, Breno Magalhães and I throughout the 2+-year design and construction process. Our mandate was to develop a comprehensive master plan including production and broadcast studios, office spaces and meeting/conference rooms. And, to design and fine-tune the studio's acoustics," Cipriano says. "Because it is situated above and below active classrooms, we stipulated complete room-within-room studio construction. This floating system enabled us to isolate all sound emanating from the studio and exclude external sound from encroaching on student productions and broadcasts." Extensive pre-planning sessions with Nyari and ESPM, São Paulo, General Director of Graduation, Luiz Fernando D. Garcia, inspired Cipriano to recommend an oval configuration for the glass enclosed production/teaching suite. "Nyari and Garcia were determined to make this studio a showplace that would inspire and motivate students," WSDG PM Breno Magalhães explains. The elliptical shape literally places it at the hub of the floor. Two expansive studio windows flood the area with daylight, and, they provide every student who passes by with a sense of the activity and excitement generated within. Nine spoke-like ceiling treatments enhance the rooms' acoustic quality and lend additional visual support to the wheel-like, design concept," Magalhães adds. \n\n"Our new studio complex was initially envisioned for the Journalism Course, but a number of other ESPM disciplines have also found it extremely useful," says Daniel Gomes, ESPM Technical Supervisor for Sound & Video. "We make every effort to comply with their requests, and also coordinate studio access for extra-curricular and institutional events. This investment has proven itself an invaluable asset," says Gomes, who collaborated with WSDG on the project's final stages, including its full commissioning, and now supervises ESPM Broadcast Journalism Center activities. \n\nLuiz Fernando D. Garcia, who mentored the project, remarked, "WSDG was recommended for this project by a number of construction, equipment sales and installation firms who we contacted during our design search. Those endorsements coupled with examples of WSDG's proficiency on ambitious projects for major universities around the world convinced us of their professionalism. Their design and construction process was extremely satisfactory. Both the faculty and the student body are pleased with our new Broadcast Education Center. We are confident that it will enable ESPM to provide this growing industry with a new generation of highly qualified and enthusiastic creative production personnel." "Education has been a primary WSDG focus for many years," said company Partner/Director of International Relations, Sergio Molho, "We've designed and built major teaching studios for the Berklee College of Music's Valencia and Boston campus's, for NYU's Steinhardt Center, The University of Colorado, Bolder, Javerina University in Bogota, and over two dozen teaching studios for The Art Institutes across the United States. Our co-founder, architect/acoustician John Storyk lectures at colleges around the U.S., and is an adjunct professor at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. Education is in WSDG's DNA, and we are especially proud of our work for ESPM." \n\nWalters-Storyk Design Group-WSDG, has designed over 3500 media facilities worldwide. Credits include Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Studios (1969); NYC's Jazz At Lincoln Center and Le Poisson Rouge; broadcast facilities for The Food Network, ESPN, and WNET; major education complexes for NYU and Berklee College of Music, Boston (2015 TEC winner) and Valencia, Spain; and media rooms for such corporate clients as Hoffman La Roche. Recent projects include NYC's Jungle City Studios and private studios for Green Day, Jay-Z, Timbaland's Tim Mosley, film composers Carter Burwell and A.R. Rahman, Aerosmith, Bruce Springsteen and Alicia Keys. WSDG principals John Storyk), Beth Walters, Sergio Molho, Renato Cipriano, Dirk Noy and Silvia Molho lecture frequently at universities and industry events, and contribute regularly to industry publications. WSDG has collaborated with such noted architects as Frank Gehry, Rafael Vinoly, Norman Foster, Oscar Niemeyer, Phillipe Stark and Nicholas Grimshaw.

0661_67116460-5f96-43d0-a970-ee61917e82d0	A LOVESTRUCK Abhinav Singh was unrelenting in the way he stalked his boss's daughter in Gladstone. \n\nThe engineer declared war, determined to get the young woman, swamping her with hundreds of texts, phone calls and voice messages, ignoring warnings from police and her father who told Singh he was frightening his daughter. \n\nInstead, police prosecutor Nina Sulzer told Gladstone Magistrates Court that Singh, 33, professed his love saying: "I have now officially declared a war to get ***** at any cost". \n\nIn chilling words to the young woman's father, Singh said: "In this war I will fight brave battles with whoever comes in my way." \n\nSingh pleaded guilty to stalking the woman between July 14 and August 28 in Gladstone and elsewhere in Queensland. \n\n"I am guilty, I plead guilty," Singh said when he went before magistrate Mark Morrow via a telephone hook-up from a Queensland Detention Centre where he was being held after his arrest by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. \n\nThe Indian-born professional is on a Canadian passport and will be deported, leaving behind his wife who is a doctor in Rockhampton, and their two children. \n\nMs Sulzer said the woman had been his work colleague who never expressed any romantic interest in Singh, instead telling police Singh was in "fantasyland". \n\nShe said Singh went through office records to get her mobile phone number. \n\nIn one text Singh apologised for the 'trauma' and he also admitted following the woman and her boyfriend around the Stockland shops. \n\nWhen Singh went on holiday to India the Gladstone woman kept receiving missed calls and voice messages from international numbers that she tried to block. \n\nShe also discovered Singh had looked through her Facebook profile and in desperation the woman contacted his wife in Rockhampton. \n\n"She (the victim) believes he was living in fantasyland. She was in no way romantically inclined toward him and she sought the assistance of police," Ms Sulzer said. \n\n"He said it was no fantasy but was acting out of his heart." \n\nIn other incidents Singh twice went to the family home and had argued with her father, telling him he officially declared war. \n\nHe had responded to a police email to stop all contact by stating he would continue to pursue her until he got a message from her stating she did not love him. \n\n"I'm in love with *******. It's my right to express my love to her. I will continue to call her," he told police. \n\nDefence lawyer Jun Pepito said Singh was attracted to the woman but mistook her friendliness at work for something more. \n\n"His stupidity of behaviour will cause long-lasting consequences to his wife and children. He was here on a temporary resident's visa. No, they are not filing for divorce at this stage." \n\nMr Pepito said Singh's wife contacted Immigration and he was now waiting to be \n\ndeported. \n\nMr Morrow said Singh's actions had significant consequences for him. He was fined $2000 and ordered not to contact or go near the woman for two years.
0662_542440a6-abfb-4635-8acb-745ab143d334	[caption id="" align="alignright" width="401"] Early Christian Catacomb painting[/caption]\nThere are three creeds that Christians of the past wrote to try to sum up essential Christian beliefs, and draw a line about what is true Christianity and what is not.\n\nWhile these creeds came at a somewhat late point in Christian history (the earliest is from maybe the fourth century, and the latest is from about the sixth) most forms of Christianity since the formations of these creeds have more or less found them good descriptions of wholesome Christian viewpoints and they have served as a litmus test of orthodoxy.   Yet, it appears that in the last few decades, Christianity has no longer found these creeds to be a good barometer of what beliefs a true Christian should or should not have.   But more on that in a moment.  For now, here are the three creeds:\n\n\nThe Nicene Creed\n\n\n\n"I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible.\n\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages, God\nof God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father,\nthrough Whom all things were made: Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, was\nincarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man: Who for us, too, was crucified under\nPontius Pilate, suffered, and was buried: the third day He rose according to the Scriptures, ascended into\nheaven, and is seated on the right hand of the Father: He shall come again with glory to judge the living\nand the dead, and His kingdom shall have no end.\n\nAnd in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceeds from the Father and the Son: Who\ntogether with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified: Who spoke by the prophets.\nAnd I believe one holy, Christian, and apostolic Church.\n\nI acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins, and I look for the resurrection of the dead and life of\nthe age to come.\n\nAmen."\n\n\n\nThe Apostles' Creed\n\n"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth." \n"And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead." \n"I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic Church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen."\n\n\n\nThe Athanasian Creed\n\n"Whoever wishes to be saved must, above all else, hold the true Christian faith. Whoever does not keep it whole and undefiled will without doubt perish for eternity.\nThis is the true Christian faith, that we worship one God in three Persons and three Persons in one God without confusing the Persons or dividing the divine substance. For the Father is one Person, the Son is another, and the Holy Spirit is still another, but there is one Godhead of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, equal in glory and coequal in majesty. What the Father is, that is the Son and that is the Holy Spirit: the Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, the Holy Spirit is uncreated; the Father is unlimited, the Son is unlimited, the Holy Spirit is unlimited; the Father is eternal, the Son is eternal, the Holy Spirit is eternal; and yet They are not three Eternals but one Eternal, just as there are not Three Who are uncreated and Who are unlimited, but there is One who is uncreated and unlimited.\n\nLikewise the Father is almighty, the Son is almighty, the Holy Spirit is almighty.\nSo the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God.\nSo the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, the Holy Spirit is Lord, and yet they are not three Lords but one\nLord.\nFor just as we are compelled by Christian truth to acknowledge each Person by Himself to be God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the Christian religion to say that there are three Gods or three Lords.\nThe Father was neither made nor created nor begotten by anybody.\nThe Son was not made or created, but was begotten by the Father.\nThe Holy Spirit was not made or created or begotten, but proceeds from the Father and the Son.\nAccordingly there is one Father and not three Fathers, one Son and not three Sons, one Holy Spirit and not three Holy Spirits."\n\n\n\n****************\nOk, so, I know there are debates raging about hell and universalism that people might bring up to challenge these creeds, but when I talk about the fact that these creeds no longer seem to describe a good litmus test for Christianity, that's not exactly what I'm thinking about.  Rather, I'm considering this:\n\nIf you want to be given the right hand of fellowship in most churches, it might be ok to question the nature of hell.   That might not get you ostracized from a small group, or turned away from the prayer team, or kept from leading worship.  I guess it depends on the church.   But, brothers and sisters, here is what must be added to the above creeds to properly represent Christianity, and to know who is safe to work together with for the Kingdom.   That is:\n\n1) Everyone must acknowledge that life begins at conception - AND - they must pledge to only vote for pro-life candidates.\n2) Everyone must stand against LGBT "marriage."\n3) Everyone must renounce the very use of the word "feminism" and anything that that word could possibly stand for (and it helps to also be ready to admit that any type of feminism is just a step away from lesbianism, as well as an attack on men.)\n4) Everyone must believe that the first two chapters of Genesis are completely literal, factual history and do not employ any spiritual allegory nor ancient myth in the prose.\n5) Everyone must agree that evolution, or at least "macro" evolution is a lie against God and\n6) Everyone must agree that Obama is the most evil president they have ever seen in their lifetime, and\n7) Everyone must acknowledge that the United States is a Christian nation built on Christian principles and be praying fervently that it will turn back to God.\n\nThese ideas are indeed the real litmus tests of a true believer.   Stay away from anyone who won't wholeheartedly confess to these ideas.  In fact - the three ancient creeds above - you don't even need them.  Just skip right to the sacred seven list here and you'll know who does - and doesn't - belong in your church and outreach team.   THIS my friends is how you can tell who is and isn't a true Christian, and true follower of Jesus Christ.   Get #1 through #7 correct, and you're in.\n\nIt's a jungle out there - or at least, a sinful generation.  So be prepared to test those claiming to be Christians with this list.   That way, you can make sure to surround yourself with good company and not be corrupted by the evil influences that have crept into some churches.   Stand firm for the gospel!  And the faith of these seven things once for all delivered to the saints.\n\nForever and ever.  Amen.

They were both really relieved and thankful when we arrived. They were cold but unharmed. \n \n"If they hadn’t called for help when they did they could have ended up waist deep in water and it would have been more serious. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"A lot of people can get caught out by the tide if they don’t know the area. We would encourage people visiting the beach to speak to the lifeguards about tide times and the sea conditions.’ \n \nLifeguards took the woman back to the beach at Watergate Bay. The volunteer lifeboat crew on board the D Class inshore lifeboat picked the man up and transported him to the B Class Atlantic 85 lifeboat before he was taken into Newquay Harbour. He was then driven back to the beach by a volunteer crew member.

Madhu on Thursday launched a campaign against the State government’s move to acquire 14,500 acres of land from for the Masula villages to be affected by the acquisition of nearly 14,500 acres. \n\nsaid the State government planned to hand over huge extent of private land to be acquired for the Machilipatnam deep sea port and other industries to the private companies. \n\nAccompanied by various left party leaders, Mr. Madhu said that the CPI(M) was engaged in seeking necessary support from the other left parties in the State to protest against the government to stop the acquisition. “A state wide bandh will be called in protest against the proposed land acquisition soon. Since legal options to stop the acquisition process are a very few, intensified protest by the farmers is only way to face it”, Mr. Madhu told The Hindu. He lamented that the concept of Special Economic Zone (SEZ) has been a failed attempt by the government, particularly in the case of SEZs set up in Visakhapatnam and Nellore.“The government is busy in acquiring lakhs of acres of land across the State than the required land for the proposed projects along the coast of AP ”, he opined. He appealed to the farmers and other affected communities to intensify their means of protest against the land survey to be soon taken up by the Krishna district revenue officials as per the land acquisition notification issued in August. A team of CPI(M) leaders led by Mr. Madhu on Thursday campaigned against the land acquisition at China Karagraharam and Pothepalli of Machilipatnam mandal in Krishna district.
0665_1eb24364-3568-4143-8aa1-1f2c3cbd70ba	Kirsten Dunst has picked out a name for their future child. \n\nAnd it seems Garrett Hedlund is on the same wavelength as his girlfriend of three-and-a-half years. \n\nThe actor was spotted unloading baby supplies outside the couple's Los Angeles home on Saturday. \n\nCarting a vintage-style wooden high chair, a Pack-n-Play crib and an umbrella stroller inside, all they need now is a baby. \n   \nBaby on the brain? Garrett Hedlung was spotted unloading baby supplies outside his and Kirsten Dunst's Los Angeles home on Saturday \n   \nEverything but the baby: The actor appeared to be prepping to host friends over the Labour Day weekend \n\nAnd while it appeared Garrett was simply getting the house ready to host friends for the Labour Day Weekend, it surely won't be long until he's prepping for his own child. \n\n'I'm in baby mode because two of my really good friends are pregnant right now,' his long-term love told Red magazine last year. \n\n'One of them is pretty chilled and the other's like, "I can't wait to have a glass of wine!" \n\n'I love it though. We've already picked her girl's name, it's done! I think 33 is a good age to have your first baby.' \n   \nHis turn next: Garrett's long-term love has made no secret of the couple's desire to start a family \n   \nPicked out a name: Kirsten, 33, said she was the right age to start a family \n\nThe blonde beauty, who turned 33 in April, has been dating Garrett since October 2011. \n\nBut before they start a family the couple are said to have one more thing to organise - their wedding. \n\nIndeed just this week Star magazine said that the 32-year-old Tron star had popped the question to his 33-year-old girlfriend. \n\nAn insider insisted the couple threw a party 'for 50 of their closest friends and family at their home in LA' to celebrate the news. \n   \nDashing duo: Garrett and Kirsten, seen here in November, are reported to be engaged \n   \nNot so fast: Though a rep for the actor denied Star's engagement story, an insider confirmed that the couple was 'throwing a party for 50 of their closest friends and family at their home in LA' to celebrate the news; here they are seen in October  \n\nAccording to the source, the Bring It On starlet 'already calls him her husband.' The wedding will take place sometime in 2016, according to the weekly. \n\nHis rep denied the story to the magazine. \n\nIt was also alleged that the two are interested in starting a family down the line. \n\n'They've hinted that they're ready to become parents,' said the pal. \n\n'If all goes according to plan, by this time next year they'll be married and Kirsten will be pregnant!' \n\nIn December UsWeekly also reported the Unbroken star was gearing up to ask Dunst for her hand in marriage. \n   \nWide awake: The two met on the set of On The Road  in 2012; here Dunst is seen in a scene from the film \n\nThe two met on the set of On the Road back in 2012 and have been inseparable ever since. \n\nTheir relationship apparently started out with a rocky first date involving a canoe and a stagnant pond. \n\nGarrett later fondly recalled, 'I took her out on a 3am canoe ride. It was not a stable canoe. We fell out and had to swim back in mucky, sh***y water, like golf-pond water.'  \n   \nCruisin': The 32-year-old Hedlund played two characters in the hit film that also starred Kristen Stewart \n\nDunst is perhaps best known for her role opposite Tobey Maguire in 2002's record-setting blockbuster Spider-Man. \n\nShe dated several leading hunks including Jake Gyllenhaal and Adam Brody before meeting Garrett on the set of On The Road. \n\nHedlund dated Leighton Meester, who he met on the set of the 2010 drama Country Strong, which also starred Gwyneth Paltrow. \n\n 
0666_e63e636c-97e1-4647-872c-697cb4cb52c3	It finally happened —Ruben Amaro Jr. is out as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies . And, at long last, there's a chance for a new direction in the City of Brotherly Love. \n \nWe'll get to that new direction shortly. But first, it's necessary to perform a brief autopsy of the Amaro regime. \n \nThe team announced his firing Thursday, per  Joey Nowak of MLB.com , one day after the Phillies were eliminated from postseason contention. \n \nOf course, in reality, the Phils have been out of contention for months and even years. Yes, they advanced to the World Series in 2009 in Amaro's first season as GM, made it to the National League Championship Series in 2010 and won the NL East in 2011. \n \nSince then, however, Philadelphia has missed the playoffs for four consecutive seasons. This year, it's sunk to a new low with the worst record in baseball. \n \nMuch of the blame for that stretch of futility rests squarely on Amaro's shoulders. \n    Chris Szagola/Associated Press/Associated Press/Associated Press   \nAmaro led the Phillies to a World Series in 2009 but endured four straight fruitless seasons thereafter. \n  \nFirst, there's his noted aversion to analytics in an era when advanced stats and player evaluation have become the norm.  \n \nFor his part, Amaro didn't even have an analytics department until after the 2013 season, when the Phillies added Scott Freedman as a consultant from MLB 's Labor Relations Department. Even then, Amaro sounded skeptical. "I don't know if it's going to change the way we do business," he said at the time, per  MLB.com's Todd Zolecki .  \n \nThat attitude helps explain Amaro's head-scratching tendency to keep aging players past their sell-by date. \n \nTake the infield core of shortstop Jimmy Rollins, second baseman Chase Utley and first baseman Ryan Howard. \n \nYes, they helped the Phillies win a championship in 2008 and contributed to the success of Amaro's early years as GM. \n \nBut Amaro re-signed Rollins to a three-year deal after the 2011 season, agreeing to pay the veteran through his age-35 campaign.  And, much more infamously, he handed a five-year, $125 million extension to Howard in 2010, a full two seasons before the first baseman's existing contract was set to expire. \n \nYes, hindsight is 20/20. But considering how far Howard's stock has fallen in the intervening years, that will go down as one of the more bone-headed baseball  decisions in recent memory. \n    Ralph Freso/Associated Press   \nSigning Ryan Howard to a huge extension might rank as Amaro's biggest blunder. \n  \nThen there was the string of big-money deals and extensions Amaro handed to starters Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee and closer Jonathan Papelbon. \n \nYes, all three contributed, spectacularly so in the cases of Lee and Halladay. But all three ultimately became albatrosses, as Halladay and Lee succumbed to injury and decline and Papelbon curdled into a distracting malcontent . \n \nEven when Amaro engineered deals as the rebuild finally lurched forward, it often seemed like too little, too late. \n \nTo pick one example: We'll never know what the Phillies could have gotten for Utley at the deadline last year, when he made the All-Star team, rather than this season, when he was a recently injured shell of his former self and yielded a couple of interesting but unspectacular prospects from the Los Angeles Dodgers . \n \nBut it would've behooved the Phillies to find out (granted, Utley did have a no-trade clause). \n \nThe same holds for Papelbon and, to a much lesser extent, Cole Hamels, both of whom Amaro shipped out this summer, but whose names popped up in frequent rumors last year as well. \n \nWriting for FoxSports.com, Mitch Goldich summed it up neatly. \n \n" One of the common criticisms levied against Amaro is that he doesn't seem to have a plan," Goldich noted. "I'd argue it might be more hopeless than that. That even if he did have a plan, there's no guarantee he'd have the discipline to stick to it. Even when he knew the right thing to do, he couldn't help himself."   \n    Lynne Sladky/Associated Press   \nCliff Lee had big moments with the Phillies, but his contract wound up an albatross. \n  \nWe could go on recounting blunders, but you get the picture. Amaro is gone, none too soon, and the door is open for something new. \n \nWhat will that be? And whom should the Phils slide into the general manager's chair? \n \nWhoever takes over won't have to worry much about cutting the fat. With the trades (late or not) of Rollins, Papelbon, Utley and Hamels, as well as outfielder Ben Revere, Philadelphia doesn't have many more pieces to move. (Ryan Howard, with his .228 average and $25 million owed next season, isn't going anywhere.) \n \nYou could argue the Phillies would've been better served bringing in a new GM to oversee their trade-deadline machinations, instead of keeping Amaro on board through July and August.  \n \nIn a way, though, this will allow Amaro's successor to hit the ground running. Even if they didn't always net the biggest possible return, the Phillies restocked a farm system that ESPN's Keith Law ranked No. 25 in baseball before the season. \n    Chris Szagola/Associated Press   \nThird baseman Maikel Franco is a key part of Philadelphia's emerging young core. \n  \nIn particular, the trio of prospects acquired in the Hamels deal — right-hander Jake Thompson, outfielder Nick Williams and catcher Jorge Alfaro —should help a once-barren system bear fruit. \n \nAdd third baseman Maikel Franco, right-hander Aaron Nola and closer Ken Giles, plus shortstop J.P. Crawford — the Phils' No. 1 prospect,  according to MLB.com — and you've got an emerging core any executive should be able to build around. \n \nThe new GM will also have money to play with, as CBS Sports' Mike Axisa oted : \n  \nIn fact, the Phillies only have about $65 million in salary on the books next year according to  Cot's Baseball Contracts . This is a club that has run payrolls north of $165 million every season since 2011. The Phillies aren't hurting for money, they've always been a super high payroll team, so they'll have the resources to go out and sign some big free agents this winter. \n  \nThat could include a front-line starter such as David Price or Johnny Cueto, or a bat like outfielder Justin Upton.  \n \nHanding big contracts to veterans, though, was how Amaro dug his grave. That's not to say the Phillies shouldn't go after expensive free agents, but first they need to bring in a GM with the acumen to make the right moves. \n \nAnd, yes, they need someone who embraces analytics as an essential facet of baseball in the year 2015 and doesn't look at them as some newfangled fad. \n \nScott Proefrock, who served as assistant general manager for Amaro's entire tenure, was named acting GM. But he's merely a place holder.  \n \nIn fact, as Matt Breen, Jake Kaplan and Justin Klugh of Philly.com reported, " The new GM will be handpicked by [Andy] MacPhail, who will succeed Pat Gillick as team president after this season." \n\n   What's your take on the Amaro firing?    \nMacPhail will have plenty of names to choose from, but here's an interesting one: J.J. Picollo. \n \nPicollo has been with the Kansas City Royals since 2006, working his way up from director of player development to his current role as assistant GM. At age 44, he's got the relative youth mixed with a player-development background, which can help shepherd a franchise out of the rebuilding darkness. \n \nIn addition to Picollo, Philly.com's Kaplan floated a handful of names, including  34-year-old Los Angeles Angels assistant GM Matt Klentak, 38-year-old St. Louis Cardinals assistant GM  Michael Girsch  and Miami Marlins  director of pro scouting Jeff McAvoy, also 38, who's spent time with the analytically inclined Tampa Bay Rays and Houston Astros . \n \nNo matter what, Philadelphia should target a candidate who combines freshness with meaningful experience and who brings a track record of making sound, evidenced-based decisions, relying more on advanced scouting and numbers and less on gut. \n \nSomeone, in other words, who has a plan. \n \nAnd so we're back to taking shots at Amaro. Really, though, this is a moment to celebrate for Phillies fans. After years of frustration and futility, a new era is about to arrive. \n \nWhether it'll be successful, and how quickly, remains to be seen. But already, there's something brewing in southeastern Pennsylvania—a feeling folks there haven't had in a while: hope. \n \nAll statistics current as of Sept. 10 and courtesy of MLB.com unless otherwise noted.

To all our family, friends and fans, thank you sincerely for the support." \n \nThe blonde beauty also posted a smiling snapshot with her estranged husband, 40. \n \nThe former couple, who got married in the South of France in July 2013, first sparked rumours they were on the verge of splitting last September after Chad skipped Avril's 30th birthday party in Las Vegas. \n \nAn insider claimed at the time: "It's over. He has been going around LA telling people that they are divorcing." \n \nBut Chad later claimed he was relieved when Avril, who split from Sum 41 rocker Deryck Whibley in 2010 after four years of marriage, finally confirmed she was secretly battling Lyme disease following months of speculation about their marriage. \n \nSpeaking in April, he said: "I'm like, 'OK, the wife has come out and said this, and now I don't have to keep hiding.' \n \n"With everyone going 'What's wrong with your wife? What's wrong with your wife?' and me just going, 'Ah, she's gonna be fine.' \n \n"I'm like 'OK, I can talk about this now.' \n \n"Things are looking up and definitely getting better."

0671_02c3742b-73cd-4fd9-b774-b4c03b23820a	Even if the public are uninterested in Jeremy Corbyn’s attitude towards “the media”, then journalists certainly are. Over the past couple of days I’ve noticed several queries on Twitter about the new Labour leader’s likely media policy. There was a clear indication that he does not plan to follow the established rules of engagement with the mainstream media on Sunday morning, when he declined an invitation to appear on the Andrew Marr Show – his new deputy, Tom Watson, stepped in. Related: Tom Watson urges Corbyn to hold Labour debate on Trident and Nato Instead, Corbyn attended the Camden and Islington NHS Mental Health Trust fun day in central London, giving a speech to a small crowd in what he described as a his “first official engagement” since becoming party leader. — Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) September 13, 2015 Attended & spoke at Camden & Islington NHS Mental Health Trust's Fun Day -important annual community engagement event pic.twitter.com/sZO81K6yGT In many ways, it is as one would expect of a man who has had anything but a good press throughout his parliamentary career. He doesn’t much care for newspapers.\nWhy should he? Like all leftwingers, especially those prepared to stand up for unpopular causes, Corbyn has suffered from a mixture of marginalisation and demonisation. Being marginalised – meaning ignored – has also meant that his TV appearances have been few and far between. Again, that has hardly endeared him to mainstream broadcasters. So his single statement about the media during his leadership campaign, made to the Financial Times, amounted to just three sentences: I think there is far too much concentration in the hands of too few and so I would look at that again. Diversity in media is something that is intrinsic to a democratic society. We do not want the whole media owned by one person. This was interpreted, possibly correctly, as an intention to tackle Rupert Murdoch’s concentration of media ownership. But, of course, Corbyn will need to win the next general election to turn an intention into action. On his website there is a piece, written just before the London mayoral election in 2008, in which Corbyn argued that “the role of the print media needs to be seriously challenged”. He was particularly concerned about what he detected as pro-Boris Johnson and anti-Ken Livingstone coverage of the contest in the London Evening Standard. Corbyn wrote: “While there’s nothing wrong with the forensic examination of any candidate’s policies or record, there is something deeply disturbing about the way in which the media have obsessed themselves with Livingstone, while the shallow banality of Johnson’s rather flimsy policy pronouncements remain unchallenged.” It might be expected of a man of the left that he sees some virtues at the very least in Britain’s public service broadcaster. But he will not have been overly impressed with last Monday’s BBC Panorama, which his supporters regarded as something of a hatchet job. Several described it as an establishment smear and Corbyn’s team argued that it was factually inaccurate and complained to the BBC to demand an apology. It is unclear whether that programme was the reason for Corbyn pulling out of a planned appearance on Sunday’s Andrew Marr Show. Nor will Corbynites have been amused by the piece to camera in the BBC news bulletins on Saturday by its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. She suggested Labour had not learned lessons from its past.\nWhat are we therefore to make of Corbyn’s future relationship with the media? Most newspapers will continue to deride him and will continue digging deep into the archives to discover material about him they regard as embarrassing. One paper he can look to for support is the Morning Star, the daily that takes its editorial line from the Communist Party of Britain. The paper, believed to have a circulation between 10,000 to 20,000, published a rare Sunday edition celebrating his election win – “Jeremy Storms to Victory” – and editor Ben Chacko joined Marr on BBC1 for his paper review. — Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) September 12, 2015 Victory Sunday Special edition of Morning Star: Jeremy storms to victory #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/fckASQzVLA Perhaps the Daily Mirror, having supported Andy Burnham, will build bridges. The Guardian and the Independent are likely to offer impartial coverage. But Corbyn will not be cosying up to the Sun, à la Tony Blair. He will not make the mistake of posing with a copy of the paper, as Ed Miliband did. And he will not cooperate with the Daily Mail. Rightwing papers will treat him as they did Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock. And he probably accepts that there is nothing to be done on that front. But will he dare to advance a media policy based around ownership redistribution? Will it include a demand that Murdoch’s UK company divests itself of certain titles? Despite his new deputy, Watson, not sharing his politics, he will find that they hold very similar views about the press. In a speech in December last year, Watson – a supporter of the Hacked Off campaign – accused the press of operating “like a mafia, intimidating here, bribing there, terminating careers when it suits them and rewarding their most loyal toadies.” He also scorned the regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, set up by publishers. Corbyn and Watson are going to have a torrid time. That may enhance their standing within the Labour movement, but the relentless drip-drip-drip of negativity in the mainstream press will surely have an effect on the uncommitted centre ground. At least, in Scotland, Corbyn has one strong press supporter, the Daily Record. Conceivably, that could win back Labour votes from the SNP.

A woman walked into the backyard of her southern Sydney home and discovered her husband's body covered in blood, according to her triple-zero call.\n\nPolice arrived at the couple's home about 7pm on Monday and found injuries to the 54-year-old man's upper body.\n\nOn Tuesday, police said they wouldn't elaborate on how extensive those injuries were or whether a weapon was involved.\n\nThe couple's home is now a crime scene, and detectives are treating the man's death as suspicious.\n\nWilliam Ryan, a long-term resident of Burrinjuck Place, in the southern suburb of Miranda, said he had been a neighbour to the couple for about 20 years.\n\n"It was quite a shock," he said. "A very sad affair, that's for sure."\n\nHe had last seen the dead man, who he knew only as "Paul", as recently as the weekend.\n\n"He was a quiet guy, a nice guy. [There were] never any dramas."\n\nMr Ryan said had been home from 4pm on Monday, reflecting on the quiet street as he mowed his front lawn until dusk.\n\nIt wasn't until late on Monday night, just shy of midnight, when police knocked on his door that he learned of the tragedy that had occurred. Several hours later, Mr Ryan woke to the sound of a tow-truck removing a car, which he thought belonged to the couple, from the street.\n\nMr Ryan said the street was a small cul-de-sac of just eight homes and anything out of the ordinary wouldn't go unnoticed, he said.\n\nHe said the street had been especially still on Monday afternoon.\n\n"It's one of those sort of streets that if another car comes out, you'd remember it," he said.\n\nIn the two decades he has lived on Burrinjuck Place, Mr Ryan said he had never been burgled.\n\n"I'd be very surprised if it was a robbery. I've never had anything happen that would make me be more conscious of security," he said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0673_72d5fb1e-757c-4c9d-907c-4ca8c9508d6d	LAKEPORT -- The air is so fresh here -- long ranked the cleanest in the nation -- that residents of Lake County like to boast that they don't need to smog test their cars. \n\nBut six wildfires so far this summer have ravaged this rural county north of Napa, and the smoky haze has settled into the souls of its 63,000 residents. Since last weekend, the drought-fueled Valley Fire alone has destroyed nearly 600 homes and killed three people. The blaze still isn't contained and fire season isn't over. It's tough on a county that, unlike its wealthier Wine Country neighbors to the south, is as poor as it is pretty. \n\n"You get the feeling of 'what's next and why?' " said the Rev. Randy Brehms of Lakeport Seventh-day Adventist Church, which has become one of several tent cities for evacuees. "It's overwhelming." \n\nSeth Cantu, facility coordinator at the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Lakeport, Calif., shows one of several areas filled with clothes donated for evacuees on Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015. The church is one of the evacuation centers for displaced residents of the Valley Fire and homeless, too. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group)\n (\nRAY CHAVEZ\n) \n\nIn many ways, locals are content to live one valley over from the center of California's most famous wine region. You can buy a cheaper house or a farm in Lake County and still enjoy the bucolic, oak-studded views. You can raise chickens in town and ride horses down Main Street. \n\nUnlike Napa to the south, luxury hotels never found their way here. The Super 8 and Best Western are the only chain motels in the county. But to the lament of locals, the once-proud Konocti Harbor music venue in Kelseyville, founded by the president of a plumbers union in 1959 to offer affordable vacation rentals for union members, closed six years ago. \n\n\nUntil the fire destroyed it, you could dip naked at Harbin Hot Springs Retreat. Characters are embraced here. And when the Valley Fire hurtled down the center of Middletown and through subdivisions on Cobb Mountain and in Hidden Valley, neighbors rescued neighbors. \n\nMany who grew up in the Bay Area remember spending summers in funky lakeside resorts just north of the fire zone at Clear Lake (which isn't so clear these days). But key indicators of health and wealth show Lake County often falling in the bottom five among California's 58 counties. \n\nBesides the county government based in Lakeport, Walmart and Kmart are the top employers. Senior citizens here are among the poorest in the state. One of every four residents smokes, causing a ripple effect of chronic heart and lung conditions. One in five residents is considered obese. Lake County has one of the highest rates of suicide in the state. Drug abuse is rampant. \n\nThat's part of the reason it will be so tough to recover. \n\nBut they're trying. \n\n"Most of the time, when people talk about our dire circumstances, that doesn't land well with the people who live here. People don't understand there's a strong community effort to try to work together," said Susan Jen, part of the leadership team for Wellville, a nonprofit that chose Lake County as one of five communities across the country to improve residents' health and the economy. \n\nWelcome to Cobb Mount sign was destroyed by the Valley Fire in Middletown, Calif., on Friday, Sept. 18, 2015. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group)\n (\nRAY CHAVEZ\n) \n\n"We'll have to address the real needs that are obviously in front of us, but on the other side, there is the true spirit of looking at not only rebuilding what was, but making something better." \n\nChurches and schools and fairgrounds are running well-stocked evacuation centers. Ranchers are loading their trucks and trailers with hay and feed to deliver to livestock left alone, while many residents remained banned from returning home. A bridal shop donated a dress to a bride who lost everything. \n\nThe "Hardester boys," as they're known in town -- brothers who run Hardester's Market and Hardware stores in Middletown and Cobb -- are showing up at the evacuation centers to check on their customers and deliver paychecks to employees who haven't been able to get to work in a week. \n\nA pedestrian walks along Main Street in downtown Lakeport, Calif., on Friday morning, Sept. 18, 2015. The KPFZ 88.1 FM radio station is located in the white building where they have been keeping updates with the valley Fire since Saturday. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group)\n (\nRAY CHAVEZ\n) \n\nAnd as much as Facebook has been a fire forum for residents, it is a local community radio station -- KPFZ -- in the old Farmers Savings Bank building on Main Street in Lakeport, that people are turning to for information. The 300-watt station at 88.1 FM, staffed by volunteers, suspended its regular programming -- from "Karma Cola" to "Senior Moments" -- to connect those with needs to those who can fill them. \n\n"Hi, this is Rick from Seventh-day Adventist on Park Avenue," said the caller from one of the evacuation centers in Lakeport last week. "We could use kitchen workers -- for the last four days, they've been working their tails off. The other thing that came up was luncheon meats, turkey or chicken -- and belts. We have many pants but few belts. Is it OK that I ask?" \n\nCamping tents are set up for evacuees outside the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Lakeport, Calif., on Friday morning, Sept. 18, 2015. The church is one of the evacuation centers for displaced residents of the Valley Fire and homeless, too. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group)\n (\nRAY CHAVEZ\n) \n\n"That's why we're here," said Andy Weiss, who on a normal day hosts "Pagan World Views" but was fiddling with the sound board one morning last week to answer the on-air call-in line instead. \n\nAs big as the county is -- bordered by Napa County to the south and Mendocino County to the north; at 1,329 square miles, larger than Rhode Island -- people seem to know each other far and wide. \n\n"You can't go anywhere in this county and not meet somebody you know," said Horace Mendoza, 76, who moved from Alameda to Lakeport when he retired. He spends most mornings and evenings catching up with friends at Renee's Cafe in downtown Lakeport, often talking about the lake's premier bass fishing. "We have The Grange and the Lions Club and they visit each other. It's just a big family, really." \n\nThe evacuees are counting on that closeness now more than ever. \n\nAnthony Bracisco, 26, lost not only his own home but also his mother's up on Cobb Mountain, where the fire first hit last Saturday. The only thing that survived -- thanks to a small group of firefighters -- is his garage, filled with the work tools that belonged to his father, who died four years ago. \n\n"Someone tried to break in last night, so I'm going to stay here and protect what little we have left," said Bracisco, a county correctional officer who helped fight the fire and direct traffic during the blaze. "I have 30 days of provisions." \n\nThe county has suffered greatly, he said, with the fires this summer and its pervasive social problems. Since July 29, six fires have torched more than 169,000 acres in Lake and its neighboring counties. The 69,438-acre Rocky Fire destroyed 43 homes. \n\nIt all makes it hard to stay positive, Bracisco said. \n\n"The only thing next for Lake County is for us to stay together and rebuild," he said. "We've seen a lot of terrible things this year, but we will get through this." \n\nAnd someday soon, everyone hopes, the smoke will clear. \n\nContact Julia Prodis Sulek at 408-278-3409.

That occasion is the Porsche Rennsport Reunion V, and the date is September 25-27.\nThe first Porsche Rennsport Reunion was held in 2001 at Lime Rock, Connecticut. In 2004 the event moved to the Daytona Motor Speedway, where it repeated in 2007. The last Porsche Rennsport Reunion took place in 2011 at the Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca , where it will be again in a few weeks.\nIn German, “Rennsport” means motor sports . That is what this event is all about, specifically Porsche motorsports. Hosted by Porsche Cars North America, the Rennsport is billed as the world’s largest gathering of Porsche racing cars , noteworthy drivers, and Porsche collector cars. Porsche’s long history of producing finely engineered automobiles and winning race cars will be on display at the Rennsport V.\nContinue reading for the full story.\ncontinue reading Racing is clearly in Porsche’s DNA. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race more than any other manufacturer. Its first title there came in 1970. It won again this past June, 45 years after its first win at Le Mans .\nPorsche 917 long tail\nPorsche also won the Can-Am (Canadian-American) competition in 1972 and 1973. The Can-Am series regulations on race-car construction and power were basically unlimited. I call these racing machines muscle cars on steroids. Porsche‘s entry was the 917/30, a variation of the Le Mans winner. At 1,580 bhp it generated more power than any other sports car that ever raced. Porsche built a 16-cylinder end-all machine, but the twin-turbocharged 917/30 generated similar power, and did not require the special chassis that the 16-cylinder did. Both were on display at the last Rennsport in 2011.\nPorsche 16-cylinder engine\nFor Porsche aficionados, or just admirers of finely engineered automotive racing machinery, the Porsche Rennsport Reunion is the place to be. Porsche fans will certainly find their favorite models on display, whether street cars or purpose built for the track. Most will probably see models they have never heard of before. Only the exceptionally well versed Porsche fan may be able to identify every model at the event.\n2008 Porsche RS Spyder Chassis 9R6 802, Sebring 2008 overall winner, Dumas, Berhard, CollardSome top racing drivers are scheduled to attend Rennsport V:\nHurley Haywood - Three-time winner at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2002.\nThe first day of the event, Friday, will be devoted mainly to practice. Saturday will have qualifying in the morning with some racing in the afternoon. To finish the day, an exhibition parade of Porsche’s racing history will take place, followed by a concourse on Pit Lane. Sunday will start with a couple hours of warm up lapping followed by racing. At the present time the groups of Porsches scheduled to race are as follows:\nGroup 1: PCA Sholar-Friedman Cup: Porsche Club of America race cars\nGroup 2: Gmund Cup: 550 , 550A, RSK, RS60-61 (4&8 cyl.) 2000 GSGT (Dreikantschaber), Abarth Carrera, 356 , 904-4cam, Porsche specials\nGroup 3: Eifel Trophy: 911 (911 up to 2.5 liter), 911TR, 911ST, 914, 914/6\nGroup 4: Weissach Cup: 904-6 cyl, 906, 910, 907, 908, 908/2, 908/3 (8 cyl. & 6 turbo), 909, 917 (normally aspirated and turbocharged)\nGroup 5: Carrera Trophy: 911 (over 2.5 liter), RSR, 3.0 RSR, 2.1 Turbo, 934, 935, 936, 924 GTS, 924 GTR\nGroup 6: Stuttgart Cup: 956, 962, GT1, WSC, RS Spyder, 964 , 993 , 996, 997 GT cars\nGroup 7: Rennsport Reunion Cup – Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge\nPicture 5, Concourse on Pit Lane, Porsche 917/30\nPicture 6, Concourse on Pit Lane\nExpect modern, vintage, and possibly some rare Porsches to be on display.

0675_17546bc4-7bf0-444e-887a-f1b72a713416	New TD Ameritrade Institutional Program Seeks to Help RIAs Spend More Time Serving Clients and Cultivating Prospects \n\nJERSEY CITY, N.J. -- (Business Wire) \n\nTime is a precious asset, yet registered investment advisors (“RIAs”) can lose countless hours to low-value work, disorganization or performing tasks they shouldn’t be doing in the first place. \n\nAvoiding time traps starts with advisors taking responsibility for how they spend their day. Personal time management and setting priorities are some of the key components of TD Ameritrade Institutional’s1 latest practice management program, Breakout GrowthTM: Driving Business Performance Through Efficiency, which shows how RIA firms can improve their top-line performance by focusing on efficiency. \n\nRunning an efficient business starts with a clear, strategic vision and streamlining operations, but achieving meaningful productivity gains also requires better time management at an individual level by advisors and their teams. \n\nTracking Time Traps \n\nAs part of the Breakout Growth program, advisors track how much time they devote to different tasks for at least two weeks. Through this exercise, advisors can better understand how they actually spend their time and evaluate the results against the firm’s priorities and goals. \n\nWhen advisors scrutinize how they spend their days, they may find some of these common workplace time traps: 2 \n\nDoing tasks that should be delegated \n\nDrop-in office visitors \n\nE-mail interruptions \n\nPaperwork \n\nTelephone interruptions \n\nToo much socializing \n\nAnd while incoming phone calls, client e-mails and business travel can’t always be avoided, many productivity-killers can be addressed by advisors improving their own work habits and personal organization: \n\nConfusion over job roles \n\nInability to say “no” \n\nLeaving tasks unfinished \n\nNot using technology effectively \n\nProcrastination \n\nTrying to do too much \n\nOnce an advisor identifies the sources of distraction, they can create a plan to make better time choices, focusing more of their day on high-value work, said Vanessa Oligino, director of Business Performance Solutions at TD Ameritrade Institutional. \n\n“You cannot totally eliminate distractions that arise in your daily life, but becoming more aware of what impacts your ability to accomplish your goals is the first step in changing your behavior and increasing your overall productivity,” Oligino said. “If people are frequently dropping in to your office and you have a hard time turning them away, for example, consider reserving specified hours for visitors.” \n\nEfficiency is the New Black \n\nThough working on “efficiency” may not be the most exciting task, TD Ameritrade Institutional believes doing more with less can be inspiring when you look at the numbers. \n\nForward-thinking advisors whose business strategy includes a focus on efficiency, on average, experienced 2.2 times higher annual revenue growth and 46 percent greater owner-income per revenue-dollar than their peers.3 And though nearly half of RIA firms say efficiency is one of the most important growth drivers, three out of five business plans lack implementation details.3 \n\nThrough Breakout Growth: Driving Business Performance Through Efficiency, TD Ameritrade Institutional encourages RIA firms to look beyond growth objectives – such as increasing assets -- when making strategic plans. The program intends to show advisors how firms of any size can boost productivity by implementing problem-solving techniques, making better decisions about which tasks to delegate or outsource and making better use of technology tools. \n\nTD Ameritrade formally kicks off the 2015 campaign today, Sept. 24, with a webcast, “Building a Culture of Efficiency to Drive Your Business Forward,” featuring guest speaker Robert Miller of Arches Institute. \n\nAdvisors can register to attend regional workshops that will explore the efficiency strategies of top firms. The first workshop takes place in New York, Oct. 6-7, followed by meetings in Atlanta, San Francisco and Chicago. TD Ameritrade clients also may access Breakout Growth content here, including a new perspective paper, “Running an Efficient Business,” that shows how improved efficiency fuels growth. \n\nTo learn more, send email to businessperformance@tdameritrade.com or call (800) 934-6124. \n\nTD Ameritrade and Arches Institute are separate, unaffiliated firms and are not responsible for one another's policies or services. \n\nAbout TD Ameritrade Institutional \n\nTD Ameritrade Institutional is a leading provider of comprehensive brokerage and custody services to more than 5,000 fee-based, independent registered investment advisors and their clients.

I didn’t look at them.” On Sunday’s “Meet the Press.” He then played Clinton’s remarks on March 10 at the UN, where she stated, “We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails, and deliver them to the State Department.

0681_fd4eea6a-c15e-43c4-b858-8bc52cc36d8f	If you haven't finished watching the entire video, I recommend you do so as soon as you can.  I thought there were many very good points raised.  A few more quotes below:\nSpeaking of Marx’s acceptance of communion for remarried divorcees and his statement that the Church in Germany “is not a subsidiary of Rome,” Archbishop Lenga said, “There was Marx, Karl Marx. And if present Marx says similar things, then there is no real difference.” [Heh.  Good point.  We need far more leaders speaking with this kind of clarity!]\n\nLenga, the emeritus archbishop of Karaganda, Kazakhstan, added that if the Church in Germany thinks they are so superior, “it’s some kind of Phantom, we should chase it away by the sign of the Cross.”\n\n“The Pope during the Synod will show whose side he is on,” said Archbishop Lenga. “If he accepts the statement of those who want to distribute Holy Communion to the divorced, there would be a heresy in the Church, and if he does not accept, there could be a schism in the Church.” [So we can likely expect some weasel-worded compromise that in essence gives the modernists what they want without a real explicit declaration to that end.  I expect maximum confusion and minimal clarity, but I also confidently hope for a miracle and that Christ's truth will be clearly proclaimed]\n\nLenga concluded, “Either we are on the side of Christ, or on the side of the devil. There is no third option. The common people are sometimes closer to Christ than priests.” [And is it possible, generally, that the higher one goes up the hierarchy, the less faith there is?]\n\nAthanasius Schneider, auxiliary bishop of Astana, Kazakhstan, who has been a spokesman for orthodoxy during the Synod crisis like few others in the hierarchy, says we are “already living in the time of schism” and points directly at Cardinal Walter Kasper as one of the main culprits. “These false words will be revealed,” he says. “Christ said all that is hidden will be revealed and these strategies of Cardinal Kasper and his group will be revealed as a lie, a strategy that is against the spirit of Christ and the apostles.” [I think they already have!  But only among those with eyes to see. For the rest, the media campaign and the blinding glare of the world's allurements have kept them from seeing.  Many do not want to see.]\n\nCardinal Burke concurs that “we’re in a time of crisis within the church,” suggesting that “we may have to give our all (including our very lives) to safeguard and promote the truth of the faith not only for ourselves and our own generation but also for those to come.”\n\nBurke is blunt about the current state of the Church confronting heretical positions coming from those high up in its leadership. “If this means that Cardinals will be opposed to Cardinals then we simply have to accept the fact that that's the situation in which we find ourselves,” he said. “Certainly for my part I don’t look for this kind of conflict but in defending the truth of the faith I end up in a disagreement or conflict with another Cardinal. What has to be primary to me is the truth of the faith.\nAbsolutely.  Even to the point of resisting Peter to his face, regarding which Vox Cantoris gives a helpful bit of catechesis.\n\nWe'll see what develops.  There is a petition with nearly 550,000 signatures including 150 odd prelates, there are statements by thousands of priests around the world to believe and preach what the Church has always proclaimed regarding marriage and the family, there are books being written, 15 or 20 cardinals openly opposed to the progressive effort at the Synod, and much else I'm sure that we're not aware of.  So there remain reasons to be hopeful. As always, the key factor is the Pope. As with Paul VI and Vatican II (and to a lesser extent, John XXIII) popes almost always get what they want (and probably always get what they want since 1870).  If it is Pope Francis' will to radically change the Church's approach to these critical matters - and we all know what the evidence says - then we can expect great suffering ahead.  But I perhaps naively always hold out hope.  There could be a major surprise, and it's quite possible the surprise has already happened (first there were rumors that the Synod would switch from a supermajority to a simple-majority voting pattern, but apparently even achieving the desired agenda on that basis is in doubt so now the rumors say there will be no post-synodal relatio because the outcome would not be that which is desired.  Wishful thinking?  I have no idea).\n\nNo matter what, no one, not even the Pope, can change solemnly revealed and accepted Doctrine, especially that which has been observed and practiced for centuries.  Yes, the damage that can be done is incalculable and we must stand with the Truth, always, but in the end the Truth will prevail.
0682_8ba4e2de-61ea-4029-9cd5-cb3ebe1ddc91	BERLIN - Germany's foreign minister warned Russia on Wednesday against increased military intervention in Syria, saying the Iran nuclear deal and new U.N. initiatives offered a starting point for a political solution to the Syrian conflict. \n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier made his comments after Russia, which along with Iran supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said earlier on Wednesday it had military experts in Syria. Assad is opposed by most Western countries. \n  \nGermany is keen to negotiate an end to the more than four-year civil war in Syria, but France is considering launching air strikes against Islamic State militants there and Britain is ready carry out more. \n\n"It can't be the case that important partners, who we need now, back the military option," Steinmeier told German lawmakers. \n\nHe expressed his dismay at reports that Russia is stepping up its provision of military equipment to Syria. \n\nSources close to Steinmeier said he was particularly dismayed at Russia's behavior and that his comments were aimed more at Moscow than at Paris or London. \n\nLast week, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would welcome Iran's participation in any negotiations aimed at ending the civil war in Syria. \n\nHer comments reflected changing European attitudes towards Iran since it agreed in July to curb its nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. \n\nWith Germany holding the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven economic powers, Steinmeier said he would organize a meeting of G7 countries and Syria's Arab neighbors before the United Nations General Assembly later this month. \n\nThe meeting would aim to raise more funds for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.

0683_af6a8e4c-ce8e-441a-8bd8-61c0ad416c5b	The Republican Party came into 2015 in enviably good shape. Not since the Roaring Twenties had it elected so many members of Congress, and it had never controlled so many state legislatures. Its presidential field was the strongest in memory and the most racially diverse in history. Democrats, meanwhile, were led by a lame-duck president and his aging, would-be successors. \n\nThen came a topsy-turvy summer of presidential politics led by the unexpected popularity of Donald Trump. And rather than fading away as many predicted, it has led to an even more tumultuous autumn: Just in the past week, one-time rising star Scott Walker dropped from the presidential race and House Speaker John Boehner stepped down. Both were undone by forces from within. \n\nBoehner’s final act was an attempt to stop conservatives from triggering a shutdown fight over the defunding of Planned Parenthood. That has been put off, but only for now. \n\nApproval of the GOP-led Congress is in the teens, even among the Republicans who voted for it. People who have never won elections – Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina – command higher support than the rest of the GOP presidential field put together and share an ability to force unwelcome topics into the news cycle. \n\nAll that is clear at this point is that the Republican Party is undergoing a volatile transformation. It is a party that knows what it doesn’t want far more than what it does. It has endured a yearslong skin-shedding, beginning with the election of President Barack Obama and growing even more intense at the end of his presidency, without having any idea what its next form will be. \n\nThe unrest was evident at this weekend’s Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservatives where, when Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced Boehner’s resignation, a ballroom’s worth of activists rumbled with applause. Donald Trump mocked Boehner as a weakling that nobody really liked. Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to follow Boehner out, for “the surrender caucus” to put down the gavels. \n\n“That’s one down, that’s 434 more to go,” said Jindal, a former congressman. “Folks, it is time to fire everybody in D.C.” \n\nBoehner’s departure was the third, and hardest, in a series of establishment body blows. The first was Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s departure from the presidential race. Never a frontrunner, he’d studied hard after his 2012 implosion, and he’d called Trump a “cancer on conservatism.” Voters didn’t heed him. \n\nThe second blow came when Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin who had emerged as a tea party hero in 2010 after taking on that state’s public unions, ended his presidential campaign. \n\nNeither man was an “insider,” and both disdained Washington. Neither could capture the anger of Republican voters. \n\n“If the country were looking for a courageous, hard-working, relatively quiet person, you couldn’t do better than Scott Walker,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. “The minute he gets up and says, ‘I’ve won three elections,' they say, ‘Next person.’ Trump changed the world. He ignited the legitimacy of being angry, noisy and aggressive.” \n\nBoehner’s departure, the least messy of the three, was the most understandable. No one’s idea of a liberal, the Ohio congressman had started his speakership with a ban on earmarks. He had smothered all of the Democrats’ legislative goals, most notably immigration reform. \n\nThrough committee appointments, he had turned House hearing rooms into murder boards for the Obama administration, not least after he created the Select Committee on Benghazi. \n\nThe problem was that the Republican Party’s conservative base had been promised more – sometimes by Boehner himself. The historic 2010 wins that gave him the gavel were powered by the tea party movement, which demanded the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and which Boehner indulged on the trail. In his first post-victory press conference, Boehner promised that Republicans would “do everything we can to try to repeal this bill and replace it with common-sense reforms.” \n\nThat never happened. Stand alone repeal bills were smashed by the Senate. The debt limit, which conservatives attempted to turn into a vehicle for repeal, was passed with a smaller package of spending cuts. In 2013 those same conservatives were joined by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., in a fight that briefly shut down the government, before it was re-opened with full Obamacare funding. In 2014, conservatives won another landslide, and McConnell, the new Senate majority leader, seemed to suggest that they could finally unravel the Obama administration, “reducing the funding or restricting the funding” for bad law. \n\nSomething that scares me, quite honestly more than this administration, is the inept bloated corrupt Republican Party led by the McCains, Romneys and – God forgive us – John Boehners of the world, who really have enabled this administration. As much as they go on their own they have enabled them and it has really run roughshod on everyone in this room. \n\nFrank Bellistri, 66, who attended a town hall with Fiorina in Sandown, N.H., over Labor Day weeekend \n\n“What happens when he vetoes an appropriations bill,” McConnell told Time magazine, “is you re-pass it.” \n\nSome minor tweaks later, the ACA is intact, and few of the president’s executive actions have been undone. The conservative movement, from its media to its grassroots groups, blamed anyone who’d worked in Washington. In a NBC/WSJ poll released Friday, 72 percent of Republican voters said they were unsatisfied with their congressional leadership. \n\n“Something that scares me, quite honestly more than this administration, is the inept bloated corrupt Republican Party led by the McCains, Romneys and – God forgive us – John Boehners of the world, who really have enabled this administration,” said Frank Bellistri, 66, who attended a town hall with Fiorina in Sandown, N.H., over Labor Day weeekend. “As much as they go on their own they have enabled them and it has really run roughshod on everyone in this room.” \n\nThe room burst into applause, and Fiorina was glad for the question. “I worked hard to help elect a historic Republican majority in the house and to restore a Republican majority in the Senate,” she said. “And not a lot has changed. It is a leader’s job to produce results. And so I agree that the results have been thin and the results need to be coming or we need different leadership.” \n\nThe parties have wandered into similar territory in other years, but they have never earned this sort of backlash. In 1999, a Republican Party that controlled Congress failed to achieve a conservative goal - removing Bill Clinton from office. Its base got behind George W. Bush, a Texas governor who talked about “compassionate conservatism” and compromise with Democrats. In 2007, a resurgent Democratic Party failed to cut funds for the war in Iraq, the issue that had won the midterms. Its primary voters split almost evenly between then-senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who had been there when the war was not just funded, but expanded. \n\n“War is the hardest thing for the legislative branch to stop,” said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. “When it comes to Obamacare, it doesn’t make any civic sense to people that the courts and Congress can’t stop it. We picked conservatives for the court? They don’t act like conservatives. We elect conservatives to Congress? They can’t stop Obama.” \n\nToday’s Republican base has not been so easily mollified. The groups that had thrived during the Tea Party’s heyday universally celebrated Boehner’s resignation on Friday, accusing him of weak leadership that enabled the Obama presidency. \n\n“Rather than fighting President Obama and his liberal policies, Speaker Boehner embraced them and betrayed his party’s own voters,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia who now runs the Senate Conservatives Fund. \n\nFor five years, Speaker Boehner has heard loud and clear from the people who gave him a Republican majority that they wanted conservative leadership. For five years, he has practiced surrender, capitulation and compromise of conservative principles. \n\nMark Meckler, Tea Party Patriots leader \n\n“For five years, Speaker Boehner has heard loud and clear from the people who gave him a Republican majority that they wanted conservative leadership,” said one-time Tea Party Patriots leader Mark Meckler. “For five years, he has practiced surrender, capitulation and compromise of conservative principles.” \n\nMany Republicans now in office owe their jobs to that sentiment. In some states, where Republicans control every lever of government, the anger can be directed. Nationally, it’s uncontrollable. The louder the attack on the president, the more the base wants to hear. \n\n“This is why outsiders are all leading in the polls,” said Gov. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a former congressman who served alongside Boehner. “This is probably a key part of why Boehner’s resigning. They don’t want to hear any excuses anymore – they’re done with that. If you say you tried, they ask, ‘Why didn’t you get it done?’   ” \n\nEchoing Boehner, some Republicans say that a polarized media and political debate have left voters confused. “When I go home, and I tell people what we’ve done, they have no idea,” said Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H. “There’s not a lot of attention paid to what the House of Representatives has accomplished. People get their media in very different ways now. They feel that there’s inaction in Washington.” \n\nThose same voters are gravitating to the outsiders, who assure them that they’re right - that Washington is beyond saving. In a current average of New Hampshire polls, Fiorina has surged into third place, behind only Carson and Trump. \n\nWashington Post staff writers Robert Costa and Jenna Johnson contributed to this report.
0684_a355e8c2-5160-42f7-9096-b2e63cf39e4d	(The following statement was released by the rating agency)\nCHICAGO, September 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published a\nspecial report \ntitled 'U.S. Medical Professional Liability Insurance' which is\navailable on \nwww.fitchratings.com.\nMedical professional liability insurance (MPLI) net written\npremium volume for \nthe U.S. property/casualty (P/C) industry fell for the eighth\nconsecutive year \nwith a 2.5% decline in 2014, reflecting changing market\nfundamentals and \ndeclining premium rates.\nThe evolution of the broader healthcare market and ample\nunderwriting capacity \nin the MPLI market point toward further weakening of MPLI market\nfundamentals \nand a gradual decline in premium rates.  The MPLI market\ncontinues to generate \nsignificant profits on a calendar year basis. The industry\ngenerated a \ncalendar-year basis combined ratio of 94% in 2014, which\nrepresents a slight \ndeterioration in performance over the past five years.\nCalendar-year results in MPLI continue to benefit from\nsubstantial favorable \nloss reserve development that averaged 22% of annual earned\npremiums for the \nlast eight years. This level is anticipated to diminish as\nfavorable development \nfrom recent accident years, which account for the largest\nproportion of all MPLI \nreserves, has been materially lower relative to past years.\nHealthcare providers are moving from independent and smaller\ngroup practices \ntowards employment with hospitals and large medical groups. This\nshift is \nchanging purchase and coverage preferences for MPLI. Large\ngroups are more \nlikely to self-insure and use captive or alternative risk\nprograms, reducing \ndemand for primary MPLI coverage.\nMarket share in MPLI is widely dispersed, as a large proportion\nof premiums are \nwritten by monoline MPLI specialists, many of which have\nconcentrated geographic \nscope. Most MPLI specialists have strong capital positions and\nlow operating \nleverage, but limited opportunities for business expansion due\nto a lack of \nunderwriting expertise in other markets. \nAcquisitions of MPLI specialists were relatively few in the last\nthree years. \nMerger activity in the broader P/C market has quickened in the\nfirst half of \n2015. Heightened expense pressure from a declining revenue base\ncoupled with \nprofit erosion from weaker underwriting results and depleted\nreserve \nredundancies could spur an expansion in MPLI transactions going\nforward. \nHowever, the mutual/reciprocal organization structure of many\nMPLI specialists \nreduces incentives for management to find a merger partner.\nThe full report is available on the Fitch web site at\n'www.fitchratings.com' \nunder 'Insurance' and 'Research' or by clicking on the link. \nContact: \nJames B.

He was 75. \n\nThe team said Pearson died Saturday after a lengthy illness. \n\nPearson worked at various locations within the stadium, creating meals for sporting greats, Hollywood stars and presidents of the U.S. In recent years, he cooked in the press dining room that bore the sign "Dave's Diner" in his honor. \n\nHis illness kept him away from his stadium kitchen for much of this season, although Pearson made a final visit last month. \n\nA Brooklyn native who cheered the Dodgers as a child, Pearson moved with his mother to Southern California at age 16. After learning to cook at a small restaurant in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles, Pearson took a part-time job at Dodger Stadium, launching a career that spanned decades. \n\nPearson's outgoing personality made him a popular figure at the stadium, where his friends included Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, retired Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda and team president and CEO Stan Kasten. \n\n"Regardless of the demands that came with serving so many people at a venue like Dodger Stadium, he always maintained his composure," Scully said. "To look at Dave, everything was always fine. He was always smiling. He was a great gift to us, both his cooking and the type of person he was. He will be deeply missed." \n\nPearson's hobbies included travel, tennis, jazz music, model trains and building dollhouses for his granddaughter. \n\nHe is survived by his wife of 10 years, Sherry, his daughters and three grandchildren. \n\nFuneral arrangements were pending.

0688_ff453ac1-4fa3-4fac-a7aa-ef536e74aff2	By ,   \nIn the wake of her stellar performance at the CNN debate, Carly Fiorina has shot to second place in the polls, and her ascent raises a possibility that should terrify Democrats: The GOP might just nominate a passionate, articulate pro-life woman as its standard-bearer in 2016. \n \nIf that happens, Democrats can say goodbye to their beloved “war on women” rhetoric. \n\nConsider: Hillary Clinton recently compared pro-life Republican presidential candidates to terrorists. “I take it a little personal when they go after women,” Clinton smirked. “Extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups . . . But it’s a little hard to take coming from Republicans who want to be president of the United States.” \n\nThat line won’t work so well if the Republican running for president of the United States is a woman. \n\nNeither will Clinton’s oft-repeated complaint that Republicans trying to defund Planned Parenthood want to eliminate access to breast cancer screening. “I would like these Republican candidates to look the mom in the eye who caught her breast cancer early because she was able to get a screening for cancer,” Clinton said . \n\nFiorina does not have to look that mom in the eye — because she is that mom. “I’m a breast cancer survivor,” she told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” this weekend. “Of course we should be funding those things. But I find it fascinating that Democrats will never support taxpayer funding, for example, for a women’s health center right next door to a Planned Parenthood [clinic] that would provide all those same services and also provide women an alternative to abortion.” \n\nBoom. \n\nFiorina argues persuasively that it is Democrats, not Republicans, who are “extreme” when it comes to abortion. Speaking at the Susan B. Anthony List dinner this year, Fiorina described how “women come up to me and say, ‘I agree with Republicans on so many things, but I just can’t support this extreme pro-life platform of the Republican Party.’ And the way I answer that always is to say, ‘Well, I can respect that. Have you ever read the Democratic Party platform? Well, here’s what it says: Any abortion, at any time, at any point in a woman’s pregnancy, for any reason, to be paid for by taxpayers. . . . Do you agree with that?’ Nobody agrees with that! Even people who think they are pro-choice don’t agree with that.” \n\nShe speaks eloquently about how Democrats laud sound science — except in matters of when life begins. “For those of us who believe in the sanctity of Life, science is indeed proving us right every day,” she recently told voters in Iowa. “The DNA in a zygote is precisely the same DNA as the day we die.” \n\nIn her home state of California, she says, lives and livelihoods have been destroyed because of the extreme lengths to which liberals have gone to protect the lives of fish, frogs and even flies. “Liberals may not know when life begins,” Fiorina says , “but surely even they would argue that a human life is worth more than a fly’s.” \n\nFiorina came to her pro-life views after graduating high school, when she went to work as a volunteer at a school for special-needs children. She grew close to an African American boy with Down syndrome named Kenneth and spent over a month teaching him how to name his eyes and his ears and understand what they did. “I remember to this day the look of absolute joy and triumph on Kenneth’s face when he finally mastered the ability to say ‘Eye’ and ‘Eee,’ ” she recalled recently during a speech at the Heritage Foundation. \n\nMonths later, after her first semester in college, she returned to visit the school, and when Kenneth saw her ran up and jumped into her arms and, pointing to his eyes and ears, yelled “Eye! Eee!” “That was a moment of joy and grace that Kenneth gave me,” Fiorina recalled. The lesson she learned is “every human life has potential and every human life is precious.” \n\nFew know this softer side of Carly Fiorina. But in the weeks and months ahead, they will learn more about her. \n\nDuring last week’s debate , Fiorina looked into the camera and dared Hillary Clinton to watch the Planned Parenthood tapes. “Whether you’re a pro-choice woman or a pro-life woman, this video tape is depraved,” she recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview. “It’s Hillary Clinton’s position that women should not be permitted to look at an ultrasound before an abortion, yet people who are trying to harvest body parts can use ultrasound to ensure that these body parts are preserved so they can be sold.” \n\nIf Fiorina gets the nomination, perhaps she can deliver her dare directly to Clinton on the presidential debate stage. I suspect Clinton won’t fare much better going head-to-head with Fiorina than Donald Trump did. \n\n Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive , follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on

The week-long event encourages the GEAR UP community to raise awareness and champion the ongoing success of the college preparedness program. \n \n"What we need to do this week is to reinforce the community investment and buy-in, and let people know about our [GEAR UP] programs," Congressman Fattah said in his statement . "Like here in Philadelphia, we have 35 schools, thousands of young people, who are now launching in to our new GEAR UP grant." \n \nIntroduced by Congressman Fattah, and signed into law by President Clinton in 1998, GEAR UP has helped more than 12 million students nationwide and has earned accolades for its approach and emphasis on using best practices in preparing students from low-income backgrounds for college.

0691_8feea423-faeb-41f4-98f4-92d157018f4c	0John Stringer is served Defamation suit by Colin CraigStringer writes\tCC has dropped his trumpeted $600,000 damages in the suit, which he said he would increase after I went to the Police (investigation ongoing), pitching instead for $50,000 and unspecified amounts he wants to cite at trial (which could be an award to me, depending on how this goes). I have received a WHOLE lot of more delicate information from several sources since Colin made his threats and began this punitive expedition. My armoury is bursting and my quiver is full. I’m glad and welcome this serving. I was beginning to think Colin had stood me up, abandoning his threat trumpeted on TV at a special (third) press conference described by the media present as “bizarre.” Now we can have it all out and discuss everything in detail. The truth will out, or as Colin puts it… The defamation suit is 3.5cm thick but is essentially just copies of my blog which for over 18 months was a vigorous and vocal support of Colin Craig (gee I now regret that) against a running tide. Craig’s suit essentially cites my blog since June which outlines all the facts of what has been described as one of NZ’s worst political implosions ever. The blog outlines facts I’m happy to attest to; whom multiple witnesses will attest to by way of direct testimony; and which I will rigorously defend as true with documented evidence.\nI hear through the grapevine that Stringer is absolutely chomping at the bit to argue this in court.  He also has instigated action against Colin Craig through the Privacy Commission.  He has instigated action against Colin Craig through the Electoral Commission.  And he has paid for advice as to how to take Colin Craig to court himself for defaming him in the infamous booklet, just like Jordan Williams has, and I am doing too. I’ve also heard there are additional investigations going on into Craig relating to his company and his personal life.  These things happen when you accuse people of being liars, and then challenge them to prove you wrong.   It’s a natural progression for them to start finding out everything about you, so that they can defend themselves in court.   Colin Craig has made his credibility the issue, and the fact that he has only spoken the truth and done the right things are pivotal to his case.   It’s only going to require him to be proven wrong on one of them for him to be unseated from his high horse.  Two will make people frown.  Three and there is reasonable doubt.  Four and they will shake their heads.  Five or more and people will turn their backs. I can assure you we have at least ten provable issues that show Colin Craig has been deceitful.  And it is no wonder Stringer and Williams can’t wait to have the first bite at Colin Craig.  There may be a limited amount of funds to take damages from. People have wondered why this blog has gone completely silent about Colin Craig.   The short answer is:  it suits me.  I’m facing the loss of $650,000, plus costs and incidentals.  Like the other defendants, Stringer and Williams, I intend to turn that around, and make Colin justify his publication by asking him to prove it item by item. I’ll share more when the timing is right.  In the mean time, I’m quite electrified about the prospect that Colin Craig’s adoption of this strange course of action is not only going to fail, it may end his political dreams, his marriage and his business.   And not because of people telling the truth about him, but because putting faulty legal threats about caused them to turn his life inside out looking for additional proof Mr Colin Craig isn’t who he wants us to think he is.

0692_1217a243-020d-4aae-9f30-fae5c5681f1d	T his morning, Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz firmly rebuffed the demands of a growing intra-party insurrection over her planned presidential debate schedule, which Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley says is “rigged” in favor of Hillary Clinton. \n \n“We’re going to have six debates. Period,” Wasserman-Schultz told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday. The DNC chair shrugged off calls from O’Malley, Bernie Sanders, and two DNC vice chairs to hold more debates and scrap its so-called “exclusivity clause,” which punishes candidates who participate in any additional debates. \n \n“We are not changing the process,” she stressed. “We are having six debates, and candidates will be uninvited from any subsequent debates if they accept an invitation to a debate outside of the six DNC-sanctioned debates.” \n \nWasserman-Schultz’s defiance comes in the face of a burgeoning revolt over the DNC’s debate rules, sparked by O’Malley’s speech at the Democratic party’s summer meeting in Minneapolis two weeks ago. In front of the assembled DNC delegates — and just feet away from Wasserman-Schultz — O’Malley said the limited debate schedule was “rigged” to benefit Clinton, whose front-runner status is rapidly diminishing. Fellow candidate Bernie Sanders agreed, joining O’Malley’s call to expand the debate schedule and scrap the exclusivity clause. \n \nOn Wednesday, two top Democratic officials threw their lot in with the insurgents . DNC vice chairs Tulsi Gabbard and R.T. Rybak said that Wasserman-Schultz’s current debate schedule “limits the ability of the American people to benefit from a strong, transparent, vigorous debate between our Presidential candidates.” Gabbard is a congresswoman from Hawaii, and Rybak is the former mayor of Minneapolis. \n \nO’Malley called out Wasserman-Schultz directly on MSNBC Thursday morning, again accusing the chair of “rigging” the process and “circling the wagons” around Clinton’s candidacy. Allow Debate, an O’Malley-affiliated political group, is planning a September 16 protest in front of the DNC’s Washington, D.C. headquarters. \n \nAppearing unmoved by the uprising, Wasserman-Schultz explained to the assembled reporters that the schedule was designed to give all candidates adequate time to prepare. “It’s labor-intensive to prepare for a debate,” she said. “A responsible candidate comes off the road, has to devote time and staff resources and personal time getting prepared. Because of this window that we’re in, where we have the early-primary states that have that retail form of communicating, that’s also labor intensive, it’s important to make sure we give the candidates a schedule that allows them to really engage in that process.” \n \nAnd she laughed off the accusation that she’s rigged the schedule for Clinton’s benefit. “A couple of days ago, I think it was [the] Drudge Report who said that I obviously delayed the first debate to mid-October because I’m in the tank with Joe Biden,” she said. “So every day, someone is going to say something about my intentions. Like I said, I have a party to run.” \n \n— Brendan Bordelon is a political reporter for National Review .
0693_72a00fea-12ad-4537-8e3e-5d80ce21a3af	An off-duty firefighter has told how he made his way into a burning house after a suspected gas blast and blaze which killed two of his neighbours. \n \nPaul Archer climbed the stairs of the fire-hit property in Riddings, near Alfreton, Derbyshire, to search for casualties but was beaten back by flames and intense heat. \n \nPolice are not treating the fire in Valley View Road as suspicious but have confirmed that two bodies, thought to be those of a married couple, were discovered in an upstairs room. \n \nFire crews who tackled the blaze, which destroyed much of the building's roof, had to wait for several hours for the remaining structure to be declared safe before they could recover the victims' remains. \n \nMr Archer, who lives in an adjoining street, said: "I was woken up by a loud noise. \n \n"It didn't sound like a massive explosion - it sounded like something big had been dropped." \n \nAfter being called outside by his wife, who had seen flames at about 7.30am, Mr Archer, 48, put on old fire-fighting equipment stored in his garage, including a tunic, a flash-hood and fire-retardant gloves. \n \nThe father-of-two added: "The flames started straight away. One of the neighbours had got a key and they opened the back door." \n   Promoted stories   \nA dog - thought to be a pet bull mastiff - got out of the house as the door was opened and Mr Archer, who works as a firefighter at East Midlands Airport, went inside. \n \n"I made my way in shouting 'Can you hear me?' and the downstairs was really clear," he said. "I got to the bottom of the stairs, shouting again, and made my way up to the top of the stairs. \n \n"By this time the house was pretty well ablaze - the front bedroom door was on fire but I was shouting 'hello, can anyone hear me?'" \n \nMr Archer also saw flames in a rear bedroom and feared the roof might cave in, eventually leaving the house via the front door as he heard the sirens' of the first fire appliances to arrive. \n \n"I just thought I would try and do my bit," Mr Archer told the Press Association. "With our training, I might have been able to do more with the proper kit. \n \n"I only knew the couple to say hello to. It's just very, very sad." \n \nSpeaking near the scene of the blaze, Chief Inspector Steve Pont said the bodies had yet to be formally identified but were believed to be those of a husband and wife who lived at the address. \n \nAn off-duty police officer also joined the neighbour and Mr Archer, who went to work as normal on Sunday night, in initial efforts to help the couple. \n \nMr Pont added: "There was an attempt to get into the property but unfortunately they didn't manage to reach them." \n \nDescribing the deaths as an "awful" tragedy, the senior officer said: "The fire service attended and found the house ablaze. \n \n"They extinguished the flames and then found that the house was not safe enough to enter. We've been able to make the house safe and search the property and I can confirm that unfortunately there are two bodies." \n   \n Share article  \n   \nAsked to comment on the possible cause of the fire, Mr Pont said: "There were initial reports of an explosion. \n \n"There is substantial damage to the house. We can't say at the moment whether that's due to an explosion or the fire."
0694_1ccb61bd-142c-4ee0-90ee-69fb85b399a5	Ernest Moniz, US Energy Secretary\nThe Energy Secretary for the United States, Ernest Moniz, thinks that the costs of producing solar and wind energy have fallen so low that they would be competitive with oil and gas even without the subsidies they currently receive from the government.\nMoniz, who was trained as a nuclear physicist, explained to reporters that while the Obama administration is still in favor of the current push to extend renewable energy tax credits in Congress, there really is no need for them anymore.\nMoniz’s belief comes from very real statistics that show the solar and wind market gaining momentum. At the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, he backed up his ideas by citing rooftop solar panels, which could become as cheap as 6 cents per kilowatt hour in the near future. Wind energy is also falling in price, and electricity from wind farms is now cost-competitive with oil and gas.\nThe Wind Technologies Market Report from August 10 also demonstrates that wind energy is becoming extremely cheap, dropping nearly 5 cents per kilowatt hour in 2014. The report attributes this drop to “lower wind turbine price and installed project costs, along with improvements in expected [production capacity]”.\nOf course, the oil and gas industry continued to receive subsidies from the government long after fossil fuel extraction became cheap, easy and nearly risk-free. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect solar and wind to get the same chance by way of federal assistance.\nImage (c) US Government
0695_fd377221-e0d0-40e2-a55d-ef13f9dbef5e	Allie had just gotten home from work and was running from room to room, looking for her dress and heels for the New Year’s Eve party. Although she and her husband both planned on going to the company party that evening, Aleida soon realized she couldn't find him. Since she didn't want to be late, she decided to go to the party, hoping he came later. Hours later she received a message from Jake, her husband; “I just got home and I’m exhausted. Enjoy your evening out.” Even though he had promised to be there, Jake wouldn’t be coming. This is a story repeated again and again in many marriages. At the beginning of a relationship, you wouldn’t dream of breaking a promise! However, as time goes on, love seems to die. Allie starts to go to family events by herself, and Jake is hardly ever home for dinner. Luckily for Allie and Jake, they made the choice to not let their marriage disappear. She thought about how much she loved her husband and realized the two of them were responsible for the coldness and indifference in their marriage. Determined to not let love be abandoned, Allie left the party and went home as soon as she got her husband’s message. The two were able to talk things out, and made goals to have love be at the forefront of their marriage. Why does love die? In almost every case, love dies because the small details are forgotten. Eventually, tiny acts of service are abandoned, and gratefulness is no longer present in the relationship. It seems like a small thing, but these little actions help nourish a marriage on a day-to-day basis. Be sure to nurture your love consistently by doing these things: Find resolution Solving conflict quickly in everyday life is key to avoid major conflicts that generate resentment in your relationship. Don’t let days go by without discussing an issue that is bothering you. Some couples choose to not bring up concerns to avoid an argument or to spare feelings. However, when a major problem is discussed, all these little things are going to come to the surface. Don’t let unresolved issues be like fuel to a fire; choose to find resolution early on to avoid killing the love in your marriage. Be considerate There will be differences in your marriage, but that’s okay! It's only a problem when there is no give and take in the relationship. Be considerate of the differences in your marriage. Allie knows that Jake is likely to be late, but chooses to leave without him. Jake might not want to go to a social event, but he should have made more of an effort to let Allie know his feelings about going before it was too late. When you act without considering how it will affect their partner, love disappears. Seek out opportunities to share your thoughts and opinions about how situations will be handled. Page 2 of 2 - Express love If a couple starts to physically distance themselves, that emotional distance is also going to increase. Don’t stop the hugs and kisses, even when you don’t feel like being affectionate. The longer you wait to express your love, the harder it is going to be. Tell your spouse you love them often, and show love in your actions. Remember special dates Downplaying events like anniversaries or birthdays is another way for love to disappear from your relationships. Remember that marriage is a shared experience; don’t let those milestones go by unnoticed. Start traditions to create a unique identity as a couple; while the both of you are two separate individuals, you must also share certain celebrations that remind you of your life together. Don’t let these events slip by unnoticed. Avoiding monotony Getting stuck in a routine can be lethal for love. Just living life day in and day out leads to boredom and apathy. Every minute doesn't need to be adventurous, but avoid falling into the monotony of married life at all costs. This is a translation and adaptation of the original article, “ Así muere el amor ”.

0698_4d14d316-8f13-4c0b-a3ae-0b08b29bbff9	Story highlights The Democratic mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, is testing just how much voters will side with an outsider "I do not look like a typical politician," said John Fetterman, who said Monday he was running for U.S. Senate \nJohn Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, announced Monday that he was seeking the Democratic nomination to take on Republican Sen. Pat Toomey next year. Standing at 6' 8", with tattoos and wearing cargo shorts and a black, short-sleeved shirt, Fetterman announced his bid from a rooftop near Pittsburgh, according to WTAE-4 in Pittsburgh . \n\n"I do not look like a typical politician. Ha, I don't even look like a typical person," said Fetterman, who is running against Katie McGinty and former Rep. Joe Sestak for the Democratic nod. \n\nVoters have taken a shine to outsiders so far -- lifting up candidates like Sanders, Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, while peeling away from veteran politicians like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. \n\nOn the face of it, Fetterman fits that mold: he is a former Americorps volunteer, albeit a Harvard-educated one, who has spent the last 14 years working in Braddock to try and turn around the western Pennsylvania steel town. \n\nBut he faces one candidate with strong establishment backing -- McGinty has won the support of former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell --  and another with strong Washington ties -- Sestak. \n\n"I haven't done any polls, I haven't done any focus groups. I mean look at me. I'm not a polished specimen here," he told WTAE's Bob Mayo. "I'm going to either win or lose this race by being my true authentic self and telling the people the truth. And if me winning would require me being disingenuous or not telling the truth to people, I wouldn't want to win."
0699_82d8332e-dde4-40c3-a929-d47b7d470d97	“An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth” is a useful starting place for discussion of the influence of Pope Francis during his historic visit to the Americas. To modern readers, the biblical quote (Exodus 21:24) may seem cruel and brutal, but the Old Testament sentiment actually meant revolutionary progress. Ancient warfare involved unrestrained killing and pillaging. By contrast, this Hebrew law codified proportionality and restraint. Likewise, the Roman Catholic Church historically represents humanitarian progress, an essential point often overlooked in the economically advanced economies and increasingly secular societies of the world. The visit of Pope Francis to Cuba and the United States underscores the political influence of the Catholic Church. He is the first pope from the Americas, and the first from the intellectual Jesuit order. Cuba remains an extremely efficient and effective Communist dictatorship. The secret police has a long-established – and extremely well deserved – reputation for acuteness in sensing danger, and ruthless brutality in eliminating threats. Yet ruling brothers Fidel and Raul Castro had no choice but to meet with Pope Francis, welcome him graciously and treat him with respect. The Pope for his part walked a careful rhetorical path, yet spoke out for freedom and tolerance. Understandably, he did not meet publicly with dissidents. However, Francis’ message is clear, and impact of the visit may prove profound.  During the Cold War, Pope John Paul II provided historic leadership in foreign policy. He supported Solidarity, the successful trade union-based reform movement in his native Poland. That in turn contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and satellite states. The essential Christian message emphasizes compassion, and the Catholic Church over centuries has played a vital role in relief of hunger, poverty and human misery, and promotion of human rights. The cumulative positive impact is profound among the approximately 1 billion Roman Catholics currently on the planet, and well beyond. Today, hunger and poverty have been overcome for the great majority in industrialized nations, and political controversies there have generally focused on other topics. Francis is with political reformers on the left regarding the environment and capital punishment, with political conservatives in opposing gay marriage. Shocking criminal sexual abuse by priests is a principal contemporary challenge. Earlier this year, a tribunal was established to review and judge cases of sexual abuse. Francis’ predecessor Benedict XVI publicly acknowledged the criminal behavior. He met with victims, and apologized publicly. Historically, the Catholic Church has successfully pressed for restraint in war, reflecting the proportionality cited in Exodus. German Pope Benedict was extremely inspiring during a 2006 visit to Auschwitz. He confessed the limitations of language to describe the Holocaust. Contemporary analysis of ethics and military strategy is led by Catholic scholars such as J. Bryan Hehir, a senior priest and faculty member at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Page 2 of 2 - During the Cold War, Fr. Hehir guided the U.S. Catholic Bishops’ influential report on use of nuclear weapons. Such work continues after the Cold War. Hehir also bluntly criticized his church for mishandling sex abuse crimes by priests. In the U.S., Pope Francis has the opportunity to speak in the open air of democracy. He is the first pope to address Congress. In 1960, John Kennedy in seeking the White House successfully confronted – and defeated - anti-Catholic prejudice. Numerous Catholics since have successfully run for national office, including Vice President Joe Biden. Arthur I. Cyr is Clausen Distinguished Professor at Carthage College and author of “After the Cold War.” Contact him at acyr@carthage.edu.

My favourite London venue ... Looking forward to seeing you all". \n\nLast month the band hit the headlines over rumours about their future - shocking millions of devoted fans. \n\nBut Horan and his bandmate Louis Tomlinson told fans on Twitter the four-piece, also featuring Harry Styles and Liam Payne, would just be taking a ''break''. \n\nIt came after a report in The Sun that the pop stars are set to go their separate ways in March. \n\nA source told the tabloid the band will not tour their fifth album and will instead part company for a year because they want to focus on solo projects. \n\nIn a series of tweets, Horan, 21, told his 23 million Twitter followers: ''Ok so lots of rumours going round. We are not splitting up, but we will be taking a well-earned break at some point next year. \n\n''Don't worry though, we still have lots we want to achieve! Can't wait for you to hear all the new music we have for you and to perform some new songs as the (tour) continues. Love you all.'' \n\nIn March, the band vowed to continue as a four-piece after Zayn Malik's shock departure, which he said was so he could live like a ''normal'' 22-year-old. \n\nBoth One Direction and Little Mix found fame on The X Factor with the boy band having gone on to enjoy global success, acquiring millions of fans who are known as ''Directioners''. \n\nLittle Mix, who won the ITV talent show in 2011, have also had success on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\nThe bands have been linked due to former One Direction star Malik having been engaged to Perrie Edwards from Little Mix. \n\nBut reports that the pair had split emerged in August. \n\nThe pop star duo got engaged in 2013 but had never publicly announced a wedding date. \n\nThe Apple Music Festival, which offered fans the opportunity to win free tickets to see their favourite performers, has already featured concerts by Ellie Goulding, Take That and Carrie Underwood. \n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

0702_495caaa8-5eb3-4b34-98ad-60853509c131	England captain Alastair Cook kisses the Ashes trophy. \n             \nEngland's cricketers cannot afford to rest on their laurels after winning the Ashes in the forthcoming test series against Pakistan and South Africa, captain Alastair Cook says. \n \nThe three-test series against Pakistan, for which they leave this week, takes place in the UAE, where England were beaten 3-0 in 2012 and where Pakistan have never lost a series. \n \nThen they travel to South Africa for a four-test series. \n \nCook said the players were in great heart after beating Australia 3-2 in England to regain the Ashes, but that there is little time these days in international cricket to sit back and enjoy success. \n \n"It's been a brilliant couple of weeks off after you win such a big series, but it's amazing how quickly it has come round again," he told Sky Sports News. \n \n"There is no rest and the guys have to park the Ashes and start looking forward. \n \n"Winning away from home in international cricket is not done very often at the moment." \n \n   \n  \n     \n \nHe believes that will be particularly hard in the UAE, although "it's a brilliant place to play cricket because it's so unique". \n \nCook would give few clues about who might fill the troublesome opening batsman's slot alongside him in either series, for which Alex Hales and spinner Moeen Ali are seen as the main contenders. \n \n"We have to be flexible," he said. \n \n"We might have to have a short-term option. It might be that Mo opens the batting in this series and not in South Africa or that Alex takes his chance in a warm-up game. \n \n"So we have options and we have to be clear pretty early on what we're going to do. \n \n"It's a pretty tough job, [opening], you're playing against the best bowlers in the world who are fresh, with the new ball. And it's a big step from county cricket to international cricket." \n \nEngland arrive in the UAE this week and start the first test on October 13. After the three tests, there are four ODIs and three T20 internationals before the end of November.  \n    \n- Reuters

0704_1e2b1dea-729f-4080-8e34-a3c74065f27b	CLINTON — Deanna Posey is adding to her coffee empire, expanding her drive-thru java station into a full-fledged cafe. \n  \nIt's a move the Clinton native has looked to do for several years, and finally she has found the perfect home for her perfect coffee shop. \n \n"I've had the double-sided drive-thru for 10 years and have always wanted to expand, but I've never been able to find the right spot," Posey said. "I wasn't really in any big hurry, and I've always wanted a spot in this part of town because it just continues to grow, so when it opened up I knew it was time." \n \nThe part of town Posey now calls home is in the 13th Avenue North corridor, which has seen its fair share of growth in the past five years, including retail as well as food and beverage establishments. \n \nIt's exactly the environment she wanted for her first store front, and she is optimistic for what it will bring to the area. She is also making some new friends and business parterners with the upgraded location, including her new neighbor, Slop's Food and Spirits. \n \nSince opening Aug. 5, Posey and Slop's owner Josh Christiansen have developed a business partnership that allows patrons of both establishments to receive the services offered at each, a sort of "best of both worlds" approach. \n \n"There's a lot going on for both of us so we decided to do a partnership where people can come here for breakfast and then are able to order lunch from over there if they want," Posey said. "I think it's going to be a great partnership and something unique to offer to people." \n \nWhile Deanna's Java Cafe offers the standard baked goods as the java station, one special item Posey has added to the menu at the new location is a waffle bar. The bar features a variety of toppings including chocolate syrup, chocolate chips and marshmallows and so far has been a big hit among Posey's loyal clientel. \n \nIt's an effort she has implemented to not only satisfy her ongoing customer base, but is an attempt to encourage new customers to try out her shop. \n \nWith the drive-thru station, Posey has already reached a significant customer base, one that has embraced her new cafe setting, and one she hopes will take advanatge of the atmosphere she has created in the coffee shop. \n \n"There is a genre of all different age groups that come to my shop and I wanted to embrace all of them," Posey said. "I wanted a different atmosphere that would feel welcoming to everyone." \n \nSo far, in just a short time of operation Posey has already accomplished that with her customers, some who feel the establishment is a must-needed addition to the 13th Avenue North corridor. \n \nWhat she hopes is that will continue, and Deanna's Java Cafe will become a neighborhood staple, an environment for everybody and more than anything, something she can be proud of. \n \n"When I started the drive-thru it was because I wanted to work for myself, to do something postive and fun," Posey said. "We've had such a good time already; I feel like it's only going to get better." \n \nDeanna's Java Cafe is currently open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday with the intent to expand the hours in the future.

0707_2d6a3083-1e19-4751-a7db-0a9b5be7e68a	Peak fall foliage season and perfect weather has been keeping me outdoors all day long. Hiking, tennis, hiking! I will be posting about Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls in the next couple of days. (I hear there's rain in the forecast on Tuesday. Maybe I'll have a few extra minutes.) I read along with Katrina of Pining for the West and please don't miss her excellent post and summation about this Russian classic.\nAs I've discussed, I'm in the process of getting lined up for the Classics Club. Before I post my list, though, I'll probably already be reading several of Henry David Thoreau's classic writings for the Classics Club. His memoirs and thoughts about hiking in Maine, for one. I will keep you posted. It's the right time of year for reading a nature writer, because I feel especially close to the wilderness right now. I haven't read Walden since I was eighteen. I remember it so vividly that I'm not sure I'll be reading that title, but The Maine Woods, I'll definitely be reading.

0711_7a33827b-65d4-4cc4-b12b-c80e4a018647	Jenson Button could be set to end his Formula One career at the end of the season with an announcement on his future expected as early as this week's Japanese Grand Prix. \n \nThe 2009 world champion is in the midst of his worst-ever season in the sport with McLaren's Honda partnership having long since descended into a farce. \n \nButton has finished in the points in just two of the 13 races this season and retired from Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix with a gearbox problem. \n \n"Only my head knows, but my mouth and tongue doesn't," said Button, a 15-time winner, when asked if the time was right to end his stay in Formula One. \n \n"The race was mentally very tough.

0712_bf18adfa-0944-4a83-907b-3380ea6931da	(Before It's News)  \n\nThere may be no sadder political spectacle than a Republican governor running for president. He knows nothing about foreign policy. But he panders to Neocons who dominate the GOP and expect the nominee to advocate perpetual war. Then his presidential campaign collapses. \n \nSo it was with Rick Perry. Now it is with Scott Walker, who last week abandoned his presidential bid. \n \nThe Wisconsin governor won some significant domestic political victories. He tried to compensate for his nonexistent foreign policy credentials by claiming to be tougher and meaner than any other Republican presidential candidate. \n \nWalker assumed that to prosper “we need a safe and stable world.” Which was simple nonsense. When has the earth been “safe and stable”? \n \nNaturally, Walker lauded Ronald Reagan, who deployed the military in only three limited actions. Reagan was appalled by the possibility of war. Neocons denounced him as an appeaser for dealing with the Soviet Union’s Mikhail Gorbachev and withdrawing from Lebanon’s civil war. \n \nWalker contended that “America is not safer” than seven years ago. True, but mainly because of the dangerous military interventions he and other Republican candidates reflexively supported. \n \nThe Wisconsin governor talked in clichés: “We just need to lead again,” he declared. The U.S. did lead in Iraq, with disastrous results. \n \nOn the Islamic State Walker declared: “I’d rather take the fight to them than wait for them to bring the fight to us.” Alas, Walker confused ISIS with al-Qaeda. The latter attacked the U.S. The former wanted to create a state, which gave ISIS reason not to attack America—until the U.S. joined the Mideast’s latest sectarian war. Yet, argued Walker: “we have to be prepared to put boots on the ground.” \n \nWalker wanted the U.S. to jump into the Syrian quagmire: train more “moderate” guerrillas, establish a no-fly zone, and create “a broader, U.S.-led regional coalition, with real buy-in and iron-clad guarantees from our allies that they will help us shoulder the burden.” The first has been a bust. The second would trigger much deeper American military involvement. The third is a joke. \n \nThe governor promised to tear up President Obama’s nuclear agreement on his first day in office. Then, he said, he would apply “crippling economic sanctions and convince our allies to do the same.” \n \nHow? America’s friends would be less than pleased with Washington leaving them high and dry. Nor would Tehran be likely to yield to American pressure, having responded to every previous U.S. rebuff by expanding its nuclear activities. \n \nWalker also pledged to continue treating American defense policy as welfare. He echoed other GOP contenders in arguing that “we need to stand with our friends” since “our allies are among our greatest source of strength.” In fact, Washington collects allies like Facebook Friends. The Europeans, South Koreans, and Japanese all could defend themselves but don’t. \n \nOf course, Walker wanted to spend more on the military, even though very little of the Pentagon’s effort actually goes for America’s defense. The bulk is devoted to defending wealthy allies, rebuilding failed societies, propping up dictatorial allies, engaging in foreign social engineering, and undertaking other similarly dubious tasks. \n \nBeing a superpower means America has interests everywhere, but few of them are vital or even important. Being a leader means distinguishing between critical and minimal interests. \n \n “America will not be intimidated,” Walker insisted. But that’s not the issue. Avoiding involvement in unnecessary wars is the issue. He claimed: “we can no longer afford to be passive spectators while the world descends into chaos.” \n \nBut as I pointed out for Forbes online , “there is little the U.S. can do to create order out of chaos. Far more often Washington inadvertently delivers disaster. It would be far better to stay out of foreign imbroglios instead.” \n \nOther candidates likely soon will follow Walker out of the presidential race. Posing as uber-hawks is likely to work no better for them than for Scott Walker.
0713_b41e5f2b-a744-4e6c-bef8-9fabef5a787d	Pss. 19: 12 “Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.” I’ve made quite a few mistakes, I’m sure we all have and usually ones that we have to live with the rest of our life, like it or not. Since I began writing, well no, since I began blogging, my paintbrush of mistakes is in vivid color here. I hold nothing back and my truth is my healing place.\nSome people deal with their mistakes, some timidly live with them, some take the mistakes they made in life by the horns and wrestle them to the ground and shed them from their life never to be seen or heard from again. \nTo me, mistakes we made in our past shouldn’t be forcefully thrown in our face so that we have to live with the pain on a daily basis. Some people don’t deal with their mistakes very well and they live in denial as if the mistake is a joy in their life, never to be admitted as a mistake, but the pain, the pain is so evident when people live in denial. \nOne mistake I made, was not getting an abortion at 16 and spending nine agonizing months pregnant only to give birth to a stillborn child whose memory still haunts me to this day, some thirty-odd years later; then marrying the guy at 17 and spending 20 years of my formative life owning up to a pledge I had made more to God than my husband.\nLooking back at my mistakes helps me to see God’s hand in shaping me. I was the clay and he was the potter molding me into the woman I am now. I don’t have regrets in the choices I made and some may say I’m in denial but really; the CHOICE was mine, an act of free will that God gave to us all. \nIsa. 64:8 “But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.” Have you ever lived in a moment of should’ve, could’ve, would’ve? I normally don’t but as flashbacks come back to haunt me, writing about what could’ve been helps me for some odd reason. \nIt helps me because with all of the looking back, I see myself exactly where I should be and any amount of changes in what ‘could’ve been’, only changes segments in the here and now. At this juncture, I would not want one thing to change. My pain and my suffering, (that of which no one understands except myself) is what helps me to be non- judgmental to others who are suffering through their own mistakes.\nI do believe that our mistakes are little tools in our life that carve out who and what we become. I need to see that living with no regret is where my mind and body is supposed to be at this moment.\nJob 19: 4 “And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.” Mistakes should never be used to make people bend to your whim, they should be treated with the soft-skinned hands of a person who has grown and learned from their mistakes. A mistake can be seen as a work of art instead of a hold-over-your-head lifetime of remembrance.\nI think what I’m trying to say in short is this: Mistakes are sometimes blessings in disguise. Not that they are rainbows and unicorns and should be seen as such but that they are clay and mistakes are what molded you.

0715_1cc5e142-bf66-4725-8a26-d8fa8b48153d	The Walking Dead is more than just a zombie show. It's horror, true, but the AMC series is equal parts horror and dramatic thriller. Often times, the thrills originate despite the zombies. In a post-apocalyptic world not far removed from the one we know, the show doesn't ignore the perilous effect such an event would have on the human psyche. The main characters, led by Rick (Andrew Lincoln), are always in danger, externally and internally. The zombies are a constant threat; the humans they encounter can never be trusted; and, sometimes, even friends become foes. It's the versatility of the horror on The Walking Dead that makes it special. Zombie movies have been around a long time so the subject matter is nothing new. But Walking Dead fans know the scares can come from many places, like certain movies. Here are 10 films that either influence the show or use some of the same scare tactics. See them all if you can't get enough of following Rick and the gang around the post-apocalyptic wasteland. 1. Night of the Living Dead (1968) White Zombie, from 1932, is usually cited as the very first zombie movie ever made, but George Romero's Night of the Living Dead ushered the freaks into modernity. The image of the relentless undead flesh eater began here. The Walking Dead paid homage to Night, which is chiefly set inside a barn as the zombies try to get in, with its own claustrophobic episode set in a church. 2. Dawn of the Dead (1978) Romero's sequel to Night uses the familiar one setting formula (inside a mall) to thrilling effect but the film has more to say. The human survivors aren't mere victims, but reflections of humanity. Bad people still exist at the end of the world, and some of them even have time to rob, pillage, and steal. The Walking Dead doesn't forget this fact: People are still people, with zombies hunting them or not. 3. 28 Days Later (2002) The one film on this list most like The Walking Dead may be Danny Boyle's 2002 masterpiece 28 Days Later. It begins with a man in a hospital waking up to find the world as he knew it is gone (as TWD does) and it follows his journey through the madness. En route, he encounters friend and foe alike and Boyle uses breaks in the action to establish backstory and adhere us to the characters.  4. 28 Weeks Later (2007) The 28 Days Later sequel was one precursor for Fear the Walking Dead, the Walking Dead spin-off currently airing on AMC. It's a parallel movie, taking place in the same relative timeframe as 28 Days Later except in a different location and following different characters.  5. Dawn of the Dead (2004) Although The Walking Dead boasts little humor while trafficking exclusively in danger, you can still see thumbprints from Romero and from Zack Snyder, who directed the Dawn of the Dead remake in 2004. The remake features a great "final girl" in Sarah Polley's Ana Clark and a nightmarish ending that leaves the heroes still in peril. 6. Planet Terror (2007) There's nothing specific to link Robert Rodriguez's batshit grindhouse homage, Planet Terror, to The Walking Dead, apart from being a zombie movie. I just really like it. Well, maybe there is. Both have badass female characters with cool weapons: Cherry Darling with her machine gun leg, and Michonne, who wields twin samurai swords. 7. The Road Like The Walking Dead, The Road is a humorless post-apocalyptic odyssey with narrow focus. Based on Cormac McCarthy's Pulizer Prize-winning novel, The Road is the story of a man and his son as they do their best to survive a hellish new world.  8. Exit Humanity (2012) Set in the antebellum south, this lesser-known horror film is a hidden gem. It will remind you of The Walking Dead thanks to its forest setting and the hero's search for his son, which leads him into zombie hell (which has already claimed his wife). Plus, the zombies are awesome in this. 9. The Battery The Battery runs on humor as well as horror but Walking Dead fans will appreciate the amount of downtime that occurs when the world ends, zombies running amuck or not. It also focuses on the relationship between the two living characters, who can't seem to get along. We see plenty of that on The Walking Dead. Plus: amazing poster. 10. Deliverance The suspense classic of the '70s features zero zombies, but it's an outdoor adventure that never slows down. Plus, I'd rather meet a zombie than the disgusting backwoods psychos from this film. "Squeal like a PIG!!" No thanks, buddy. Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest

0717_0d0f322f-a96e-497d-b603-80a1adb529db	Few global summits can compete with the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). All the world’s a stage, but the spotlight shines brightest each September in Manhattan, as global leaders gather for UN’s “back to school” night. But while most attention will focus on speeches from the green marble podium, the real action will occur offstage. This year’s most important side event is a special Monday afternoon session on UN peacekeeping , convened by President Barack Obama himself and involving leaders of fifty countries. Its outcome will help determine whether the United Nations gets serious about updating the most important weapon in its arsenal to the realities of the twenty-first century. \n \nSurprisingly, “peacekeeping” wasn’t even mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945. The concept was invented to describe so-called “Chapter 6 ½” operations falling between pacific settlement of disputes (under Chapter 6) and coercive enforcement action (under Chapter 7). By now, peacekeeping is the UN’s bread and butter. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO) commands the world’s largest globally deployed military force—more than 105,000 “blue helmets” and another 15,000 police and civilians, scattered across sixteen operations . These complex and multidimensional missions bear scant resemblance to the UN’s early peacekeeping forays, which tended to involve the insertion of lightly armed observers between parties who had already laid down their weapons. Today’s peacekeepers often find themselves drawn into combat with, and outgunned by, heavily armed groups, even as they try to protect civilian populations from slaughter. \n \nUnfortunately, UN peacekeeping is in deep crisis . The heavy demand for missions is outstripping the UN’s capacity to mobilize adequate funding, troops, equipment, and logistical support. Individual operations are repeatedly undermined by unrealistic UN Security Council mandates, unclear rules of engagement, weak mission leadership, and unprofessional—even criminal—conduct by UN troops themselves. The shortcomings have been on display in flailing UN operations from South Sudan to Mali to the Central African Republic. \n \nThe president’s message on Monday afternoon will be clear: these gaps can and must be closed. Strengthening UN peacekeeping is no humanitarian act of charity, no mere expression of global “ social work .” It is of fundamental importance to U.S. and international security. This is particularly true when it comes to the “arc of instability” that now spans west and central Africa, the Sahel, the Horn, the Middle East, and southwest Asia. Across this broad expanse, states are failing, humans are suffering, conflict is erupting, and extremists are plotting, generating regional instability, aiding criminals and terrorists, and even facilitating diseases like Ebola . And increasingly, peacekeeping is the instrument of choice for addressing these threats. \n \nPresident Obama’s commitment to UN peacekeeping runs deep. Six years ago at his first UN peacekeeping summit, he convened a meeting of major troop contributing countries (TCCs) like Rwanda and Bangladesh, the unsung heroes who place their own soldiers on the line in peacekeeping missions. Last year he asked Vice President Biden to convene a similar meeting . This year, the president has asked each of his fifty counterparts to show up with specific national pledges to improve UN peacekeeping, including offers to contribute more soldiers, increase funding levels, provide airlift and other logistics, or help train peacekeepers. As an initial down payment, Secretary of State Kerry and his Indian counterpart on September 22 announced a joint initiative to train troops in six African nations, as part of the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership launched at last year’s U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.  On Monday, the president plans to announce a far more comprehensive package of U.S. commitments. \n \nStill, the president will stress that the shared threats cry out for burden-sharing among UN member states. The summit’s success will depend not just on the individual contributions countries bring to the table, but on their collective commitment to structural reforms. To equip peacekeepers with the tools and training required to fulfill their mandates, the peacekeeping summit should begin by implementing the needed reforms identified by the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations (HIPPO), which delivered its report to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in June. Top reform priorities include: persuading more nations to become troop contributing countries; increasing the number of troops that current TCCs provide; improving pre-deployment training of national contingents; ensuring that UN Security Council mandates are clear and realistic, particularly when it comes to protecting civilians; specifying rules of engagement that are aligned with the conflict situation; providing peacekeepers with high-end military capabilities to defend themselves and thwart “spoilers”; adapting peacekeeping doctrine to counterinsurgency and counterterrorist threats; and holding TCCs accountable both for their performance in the field and any misconduct—particularly when it comes to crimes of sexual violence . \n \nThe beauty of UN peacekeeping, if properly managed and resourced, is that it can deliver the stability that the world wants without having any one country (including the United States) bear all the costs and risks. But peacekeeping will only succeed if UN member states redouble their commitment to give the United Nations the tools it needs to do the job in a professional and accountable manner.
0718_431a9c7f-f293-4ef5-a262-7b71dac39010	It's not easy being seen. \n \nJust because you're a celebrity frog hobnobbing around town with a new lady pig in your skinny Muppet arms doesn't mean you're dating her. \n\nA story in People magazine had said Kermit the Frog wasted no time moving on from his breakup with longtime girlfriend Miss Piggy and was now dating an ABC marketer named Denise. \n\nNot true, says Kermit. They're just "friends." \n\n"While I prefer to keep my personal life private, this is Hollywood, so who am I kidding?" he said in a post Tuesday night. "It is true that I am dating again. However, at this time no one woman--pig or otherwise--is my official 'new girlfriend.' We are simply close friends." \n\nAnd the response from Miss Piggy? None. She was too busy flirting with William Shatner (aka Capt. Kirk), who wondered if she's now available. \n\n"Very much available, mon cher," she tweeted. "Gimme a call! I'd love to boldly go where no pig has gone before." \n\nKermit and Miss Piggy, who were together for close to 40 years, have been slinging veiled insults at each other since the breakup was announced last month -- perhaps not so coincidentally in conjunction with the production of their new ABC show, "The Muppets." \n\n"Dating moi is like flying close to the sun," Miss Piggy said at the Television Critics Association gathering in early August. "It was inevitable that Kermit would drop down to the ground while I stayed in the heavens." \n\nIn response, Kermit -- who is producing Miss Piggy's "Up Late with Miss Piggy," the show-within-a-show of "The Muppets" -- noted that he was trying to stay above the fray. \n\n"We can be professionals. Well, one of us can. Me," he told the Guardian. \n\nApparently Miss Piggy has also engaged in diva behavior on set. Her complaints won Kermit a $20 bet. \n\nHowever, celebrities have lined up behind Miss Piggy. Liam Hemsworth has posted all of one photo to his new Instagram account, and it consists of the "Hunger Games" star with the porcine performer. \n\nFans of the Muppets -- or bad celebrity behavior -- will have to see how this all plays out on the TV show (which begins September 22, by the way). So far, however, no other Muppet is talking -- even the Swedish Chef. At least, we don't think he's saying anything.
0719_f227d7b6-32fb-4754-872f-3a8cfa0d4192	(CNN) -  \nPeggy Porschen's boutique bakery is filled with towering wedding cakes, decorative birthday sponges, and, when I visited at 10am on a Tuesday morning, little children deciding which cupcake to ask their mother for. \n \nWith such high-profile clients as Kate Moss and Elton John, a cooking academy around the corner, and her many recipe books lining the walls, you could say Porschen had the cake decorating business all wrapped up. \n\nIcing on the... \n\nFunny then, that Porschen's sweetest baking triumph is not a cake -- but an egg. \n\n"The Faberge egg I made for Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball was completely new and different, and went through the press like wildfire," says Poschen as she guides me through her parlor in London's ritzy Belgravia. \n\n"That is the job that put me on the map." \n\nPorschen has since created sumptuous desserts for the weddings of Kate Moss and Stella McCartney; the parties of Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sting and Trudie Styler; and the 70th birthday of Anthony Hopkins. \n\nBut the bigger the name, the bigger the pressure to get everything just right, and in the midst of this media frenzy Porschen says it's important to stay true to her distinctive style. \n\n"Sometimes there's the question of 'what if they want a design that I don't feel is me?' she explains. \n\n"You want to take on the commission obviously, but you also know this cake is likely to be very famous and this is a cake you're really going to be known for." \n\nWonderful wedding cakes \n\nAlong with the celebrity spotlight, there are the particularly high expectations of brides-to-be. \n\nPorschen often works with event planners to create stunning arrangements for her cakes -- one of her creations was once brought into the room on the shoulders of Chinese dancers. \n\nKate Moss's wedding on the other hand, was a far more relaxed affair. \n\n"Her cake was very simple and elegant," says Porschen of the British model, who married "Kills" rocker Jamie Hince in 2011. "It was decorated with sugar lilies of the valley and was soft, romantic, and relatively classic. \n\n"Her wedding was quite bohemian, relaxed, gardeny, and she herself was very relaxed. She was one of the nicest celebrity brides to work with because she was so normal and really appreciative," added Porschen. \n\n"It felt like we came to a decision on the cake very quickly." \n\nA very British bake \n\nAfter working as a bespoke cake designer in Germany, Porschen and business partner husband, Bryn Morrow, decided to set up shop in London around five years ago. \n\n"I'm originally from Germany, so I grew up with lots of cakes and lots of baking, but cakes over there are not as creative as in England," explained Porschen. \n\n"I wanted to be creative with cakes and it's very time consuming. So I think a city like London or a country like England was really where there was a market for what I wanted to do." \n\nSomething old \n\nWedding cakes weren't always the elaborate three-tiered white giants we have today. In the past, newly weds have been known to kiss over a pile of scones and biscuits, break baked goods over the bride's head, and even pass tiny morsels of cake through wedding rings -- all in the name of good luck and prosperity. \n\nAlmost 200 years after it was first baked, Porschen still pays homage to one particularly historic cake. \n\n"The one cake that really made all the difference and sparked the sugar craft in England was Prince Albert and Queen Victoria's wedding cake, because it was the first traditional wedding cake as it is known today," says Porschen of the 1840 cake which reportedly measured three yards in circumference and weighed over 300 pounds.

0721_ac431f6e-9751-405b-8290-d356658fa267	WASHINGTON: Chinese President Xi Jinping said he was confident that his country would post “healthy” growth in the future, amid international worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. Xi told a joint press conference with US President Barack Obama after White House talks that China had moved from “speed-based growth to quality-based growth.”  Chinese authorities are trying to rebalance the economy — which accounts for one out of every eight dollars of worldwide GDP — from one reliant on exports and heavy government investment in infrastructure to one where domestic consumption is the main driver. But alarm bells have been rung over how rapidly the economy is slowing, and whether the so-called new one is expanding fast enough to take up the slack.  Xi nevertheless insisted the outlook was solid. \n \n“We call this the new normal of the Chinese economy and I’m confident going forward China will… provide a healthy growth that strengthens confidence,” he said. The Chinese leader did acknowledge that his country was under “increasing pressure” of an economic downturn and “some fluctuations on the stock market.” China’s economy expanded 7.3 per cent last year, the weakest pace since 1990, and slowed further to 7.0 per cent in each of the first two quarters this year.  Xi said on Friday he expected growth for 2015 to remain at about seven per cent.  But the Asian Development Bank cut its growth forecast for China to 6.8 per cent for this year, instead of the 7.2 previously estimated, following a stream of weak indicators including on trade. — AFP
0722_f1193513-9254-44c1-92f8-25a34f0a685f	On Friday, my new iPhone 6S arrived. It'srose gold (otherwise known as "pink'), and I'm delighted with it.I traded in my iPhone 5C (otherwise known as "the cheap iPhone").I really liked the 5C. I had traded in an HTC Android phone for it, and although I liked Android and didn't want to switch to iOS, I thought the 5C was a lot of phone for the money. I paid $100 for it on contract. It was a good deal.Problem was, it wasn't even two years old yet and it was already having issues. The touchscreen wasn't too touchy anymore, particularly around the edges where lots of apps like to put commands.The iPhone 5C also didn't have Touch ID and other features of the 6 series.The larger size worried me, but turned out to be no problemI have a small hand, so I want a phone I cancomfortably grip with one hand. Plus I bike, run, ski, and so on,and the smallphone fits nicely intomy bike bag, running bag, and other packsI use.I was kind of worried that the bigger iPhone 6S would be too big (even though I was not getting the iPhone 6 Plus.)On the downside, that small 5C had such a small keyboard that it was a misery to type and text on. Especially because, some apps don'talways let you switch from portrait to landscape mode to type (I'm looking at you, Facebook).I'm happy to report that the new iPhone 6S is the perfect size!It's narrow enough so my small hand can still grip it. And I use the "Zoomed" view, which makes the icons and everything bigger. That also really eliminates that "clumsy fingers" feeling.I'm also happy to finally have TouchID. Press the button when the screen is blank toopen the phone. Rest your finger on the button when the phone is on lockscreen to go back to the last app you were working on. So nice!I set up multiple fingers with TouchID. And when the phone was having a little troublerecognizing my original thumb, it was easy to reset. (Settings/Touch ID & Passcode).3D Touch is a learning curve and kinda "meh"The new thing with the iPhone 6S is the haptic touch, which Apple calls 3D Touch.At first, every time I tried it as a shortcut on Safari or Camera, it didn't work. It would send me into Screen edit mode where the icons shake instead.I had to learn to press harder and faster.For instance, if you press hard on the camera icon, you get choices: "Take Selfie, Record Video, Record Slo-mo, Take Photo."If you press hard on Safari, you get choices to show Reading List, Show Bookmarks, New Private Tab, New Tab.Nice shortcuts, but not that big a deal.When using Mail,pressing on the messagegives you a short preview of the message.That's only nice if the person got to the point in the first sentence or two. Most of the time I seesomething like this: "Good morning, Julie. Hope you are having a great day." So I wind up having to open email to really find out what its about anyway.Press harder and the message opens and then you're in the regular app, with no haptic shortcuts. Tap the "back" button (as always) to go back to your inbox.The potential for this is really exciting. Fornow, there's only a few apps that use it. So it's kind of a "meh" feature.The camera is spectacular"Live photos" are awesome and hilarious. They are tiny videos, complete with sound.But I haven't found a way toshare them beyondhanding someone my iPhone to look. Emailing, texting, or posting them to Facebook turns them into ordinary photos.I suspect that Live photos take up a lot more space on the phone, too.All in all, I'm really happy with this new iPhone. It's like my old iPhone, which I liked, but better.If you've got an older iPhone 5, you'll be happy with the new phone.If you've already got an iPhone 6, my advice is to stand pat. 3D Touch will become more useful with time and Live photos, while fun, are really just a gadget.Just so you know,I'm not an Apple Fan girl. I don't find Apple products any easier or better than others' products. I use a Macbook Pro for work, a Windows 10 Tablet PC for "not work," an Amazon Kindle Fire tablet for reading, and a Fitbit Surge and Garmin Edge bike computer for fitness. My husband uses a Microsoft Surface Pro for work, a Samsung Note, and a Samsung watch. We have an Xbox One for our living room.SEE ALSO:How Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella uses an iPhoneJoin the conversation about this story \nClick here to read full news..
0723_2e4f6aba-bddc-4bc0-9a54-0ad73dbd7010	Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson celebrated his birthday Friday by poking fun at front-runner Donald Trump. \n \n"I guess the best birthday present is I heard Donald Trump had dropped out," he joked Friday at Heritage Action for America's presidential forum in Greenville, South Carolina. \n \n"Oh, wait a minute. That was just for today," Carson said. \n \nTrump at the last minute canceled his appearance at the conservative forum, citing the need to close "a significant business transaction" that was delayed. \n    \nTrump's cancellation came after he took fire for refusing Thursday to address an attendee's assertion that Muslims are a "problem" in America and that President Barack Obama is a Muslim during a campaign event in New Hampshire. \n \nTrump's campaign manager told CNN that Trump did not hear the questioner make those statements and only heard the questioner ask about Muslim terrorist training camps in the U.S. \n \n"All he heard was a question about training camps, which he said we have to look into," campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said.

0725_da4794dd-11a2-4057-830c-4403f74f3971	The UN chief has strongly condemned a reported attack in Yemen that reportedly killed an estimated 135 civilians at a wedding party and called for an investigation into the deadly incident.\n\nThe incident happened on Monday, with local medical officials accusing the Arab coalition of causing the deaths while bombing a village near the Red Sea port of al-Mokha.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies launched an air campaign in March against the Iran-allied Shia Houthis, after they forced Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.\n\nMore than 2,000 civilians have been killed in the ongoing conflict, according to the UN.\n\nUpfront: What is the solution to the war in Yemen?\n\nSaudi Arabia's official news agency carried no comment on the reports of the deaths in al-Mokha, but the spokesman for the Arab coalition rejected the claims of air attacks in the area.\n\n"Any intentional attack against civilians is considered a serious violation of international humanitarian law," Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said in a statement on Monday.\n\n"Violations of international law should be investigated through prompt, effective, independent and impartial mechanisms to ensure accountability."\n\nReports said the fatalities include children.\n\nTribal leader's account\n\nA local tribal leader told DPA news agency that coalition aircraft first struck a pavilion for female guests at the wedding in Wagha village, while the women were gathering around the bride.\n\nA second strike then hit the separate pavilion for male guests, Sheikh Abdullah al-Fadhli, the tribal leader, said after visiting the scene of the attack.\n\nAl-Fadhli, a member of al-Mokha's local council, said there were no military positions or Houthi fighters in the vicinity of the wedding party.\n\nLocal residents and witnesses said that coalition aircraft had carried out intense raids against Houthi positions in al-Mokha area in recent days.\n\nA Saudi official told the European Parliament that his country was abiding by international law in its military campaign.\n\n"Of course there is always going to be some casualties in any military conflict," Mohammed bin Amin al-Jefri, deputy speaker of Saudi Arabia's Consultative Assembly, said in Brussels.\n\nJefri made no specific reference to Monday's incident but said Saudi Arabia had been "very, very careful, and the government has been declaring that they have been taking all measures to ensure that this is to the bare minimum possibility in this area".\n\nSeparately, Brigadier-General Ahmed al-Asseri, the Arab coalition spokesman, denied the report in an interview to Reuters.\n\n"There have been no air operations by the coalition in that area for three days," Asseri said.\n\n"This is totally false news."\n\nRecent incidents\n\nA local Yemeni official said Arab coalition air strikes on a village in the northwestern province of Hajja killed 19 people on Sunday.\n\nAn air strike on a market last week in northern Saada province, the stronghold of the Houthis, killed 73 people, according to Yemeni health ministry officials.\n\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the claims by the government officials.\n\nAl Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra said there are no signs that coalition-led strikes are slowing down.\n\n"The problem that the international community faces in Yemen is that they don't see any potential political way out of the crisis," he said.
0726_4bf48e29-fccc-419f-bf61-d3ba8c120917	Somehow, Lisa got this! One of those mysteries of the cosmos! I just want to keep it...........\nHHHmmmmmm.............sorry it's been so long......... I thought about you all during the week, but..........well, maybe you will understand better when you get to the end of this...........\nI showed you pictures of my empty room..........that was Monday. Tuesday morning, first thing, the men came to lay the new carpet. Had it all done about noon and we needed to stay off of it for a couple of hours. Then it was time to come home. And I wasn't all that anxious to do the work to get it all back together........besides, I couldn't move the shelves.........\nWhen I arrived Wednesday morning--and I was late because we were having district meeting and we were taking lunch for all the Elders--12 of them. I made chicken enchiladas. Soooo........when I got to the office, the shelves were all in and several of the boxes--lots of them, in fact--and some stacked in the middle of the floor. Sis. Newman said they got that far and then she didn't remember how things were and didn't want me to feel that my toes had been stepped on........ When I stood there, alone, and looked around, the panic began to rise. This is one of the hardest things for me to do! Find a "home" for everything!! And have it make sense! HELP!!!!!!!! I was trying to remember where shelves had been (how far apart, etc) and putting some of the pass-along cards away when Sis. Newman came back in and offered to help. Bless her!!! I would have been fighting with myself all day long otherwise. It was so good to have a cohort!!! The Assistants were on exchanges--when that happens and one of them is in the office, the Elder with him really doesn't have much to do. So we put him to work. And WORK he did!!!! He lifted all the heavy stuff--boxes of books, obviously, and pamphlets .......and got them all on shelves. Then I had him bring all the rest of the materials out of the other room (the President's office). He barely finished that when Elder Sariah came to get him for an appointment. I was so thankful to have all that done!! Sis. Newman stuck with me until nearly everything was "put back". There were 4-5 odds and ends boxes left in the President's office that I cleaned out and took care of. But with all the help I had no panic and the room is all put back together. RAH!!!!! And just in time..........it's just two weeks to MLC again. And next week we have transfers............this is going to be a "sadder" one for us, as we know more of the Elders going home this time--including one from Ensley.\nThursday and Friday were really quiet days............in fact, I took a power nap (that doesn't sound as bad as just "nap") Thursday morning! I did a little filing for Roger after I placed my order for materials......mostly copies of the Book of Mormon--I think I ordered 800. That sounds like a lot, but that's only eight for each companionship. Roger and I took cars here or there for repairs etc.----well, only two; thankfully I had my embroidery and enjoyed working on that some. Pres. and Sis. Hanks came Friday for a little bit and I had a fun visit with her. She liked my embroidery and wanted to see the finished quilt, so we spent a bit of time looking online for it, but I had the wrong designer, so she didn't get to see it.\nAnd we found out D is in the hospital. She was scheduled for baptism day after tomorrow, but that is now postponed. We went to visit her today. She tries to be so brave and upbeat all the time, but when I hugged her she started to cry and just kept hugging me and crying............ I am learning that there is more heartache and uncertainty in the world than I ever knew. And it happens to real people. Most of whom we would love if we knew them. And there's really no way to take away the heartache.........we can help them endure it and live with it and be happy despite it. But it is always there. I'm also learning that it is the common lot of man! We are all in this together.............. We expect D to be out of the hospital soon and then we can plan the baptism. That will be a happy day!\nI'm going to make a separate post about yesterday.......I have a bunch of pictures and this is long already.
0727_5beb863f-26b1-4c2f-ba64-0c3e93e72162	The latest developments in Pope Francis' visit to the United States. All times local:\n\n8:50 a.m.\n\nMinutes before Pope Francis was to arrive at the White House, President Barack Obama tweeted a welcome message to him.\n\nHere's what Obama's tweet says: "Welcome to the White House, @Pontifex!" — that's the pope's Vatican Twitter feed.\n\nObama says that Francis' "messages of love, hope and peace have inspired us all."\n\nObama went to a military airport in Maryland to greet the pope for his U.S. arrival Tuesday.\n\n---\n\n8:40 a.m.\n\nChristian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and other religious leaders are at the White House to help welcome Pope Francis.\n\nBut some Jews are missing out on the excitement.\n\nFrancis' visit to the White House coincides with Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jews. They spend the day repenting and atoning for any sins.\n\nThe holiday began at sundown Tuesday and ends at sundown Wednesday — hours after the pope will have left the White House.\n\nThe White House says the invitation-only crowd of some 15,000 also includes people who don't lead religious groups or aren't connected with faith-based organizations but who just have "a great regard for the pope and his message."\n\nObservant Jews can participate in some of the pope's other events in the nation's capital, such as his address at the Capitol on Thursday.\n\n---\n\n8:30 a.m.\n\nRaeann Meier and Mary Darnell are among the lucky ones to land tickets for Thursday's papal mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMeier, who's from Round Hill, Virginia, won a pair of tickets in her church lottery and is bringing fellow parishioner Darnell.\n\nMeier says of Francis: "There is just no pope like this one." She says "Jesus hung out with the dregs — the tax collectors, the prostitutes" and "that's the way this pope is."\n\n---\n\n7:50 a.m.\n\nAn elaborate welcoming ceremony full of American pomp and pageantry awaits Pope Francis when he goes to the White House.\n\nThe pope is scheduled to arrive by motorcade at about 9 a.m., his car pulling slowly up the South Lawn driveway to a red carpet, where President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, will be waiting to greet him.\n\nIn front of an estimated 15,000 people who were invited by the White House to witness the historic moment, Obama will then lead Francis to a dais decked out with even more red carpet and red, white and blue bunting, and ringed by military color guards. The Vatican and American national anthems will play. Obama will deliver a welcome address to the pope, followed by the pope's address.\n\nFrancis will also receive a thunderous 21-gun salute.\n\n---\n\n7:05 a.m.\n\nThe morning light is just hitting the streets surrounding the National Mall in Washington, and already there's a buzz of pope-related activity.\n\nPeople hoping to catch a glimpse of Pope Francis during a late morning parade are lining up for a coveted spot along the route.\n\nPolice and the Secret Service are enforcing road closures in the area and directing foot traffic.\n\nThe parade is the only nonticketed event during the pope's visit to the capital, and a big crowd is expected.\n\n---\n\n6:30 a.m.\n\nAs a head of state, Pope Francis officially is in the U.S. on what's known as a "state visit."\n\nBut the formal ceremony Wednesday morning on the White House South Lawn will be slightly different from most state arrival ceremonies.\n\nFor one thing, President Barack Obama and Francis will not review the troops, as presidents do with other visiting leaders. That's because the pontiff controls no armed forces.\n\nNor will Francis return to the White House in the evening as the guest at a lavish state dinner, one of the highlights of most state visits.\n\nThat's largely because of Francis' busy schedule.\n\nThe pope is spending the rest of the day with Roman Catholic bishops and other church officials and celebrating Mass at Catholic University.
0728_0bc1fee7-c7fd-4772-92ec-a272225dc473	Over the past several years, incidents involving fake gold (usually in the form of gold-plated tungsten) have emerged every so often, usually involving Manhattan’s jewelry district, some of Europe’s bigger gold foundries, or the occasional billion dealer. But never was fake gold actually discovered in the form monetary gold, held by a bank as reserve capital and designed to fool bank regulators of a bank’s true financial state. This changed on Friday when Russia’s “Admiralty” Bank, which had its banking license revoked last week by Russia’s central bank, was reportedly using gold-plated metal as part of its “gold reserves.“ According to Russia’s Banki.ru, as part of a probe in the Admiralty bank, the central bank regulator questioned the existence of the bank’s reported quantity of precious metals held in reserve. Citing a source, Banki.ru notes that as part of its probe, instead of gold, the “regulator found gold-plated metal.” The Russian website further adds that according to “Admiralty” bank’s financial statements, as of August 1 the bank had declared as part of its highly liquid assets precious metals amounting to 400 million roubles. The last regulatory probe of the bank was concluded in the second half of August, said one of the Banki.ru sources. Another source claims that as part of the probe, the auditor questioned the actual availability of the bank’s precious metals and found gold-painted metal. The website notes that shortly before the bank’s license was revoked, the bank had offered its corporate clients to withdraw funds after paying a commission of 30%. This is shortly before Russia’s central bank disabled Admiralty’s eletronic payment systems on September 7.Admiralty Bank was a relatively small, ranked in 289th place among Russian banks in terms of assets. On August 1 the bank’s total assets were just above 8 billion roubles, while the monthly turnover was in the order of 40-55 billion rubles. The balance of the bank’s assets was poorly diversified: two-thirds of the bank’s assets (4.9 billion rubles) were invested in loans. The rest of the assets, about 30%, were invested in highly liquid assets. Or at least highly liquid on paper: according to Banki.ru the key reason for the bank’s license revocation was the central bank’s insistence that the bank had insufficient reserves against possible loan losses. The Russian central bank has not yet made an official statement. The first question, obviously, is if a small-to-mid level Russian bank was using gold-plated metal to fool the central bank about the quality of its “gold-backed” reserves, how many other Russian banks are engaged in comparable fraud. The second question, and perhaps more relevant, is how many global banks – especially among emerging markets, where gold reserves remain a prevalent form of physical reserve accumulation – are engaging in comparable fraud. Finally, what does this mean for gold itself, whose price on one hand is sliding with every passing day (thanks in part to what is now a record 228 ounces of paper claims on every ounce of physical gold as reported before), even as it increasingly appears there is a major global physical shortage. If the Admiralty bank’s fraud is found to be pervasive, what will happen to physical gold demand as more banks are forced to buy the yellow metal in the open market to avoid being shuttered and/or prison time for the executives?

0729_946e5742-2103-404e-a2ee-fe05cd2fa6ba	There’s this sense in indie rock with a lot of bands that they’re not out to conquer the world, that they’re too cool to outright say they desire to play to the biggest crowds out there. \n \nWith UK outfit Catfish & the Bottlemen , they’ve been vocal about their desire to play massive stadiums and blow up to becoming the biggest band the UK has seen since Oasis headlined at Knebworth House to the tune of 150,000 people in 1996. \n \nThis band is on the fast track given they sound a bit like if The Strokes were fronted by a British version of Brandon Flowers of The Killers. They’ve got a stadium sound, so who is anyone to call them cocky for dreaming they can fill stadiums in the next few years? \n \nWe got a chance to catch up with Van McCann and Benji Blakeway exactly one year after their hot debut full-length album The Balcony was released. They headline the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood this Tuesday, September 29, so don’t miss them! \n \nGrimy Goods: It’s been a year since their album, what’s it been like? \n \nVan: It’s been surreal but not unbelievable. We were just kind of spitballing back then. We just seen it this week when we went back to the UK. It’s just a strange feeling, mate. The reaction to it has been beyond belief. It’s been a year since we put that out and a year ago, we could sell maybe 1,000 tickets up and down the country and we just did 40,000 in eight minutes back home. It’s just proper surreal. We’ve gotten records for festivals for attendance. It’s just wild. But we want to come over to America and do it. It’s one thing doing it in the UK, but America is now what we got our minds on. That’s why we’re over here, trying to really make our mark.” \n \nBenji: We were in those practice rooms writing the songs with 20,000 bouncing to it in mind. We were writing it for that situation. To actually have that true and being in a tent with 20,000 people, it’s what we set out to do years ago and now it’s happening. America’s probably been about a year or so behind the UK but you can see the same patterns emerging and it feels like hopefully we’ll be getting the same level If not bigger over here.” \n \nGrimy Goods:  You’re working on a new record in Los Angeles, what’s that been like so far? The producer of the new album, Dave Sardy, he worked with Oasis at the tail-end and with Noel on his record, what’s that been like working with him, considering Oasis was an influence of yours? \n \nVan: The Oasis thing for me it was because all my old cousins were into it and they passed it down to me. They were into rock ‘n’ roll music and I was kind of into Dr. Dre and The Streets when I was younger. That music was always about lyrics. But the thing about Oasis, Noel’s idea of it I guess, the guy wrote a great blueprint. They always dreamt it and they made it come true, the way Muhammad Ali did or this UFC fighter Conor McGregor’s doing. I like that about them. [Sardy] did Chili Peppers as well, which Bondy is a big fan of. He did a Walkmen song. The only Walkmen song he did was “The Rat,” which is the song the UK press kept comparing us to when we came out. It just felt meant to be. I always felt back in the day, this second album I want Sardy to do. I wrote the demos based around Dave Sardy’s production and I sent him them saying I wrote this record for you to do and there’s no other person who can do this for you. It turns out we’re the only band that’s inspired him in a long time. He’s been making music for films. It’s just great to play to someone you’ve admired for that long and have mutual respect for you and we’re really quick. We did that first album in two weeks, we’re a live band, we’re a touring band. We rehearse for 9 hours a day back in the day, we’ve been together for eight years. When we turned up I think Sardy was expecting some kids who were just alright live but we turned up and we were ready to play. It’s just unreal. The sound he’s getting out of the songs we wrote is just mad. I just really think it’s gonna be special. The fans who were invested in the first album and think that’s good, I think they’re gonna be blown back by this one. This has eclipsed the other album, it’s just a different league, I think. We were just kids then. We’re still young but we’re growing up, we understand it more, we’ve been to America, we know what you guys need. This next album is why I think we can really try for your stadiums, your arenas, Madison Square Garden, all that stuff. \n \n\n \nGrimy Goods:   Reading interviews you’ve done before, your confidence is endearing and I read a quote where you said ‘If 1,000 people hate me, I’ve got a gold record on my wall that says 100,000 people love me.’ I just heard Noel Gallagher in that quote in terms of the – I wouldn’t call you cocky but supremely confident. \n \nVan: I love people who research our band. Me and Benji do these interviews all day everyday. We love doing press but when somebody looks into you, it’s so fucking good, so thank you mate. We saw the last ever Oasis show. The scene with that. I’m from just outside of Liverpool, they’re from Manchester. There are not a lot of bands we can resonate with. Most the big bands in Britain are from different places. All my cousins sound the same as they did and the same mannerisms, same sense of humor. To me, it was more if you watched Muhammad Ali interviews you’ll see more where I come from. \n \nThe exact same thing as I guess Noel and Muhammad Ali, there’s a guy called Conor McGregor in the UFC. He’s saying the same thing I’m saying in interviews except about UFC fighting. It’s just the way they talk. It’s all about exciting the people and anything I say, I’m glad you see it as confidence because the UK press tends to see it as arrogance. I’m just having a laugh. \n \nBenji: It’s all in the name of entertainment. People love reading the stuff whether they agree with you or not. People like to talk about interesting people. \n \nVan:  I think that we don’t play games. We say what we mean and mean what we say. I’ve watched a lot of documentaries and John Lennon was the exact same. … We’re only interested in writing songs. Unless we get someone like you who’s deadly interested in us and what we have to say, we kind of just have a laugh about it. You get asked all kinds of novelty questions, about One Direction and those kinds of things. When they ask what we think of them we can only say our opinion, and they’ll go back and write some stuff. I remember an interview back home and they asked what did I miss about being back home. I was like being on the road is amazing, I don’t really miss much. But I guess I miss my mum and dad a bit, my dog a bit. \n \nGrimy Goods: And that became the whole article… \n \nVan: Yeah, it became like, ‘Oh look at him moaning at being one of the biggest bands in Britain.’ It’s crazy. \n \nBenji:  A lot of people are too scared to say what they really think, they don’t want to offend people. I think it’s a lot to do with the way the internet is now. Because if you say something – especially if you write it on Twitter – then it’s there forever. No one wants to put a quote wrong because that could come and bite you in the ass. We’ll just say what we think and we stand by it. \n \nVan: We don’t think we’re God’s gift or anything, we’re just trying to excite. When we were younger, our favorite bands telling us that they were gonna play stadiums and they were gonna do this and go on, give you something to believe in. We always loved that, we admired that. When we were growing up and other bands would not say anything. When you ask Oasis or Muhammad Ali, they just had you believing it was gonna be fucking brilliant and had you buzzing for it. \n \nGrimy Goods: On Bonnaroo. Festival shows aren’t just your fan base, they aren’t just people who came to specifically see you guys or know who you are. I was in that crowd towards the back but everyone around me was losing their shit: \n \nBenji: That is one of the best things. We did Bonnaroo last year and played to hardly anyone. We’ve been back to Nashville a couple times between that and this year. To see the development in a year, having barely been in the area, see the crowd grow that big and singing all the words back, even as far back view, it’s amazing to see that. They took it so much longer to get to that point in the UK. It’s happening pretty quickly in the States right now, it’s a good feeling. \n \nVan:  That was for me and Benji — Benji got me into the Kings of Leon when we were younger and he gave me all their records when we were kids. He showed me this live version of them playing in that exact tent. Being very much fanatics of music, I was buzzing off of it. That Kings of Leon show was epic. I was just buzzing to be up there like they were. I like trying to put those memorable performances that stay in your memory, we really tried putting on a show like that for people. We only see what happens in the gig and apparently those 20,000 could go into our next gig singing all the songs. It’s just a nice feeling to know you’ll go down as a highlight for somebody who is paying a couple hundred dollars or quid and come away with you being one of their favorites. \n \nGrimy Goods:   Are you at all concerned about getting to a point where you’re so famous people find you unlikable? \n \nVan:  I think it’s a Bill Withers quote. They’re like, selling out, last time I checked meant you were doing something good, doing something right. You sell out your show, your CD in the shop. Anything selling out is a good thing, right? In terms of product. This is the music business, the music industry. Like anybody else, this is a way of life for us. This is all we got. When we’re selling out gigs or shows, how can you not feel euphoria? You can’t be worried about all these people. \n \nIf it’s people on the outside then it can never bother you. But if it’s fans who have been there since the start and they start getting disinterested and it isn’t because the music, that has to go down as trimming off the fat. They’re not fans if that happens. They’re not there for your music and we want people who are invested in our music. … It’s just about good music, good songs. \n \nGrimy Goods:   Recording in LA and being able to spend as much time as you’ve been here — LA is a really polarizing place where you either love it or hate it — so I’m curious what you guys think of this place? \n \nVan: I love it. \n \nBenji: Same. I love it, pretty sure the other guys love it as well. \n \nVan:  What’s not to love about it? Walking up the street is the funniest thing in the world. Because you can see the best looking picturesque couple you’ll ever see, and then right behind them will be some man in his underpants and dreadlocks. It’s just madness. I really love it. We keep getting told we’re starstruck by it. If you don’t buy into it then there’s a lot of, ‘Hey man, my brother was in Bon Jovi,” but if you don’t get too submersed in the madness, it’s great. We’re always spectators because we’re always trying to write about stuff and create things. \n \nInterview feature by Mark E.

0731_2f0023e6-1d94-48d4-a87e-51de6e56222c	MISSION, KS -- (Marketwired) -- 09/17/15 --  (Family Features) The dangers of distracted driving affect thousands of lives each year. Are you taking the proper steps to ensure a safe driving experience for you, your passengers and others on the road? \n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the numbers are all too real, with 3,154 people killed in 2013 due to distracted driving on the road. While many states have adopted laws to crack down on phone usage behind the wheel, real change starts at home, with drivers pledging to adopt simple safety measures and ensuring family members also make the commitment. \n     \nAs advocates for safe driving everywhere, the car experts at Edmunds.com offer these tips for safe travels behind the wheel: \n\nLimit the distractions. While it's always a good idea to have a phone with you in case of a breakdown or other auto emergency, keep distractions out of sight while driving. Turn your phone on silent, "airplane mode" or off completely before you enter your vehicle. Placing your phone in the glove box, the back seat or the trunk -- or even just in a bag -- can also keep the temptation of answering your calls or texts at bay, so you can focus on the road instead. \n\nJust drive. Many other activities can also be distracting in the car, such as eating, drinking, managing your entertainment or even putting on makeup. Make sure your car is used only for getting you from point A to point B, and save the other activities for your destination. \n\nMake it a family priority. Discuss the responsibilities that come with driving a vehicle and the hazards that accompany distracted driving. Set rules for your whole family so teen drivers know that you too are engaged in creating a safe zone in your own vehicle. Be a good role model even before your children are old enough to drive so they witness only good habits. \n\nSet a reminder for safety. Place a sticky note on your phone or a photo of a loved one in a non-obstructive location in your car to remind you of your commitment to safe driving. Tech savvy owners of the Apple Watch can download the DrivePromise app created by Edmunds.com, which is free and allows users to upload a photo of a loved one. The app will then detect if the wearer is in a moving vehicle, bringing up the photo as a psychological reminder to drive safely. \n\nDon't be a passive passenger. Spreading the message about safe driving doesn't stop when you're in the passenger seat. If you're in the car with an individual using their phone, ask them to put it down for their safety and for yours. \n\nBecome an advocate for safe driving, and tell your family, friends, neighbors and everyone you know about the dangers of distracted driving. Safer roads start with smart, focused driving.

0732_e086b3b7-c19c-4697-88f2-e3d23d0b06de	NSW: One woman every week day, on average, seeks help at Maitland Neighbourhood Centre after being abused by a man. One woman every weekday, on average, goes to Maitland Neighbourhood Centre for help because she has been abused by a man. \n\nCentre manager Naomi Rees said staff regularly saw women from the Maitland area who were trapped in a cycle of abuse or violence at the hands of a man.\n\nI’m going to start calling it what it is – men’s violence. - Naomi Rees, Maitland Neighbourhood Centre \n\nShe said many women could not escape the cycle because they had been robbed of basic freedoms, such as access to their own bank account, which made it almost impossible to become independent or financially support their children.\n\n“We see it all the time. There is still shame around it,” Ms Rees said. “We have people come in here bruised and battered all the time.”\n\nThe revelation comes after the launch of Fairfax Media’s End The Cycle campaign to highlight the prevalence of, and stop, ­family violence. \n\n“I’m going to start calling it what it is – men’s violence,” Ms Rees said. “I’m not going to call it domestic violence any more. That phrase has become too common and has lost power.\n\n“But non-violent men should not feel like they have to defend themselves [against the phrase]. \n\n“It would be great if they stood up when they saw violence against women in any way, shape or form and said ‘that’s not OK’.”\n\nMs Rees said changing the ­language around the issue was part of the way the public debate needed to be reframed to create social change and eradicate ­violence against women.\n\nShe said education needed to start with young boys and that sexist and disrespectful, but ­common, clichés should become a thing of the past.\n\n“I’ve been married for 37 years and I’ve had people say to me: ‘you don’t get that long for murder’,” Ms Rees said. \n\nWhile recent government funding, which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced last week, would be welcome in the battle to stop men’s violence, Ms Rees said the issue needed to be seen as a social problem, not a political one.\n\nShe said, given that 65 women had been killed by men in Australia so far this year, it was irrelevant whether cases of ­violence against women were becoming more or less common.\n\n“We can’t get those people back,” she said. “Someone said to me the other day: ‘If 65 blokes had been taken by sharks this year, we would have drained the ocean by now’. \n\n“We would have done something.”\n\nAnyone experiencing, or who knows someone being subjected to, violence or abuse should call police, Maitland Neighbourhood Centre manager Naomi Rees says. \n\nHer advice echoes the words of Central Hunter police commander Detective Superintendent Craig Jackson, who urged people last week to report all violence and abuse against women and children to police.\n\nMaitland police station can be contacted on 4934 0200.\n\nMaitland Mercury
0733_3b8c3174-97ed-4013-9cd0-056631d6a888	By Julian Reed Two weeks ago, a Judge ruled the process by which the NFL dolled out a Four game suspension to NFL Quarterback Tom Brady was (in a multitude of ways) unfair and unreasonable. This ruling negated the four game suspension and allowed for Brady to headline the NFL’s season opener in Foxboro as the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots took on the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Although the ruling is relevant on its own (given the air of scandal surrounding the story, and it’s nearly year long coverage), I look at it from a different perspective.  Though even a modest bit of reading into the NFL’s case in this matter would lead one to the conclusion that they lacked evidence, precedent and were simply using Brady to “set an example” for past well documented incidents where the league was heavily scrutinized for lenient punishments.  That ultimately wasn’t my biggest takeaway. My fascination with the case parallels my fascination with sports as a whole.  More specifically, how often high profile incidents devolve into pure tribalism and an “Us vs. Them” mentality.          Consuming sports and news, one gets the opportunity to view things through many different prisms. The opinions and feelings of traditional media types, ex players, fans, current players, owners of teams, etc.  What I found interesting with the Brady case, how many people very distinctly declared a side. Primarily, it involved two camps of people. Brady supporters, consisting of rabid Patriots fans and fans of other teams who were also Brady fans (They technically fall under the category of sympathizers, but we’ll let that part be removed from this discussion for now). The other, a combination of hardliners (Staunch NFL League office supporters) and Brady haters (Name says it all). Think of this conflict as sort of a poor man’s street brawl.  Take out the actual fighting, and intellectually, this is essentially what this incident (and all incidents) become. Typically, you declare allegiance emotionally to one of the aforementioned teams, and then proceed to use inflammatory disparaging and crude remarks towards the other factions. You’re yelling from the mountain top that Brady is innocent and an angel (Which if true, could’ve been an incredible meme. Pity.) or, that he’s the scum of the earth and a lying cheat who plays for a cheating organization.  Amidst this arbitrary back and forth dialogue, keep in mind, no one talks the actual particulars. This highlights the problem culturally.  Sadly, it all makes too much sense. Why would the masses deal in facts and reality when the grey area fueled by bias and emotion is so much more awesome and fun? There’s no fun and interesting in truth and objectivity often.  No guy or gal ever won a bar argument with “I think the NFL was brazen in their execution of discipline and investigation, despite the fact that Brady and the Patriots clearly know more than what they’re telling. That’s a moderate opinion, but it doesn’t move the needle quite like “Brady is Satan” or “Roger Goodell is a corporate pawn and corrupt.” The issue I take with this reality, it undermines actually reaching solutions because at no point is the actual problems of a situation ever even on the table. People tend to focus on blame and scrutiny. This does nothing for me.  Though I occasionally take amusement in watching the battle for Middle Earth essentially waged on the Internet and television every other week with our lust for scandal, I think it’s mostly a waste of time. My personal feelings about Tom Brady and the New England Patriots nor Roger Goodell and the NFL come into play in my overall opinion of the situation at hand. Unfortunately, it’s a much bigger issue than this. When I look at every major scandal of the sports world in the past few years, they all follow this tribalism style template. Whether it was the NFL Concussion Lawsuit, NFL/NHL lockouts, MLB steroids cases, Ray Rice domestic violence case, Michael Vick dogfighting scandal, LeBron’s “The Decision”, etc.  In every instance, the majority of people (fueled by emotion) picked a side and proceeded to equip armor to go to battle for that team. To get specific, there were actually (and still are) Ray Rice supporters. Some Ravens fans, some just men who wanted to advocate that a man should be able to hit a woman.  As a Ravens fan myself, this sickens me. Team affiliation in my opinion goes out the window (or should) once real world issues surface that have nothing to do with sports.  From the second I heard about what Ray Rice did to his then Fiancée, it was irrelevant whether or not he played for my team. Was fully a proponent of whatever punishment the team and NFL opted to hand down. Whether that be indefinite suspension, permanent NFL ban, etc. I’m in the very small minority on this, unfortunately. Most fans embody the definition of tribalism to the point that they defend any action deemed in the best interest of the team, and even sometimes fight and attack fans of other teams at games and on the Internet. This is normalcy in 2015, and widely considered the default connotation for what coincides with the modern fan experience. It’s a mentality of “all in” that you’ll hear mentioned often. For a lot of people, this is an accurate concept. The results it’s produced are scary to say the least.  Taking out the larger societal ills created when so much of people’s finite attention, emotion, and discretionary income is pumped into a feast or famine business like sports, I fear for the immediate future. More specifically, for the types of celebrities and star athletes we are creating. Criticism and scrutiny can be a difficult thing to deal with, but they serve an invaluable purpose in all facets of public life. The most effective way to convey what’s acceptable as a culture.  As sports became a big ticket item in the late 90’s, coupled with the rise of the Internet and celebrity worship, our ethos surrounding professional athletes and how we view and treat them has shifted exponentially. \nDespite the well documented sea of benefits, being a public figure is no easy task. Billions of people now have the power to pull up your salary, address, phone number, wife/husband/kids, etc in about 20 seconds of a Google search. With an extremely intense and shark infested pool of reporters and media outlets trying to get pictures of you and dig up past dirt, most celebrities opt for seclusion. Often, this creates an ecochamber. Most professional athletes tend to trust a small group of people, consisting of close family and friends, as well as a PR and brand management team, with agents and advisors. This makes it incredibly difficult to be able to convey most messages to them. As a society, when we want to indicate to a pro athlete that a deed they committed was wrong, it’s very difficult today to have that sink in. Of course, you can never know what’s in people’s hearts.  Despite that, it’s sometimes still important to set a standard that even the most famous and well known of our culture have to adhere to. After the Ray Rice incident, ideally it would’ve been great if society was in unison in our messaging that domestic violence is intolerable and has no place in the United States of America. And in some ways, we did. But, the timing of everything was botched to say the least.  It all began with two video tapes of the Rice incident released at different times by infamous news outlet TMZ. The first, released early in 2014 depicted Rice dragging his then unconscious fiancé from the elevator where he struck her in an Atlantic City Casino. The initial video didn’t spurn much public outcry. Rice during this time actually had many supporters. Some of them contested whether or not she began the confrontation and in turn asked through her actions to be knocked out cold (Ridiculous, I know). It wasn’t until the second video was released late in the summer by TMZ that the tanks of outrage stormed down the streets of New York to the NFL offices in search of retribution and answers.  The second video depicted what actually happened in the elevator. Rice and his fiancé were both drunk and were having an argument. Without warning, and unprovoked, Rice proceeded to punch her in the face, instantly knocking her out. This incident has become the face of domestic violence in America. Despite that, Rice at no point ever saw a jail cell, and got off. That’s not important here though. How this correlates to my broader point, like the Brady case, people picked sides rather than dealing with the issue. If Rice had chosen to be unapologetic and defiant, it would’ve been a lot easier to do so with the army of supporters he had behind him. What if no one supported him? A lot more difficult to be defiant without a built in support cushion.  Same goes for the Brady case. If it was actually about getting to the bottom of what happened, we could’ve resolved the issue in half the time that it took with Brady being defiant with fanbase backing. Whether it’s domestic violence, dogfighting, cheating, etc, I believe problems should remain at the forefront of discussions, rather than individuals. Individuals create emotion. Emotion is a deadly weapon in a logic based discussion.  Inevitably, individuals almost demand by human nature that you decide instantly whether you’re for or against. That easily can muddy a broader discussion because it brings in a bias that largely isn’t there otherwise.  You might despise cheating, but you’re much less likely to feel any emotion from the mention of it, without a situation or person attached to personalize/humanize it for you. In general, humans need to be able to put a face on things to be able to have empathy.  Dogfighting post Michael Vick is looked at markedly different. He will forever be the face of it. When the average person thinks of Dogfighting, they think Vick, and an image swirls in their head of his face, and the dogs he contributed to abusing and killing. Naturally, this generates a deep emotional feeling. As mentioned at the outset, I was never really interested in the Brady V NFL case. It involved a series of highly subjective and questionable events and opinions, bearing little substance.  Though a staunch advocate of fair play, you can’t punish what you can’t prove. While I acknowledge that the Patriots clearly did something, I also can acknowledge the NFL yet again handled an investigation and punishment process poorly and in turn, where reprimanded and (punishment) negated in court.  For fans and the public at large, I hope to see more people willing to get to solutions rather than exacerbating problems. Sports can be a wonderful outlet and beautiful entertainment medium. But, like we’re not perfect, they’re not perfect either.  It’s always important to remind ourselves of that. Hold people and businesses accountable, and uphold fair practice for the sake of all.
0734_3ab333ae-2c47-4ec9-bd06-43f345c49f0e	Lawmakers in the House are raising questions about U.S. rail security after a thwarted attack by a heavily armed gunman on a high-speed train in Europe. \n\nOn the same day three Americans who stopped a gunman on a train from Amsterdam to Paris were praised at the White House by President Obama, lawmakers questioned whether a similar incident could occur on a U.S. railway. \n\n"With the recent attempt by a terrorist on a high-speed rail in Europe to take multiple lives, we are more cognizant than ever of the vulnerability of our public transportation infrastructure," Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said during a House hearing on Thursday.  \n\n"Passengers were fortunate to have among them four brave Americans — including two members of America’s armed forces — who reacted swiftly and bravely to take down the Islamist extremist who, armed with a rifle and ample ammunition, intended to take as many innocent lives as possible that day," he continued. "But the odds are when the next would-be terrorist attacks passengers on a train or subway, the public may not be so fortunate as to have such capable and selfless persons on board and ready to react."  \n\nKing's comments came during a joint hearing of the the House's Transportation Security and Intelligence and Counterterrorism subcommittees that was called after the Paris rail attack in August.  \n\nThe attack on Paris commuter railway was thwarted by U.S. residents who were vacationing in Europe when they encountered the gunman on the train. The suspect, Moroccan citizen Ayoub El Khazzani, 26, had just fired upon a passenger and was attempting to use his AK-47. \n\nThe incident prompted lawmakers to call for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to boost its presence on U.S. railways, which the agency did just before the Labor Day holiday, when travel rates are high.  \n\nLawmakers said during the hearing this week that the same thing that draws passengers to train travel makes it attractive to potential terrorists.  \n\n"The easy access to rail transportation is one of the features that make it so popular," said King, who is chairman of the House Intelligence and Counterterrorism Subcommittee.  \n\n"Compared with air travel, most of us individually appreciate the relative ease of using subways like the Metro here in DC or MTA in New York, or commuter rail, such as the MARC train in Maryland or the Long Island Railroad," he continued. "Everyone values and enjoys simple and easy access. However, we have seen the vulnerability inherent in easy access in most mass transit services, including in attacks in London, Mumbai, Madrid, Tokyo, and now in Paris."  \n\nTSA officials told the panel that they work with officials from Amtrak and other domestic railways and transit systems to ensure that passengers are safe.  \n\n"On the passenger rail side, TSA and Amtrak partner on programs such as Regional Alliance Including Local, State and Federal Efforts (RAILSAFE) to deter terrorist activity through unpredictable security activities," TSA Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement Assistant Administrator Eddie Mayenschein told the panel in testimony submitted ahead of the hearing.  \n\n"This program also incorporates other rail, transit, and local law enforcement agencies and involves counterterrorism activities such as increased station and right of way patrols, greater security presence on trains and at stations, explosive detection sweeps using canine teams, and random passenger bag inspections," he continued.  \n\nAmtrak Police Chief Polly Hanson told lawmakers that the company maintains a large police force to deter potential terrorist attacks.  \n\n"The Amtrak Police Department consists of more than 500 members based in 30 locations," she said, though she admitted "it really wasn’t until after September 11 that counter-terrorism because a large focus of our security plans."  \n\nLawmakers said the Paris rail incident showed the need to do even more to prevent potential train attacks in the U.S.  \n\n"The heroic actions of those four men; Mark Moogalian, a teacher originally from Midlothian, VA; Anthony Sadler, a senior at Sacramento State University; Air Force Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone and Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Alek Skarlatos, saved countless lives," said Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.), the chairman of the House's Transportation Security Subcommittee.  \n\n"However, it is our responsibility to the American people to do all that we can to defend them against such heinous acts, and the American people should not be put in a position requiring them to defend their lives while riding a train, subway or bus to vacation, commute to work or simply run an errand," he continued.  
0735_f94a33e4-eec1-4968-8ff2-ed7b397bab0f	9th Time That Preliminary Injunction Has Been Challenged and Upheld \n \nNEW YORK -September 2, 2015- Vringo, Inc. ( NASDAQ: VRNG ), a company engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of intellectual property, today announced that, on August 31, 2015, the Bucharest Tribunal denied ZTE Romania's latest attempt to overturn Vringo's preliminary injunction against ZTE Romania.  \n    \nSince June 30, 2014, Vringo's preliminary injunction has restrained ZTE Romania from commercializing any 4G LTE mobile phone or infrastructure equipment manufactured by ZTE Corporation which incorporates 4G LTE technology. \n \nOn August 6, 2015, ZTE Romania filed a new motion, asking the court to revoke the preliminary injunction, and, as a subsequent request, to replace the preliminary injunction with a bond to be paid by ZTE Romania. ZTE Romania argued that (1) the preliminary injunction prevents ZTE Romania from honoring its binding contractual obligations, thereby triggering substantial damages, and (2) Vringo has not complied with the requirements set forth by the European Court of Justice in its Huawei v. ZTE decision, which was rendered on July 16, 2015.   \n \nOn August 31, 2015, the Bucharest Tribunal rejected all of ZTE Romania's arguments and denied ZTE Romania's request as ungrounded. This was ZTE Romania's ninth attempt to overturn and/or suspend the enforcement of the preliminary injunction since the preliminary injunction was granted on June 30, 2014. \n \nFollowing this latest rejection of ZTE Romania's attempt to overturn the preliminary injunction, ZTE Romania remains enjoined from commercializing any 4G LTE mobile phone or infrastructure equipment manufactured by ZTE Corporation which incorporates 4G LTE technology. \n \nAbout Vringo, Inc. \n \nVringo, Inc. is engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of intellectual property and mobile technologies.  Vringo's intellectual property portfolio consists of over 600 patents and patent applications covering telecom infrastructure, internet search, and mobile technologies.  The patents and patent applications have been developed internally, and acquired from third parties.  For more information, visit: www.vringo.com. \n \nForward-Looking Statements \n \nThis press release includes forward-looking statements, which may be identified by words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "should," "seeks," "future," "continue," or the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology.

0736_b87d6e79-fc3b-441b-a58e-7681bcd8eb00	If the sequester returns, the Army may not be able to respond to future, unforeseen threats, Army Secretary John McHugh asserted Tuesday. \n\nMcHugh argued that the ceilings on government spending put into place for a decade by the 2011 Budget Control Act are cramping the military, and that they should be lifted. \n\nMcHugh made his remarks during a conversation at the American Enterprise Institute about the future of the Army as he prepares to depart his role by November. \n\nThe Obama administration has called for ending the sequester. For the last two fiscal years, the Pentagon has had relief from the spending reductions because of a separate congressional spending bill, but the ceilings are set to return in fiscal year 2016. \n\n“If sequestration returns – any meaningful budget reduction in addition to that which we’re trying to manage right now – or that next unforeseen thing of any dimension comes forward, we’re in a very, very bad place,” McHugh said Tuesday. \n\n“I’ve testified, if either of those occur, let alone both, somebody’s going to have to tell us to stop doing something, and frankly as I look at the world right now, I’m not sure what that would be.” \n\nTo McHugh, the most important focus of the Army going forward will be readiness. Readiness, he said, includes modernization such as reactive armor, robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles and energy programs. \n\n“These are absolutely critical things no matter what the enemy may look like, whatever the enemy may come from,” he said. “So we try to be smarter. But our readiness continues to be a concern for me.” \n\nThe Army’s readiness stands at about 32 to 33 percent, McHugh said. That’s sustainable now, he said, but not likely into the future. \n\nOne difficulty in getting the necessary funding, McHugh said, is getting lawmakers outside of the House and Senate Armed Services committees to understand the Army’s needs. \n\n“We are very, very confident and comfortable with the posture of our oversight committees,” said McHugh. “If all we have to do was get our committees to act, whether it was repealing (the Budget Control Act) or some other measure, we’d be in far better shape. But that’s not how this democracy works.”

More than eight out of 10 fathers would like to spend time being the primary carer of their baby but only 2 per cent have actually done so, as men struggle to reconcile their role as family breadwinner with their desire to be hands-on dads.\n\nMonash University social work lecturer Samone McCurdy surveyed 950 fathers and 14 couples for her doctoral thesis to establish what prevents men from becoming primary carers and what would enable them to do so.\n\nIn findings that will be published next month, most men said they would like to take parental leave to look after their child for three months or more, so they can be an involved father and also so their partner can return to the workforce.\n\nMs McCurdy said the concept of fatherhood had changed. "Being a father is more than just earning money. They're expected to have relationships with their children directly, and not just through their wives."\n\nWomen's desire to continue their careers also influences men's desire to be the primary carer. "[Women] are more educated, they have careers, they're having babies later in life. They've built up a lot of social capital so there is a lot more at risk if they pull out of the workforce," Ms McCurdy said.\n\nWomen felt a lot more confident returning to work once their baby was six months old, if they knew the father was taking over as primary carer. Most fathers said they would quit their job to look after their baby if the alternative was placing them in formal childcare.\n\nBut while 85 per cent of men said they would like to spend at least three months as primary carers, they said their traditional status as the primary breadwinner inhibits their ability to do this. Just two per cent have actually taken leave to be the primary carer. Only one in ten fathers said they would act as primary carer if they were paid the federal minimum wage, which is what is provided under the Government's current paid parental leave scheme.\n\nMore than half of fathers said parental leave would have to be paid at replacement wage rates if they were to look after their child when the mother went back to work.\n\nIf they were paid a replacement wage, fathers said the ideal length of parental leave would be nine to 12 months. If they were paid the minimum wage, they would take just six weeks or less off work.\n\nThe acting chief executive of the Federal Workplace Gender Equality Agency, Louise McSorley​, said men needed more encouragement to take longer periods of parental leave. "Once they get over the financial barriers, they face systemic structural barriers that shut them out of being primary carers for their kids," she said.\n\nMs McCurdy said there wouldn't be true gender equality until society and employers perceived fathers to have the same caring responsibilities as mothers and expected all workers to take a period of leave to be the primary carer of their child.\n\n"The workplace has a critical role in deciding who stays at home and who goes to work, and for how long," she said. "If we really want gender equality to occur, we have to address that pipeline of care."\n\nWorkplace culture is the other impediment to men acting as primary carers. Just 16 per cent of fathers believe they are as accepted as carers as mothers are in the workplace. One man complained that when he returned to work from paternity leave, "it was as if I had just gone on holidays".\n\nMs McCurdy found that organisations made very few provisions for fathers to be primary carers. Fathers said their direct managers' attitude to parental care determined what leave they took, what flexible working arrangements they might be able to secure, and how it affected their career.\n\nMen feared that taking time off to be a primary carer could affect their prospects of a pay rise or promotion, as they were seen to be taking the "daddy track" and not serious about their career. Seeking part-time work was akin to signalling they were less committed to their job, while they couldn't even contemplate job-sharing.\n\nDAD AND PARTNER PAY\n\nThe taxpayer-funded dad and partner pay scheme has cemented employers' acceptance that fathers will take two weeks off work after the birth of their child.\n\nIntroduced in January 2013, the scheme provides most working fathers or partners with two weeks' leave paid at the minimum wage.\n\nAn independent evaluation of the scheme found DAPP had made fathers more resolute in insisting on their right to take parental leave around a birth, and had made workplaces more accepting of fathers taking that leave.\n\n"Overall it appears that DAPP has cemented a soft norm of fathers taking two weeks' leave around the time of a birth," the report said.\n\nHowever, it did not boost the proportion of fathers or partners who took leave when their baby was born. Only 36 per cent of those eligible, or more than 100,000 people, received the payment in its first year of operation.\n\nMen were more likely to take DAPP if they worked casually or were self-employed, worked in the public sector, knew other men who had taken parental leave, were older fathers or did not hold traditional gender role attitudes.\n\nDAPP did slightly increase the time new dads spent away from work in the first two months of their child's life, by one day to eleven days. It also saw fathers use DAPP instead of other paid leave, so they could retain that to use at a later date. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

The Fund discussed the general global market environment and the crisis in Greece. The Fund went on to talk about its strategy compared to Wall Street and retail investors who tend to buy and sell stocks with little regard for those companies' fundamentals. After discussing the global market and its investment strategy, the fund mentioned investment in its portfolio and the investment thesis for these positions. Olstein All Cap Value Fund Letter: Dear fellow shareholders: For the fiscal year ended June 30, Class C shares of the Olstein All Cap Value Fund appreciated 9.24%. During the same 12-month period, the Standard & Poor's 500® Index appreciated 7.42% and the Russell 3000® Index appreciated 7.29%. For the three-year period ended June 30, Class C shares of the Olstein All Cap Value Fund had an average annual return of 18.35% compared to annualized total returns of 17.31% for the Standard & Poor's 500® Index and 17.73% for the Russell 3000® Index. Market outlook The ongoing financial crisis in Greece, the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the expected negative impact of rising U.S. interest rates and a strengthening U.S. dollar caused an increase in market volatility during the first six months of 2015 fueling forecasters’ predictions of a market pullback. While there are always forecasters predicting the next market correction or downturn, we believe it is important for investors to weather market events and periods of short-term volatility by favoring the equities of financially strong companies with stable or growing free cash flow, run by managements that have a demonstrated history of deploying cash to the benefit of shareholders. In the current market, an enormous amount of investor money is flowing into high revenue growth companies with little, if any, free cash flow (e.g. Internet, social media, etc.). The money flowing into these high revenue growth companies is coming from the liquidation of industrial stocks that, in our opinion, are temporarily affected by a strong dollar and a less than robust economy (especially overseas), creating what we believe are deep discount stock purchase opportunities with free cash flow yields as high as 10%. In the current environment, there is a strong case for investing in equity securities of companies whose real economic value is unrecognized by the market, obscured by recent market uncertainty or overshadowed by temporary problems. We believe investors can find viable opportunities by focusing on four primary, company-specific factors: (1) a commitment to maintain a strong financial position as evidenced by a solid balance sheet; (2) an ability to generate sustainable free cash flow; (3) management that intelligently deploys cash balances and free cash flow from operations to increase returns to shareholders, and (4) a stock price that is at a discount to intrinsic value because of short-term factors. We further believe that, by prioritizing these factors, we are investing in companies that are positioned to compete more advantageously as economic growth accelerates. Our strategy There are times when the combination of certain events, such as the Greek financial crisis and slowdown in the Chinese economy, tend to overwhelm equity markets and hit a value-oriented portfolio, such as the Fund’s, particularly hard causing a period of short-term underperformance. At the same time, however, from our perspective as long-term value investors, the negative reaction during periods of increased market volatility creates many favorable opportunities for the Fund to buy good companies at bargain prices. Throughout the Fund’s history, Wall Street’s obsessive focus on short-term events and obsession with pouring money into “exciting in your face high growth companies” selling at prices and valuations that have already more than discounted the future growth (reducing the probability of future appreciation), often produced significant opportunities for the Fund to purchase stocks in under the radar with 8% to 10% free cash flow yielding companies being thrown out the window to raise money for the overvalued exciting companies. The Fund usually purchases what we believe are undervalued stocks selling at discounts to our calculation of intrinsic value, during periods of pessimism and underperformance by the company or industry that we deem to be temporary. Before purchasing, we conclude that the bargain prices are not warranted by our estimate of the company’s normalized ability to produce future free cash flow. Buying high growth companies at any price can reduce future returns. Although growth companies are exciting, the price you pay is critical. For example, the stock of the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is still not above its 1998 high stock price (when investors believed it was worth 95 times earnings based on assuming nonstop double digit growth forever). We believe we are currently in one of those periods with many investors buying and selling stocks with little regard for company fundamentals. We, on the other hand, continue to seek and invest in companies that we believe have an ability to deliver longterm value to their shareholders that, in many cases, is not currently recognized by the market. We remain focused on individual companies, their operations and prospects for maintaining or growing sustainable free cash flow. Patience is the most important virtue of a value investor. Forever is an overused word in our industry. Throughout our career, we have seen that whatever is working or not working over three- to six-month time periods, the word “forever” is usually attached. Rarely is “forever” true, but the word produces both overvalued and undervalued securities in most markets. Portfolio review The Fund’s current portfolio consists of companies that we believe have a sustainable competitive advantage, discernible balance sheet strength, a management team that emphasizes decisions based on cost of capital calculations and deploys free cash flow to create shareholder value and are selling at discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe companies with these characteristics are poised to eliminate the valuation gaps created by the recent events as the economic growth accelerates. At June 30, 2015, the Olstein All Cap Value Fund portfolio consisted of 103 holdings with an average weighted market capitalization of $57.57 billion. During the fiscal year, the Fund initiated positions in 30 companies and strategically added to positions in 27 companies. Over the same time period, the Fund eliminated its holdings in 32 companies and strategically decreased its holdings in another 12 companies. Positions initiated during the last 12 months include: Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), Brady Corporation (NYSE:BRC), Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG), Discovery Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:DISCK), Dorman Products (NASDAQ:DORM), Dover Corp. (NYSE:DOV), DSW Inc. (NYSE:DSW), First Niagara Financial Group (NASDAQ:FNFG), HCA Holdings Inc.

(MSM), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Oshkosh Truck Corp. (OSK), Owens-Illinois (OI), Packaging Corp. of America (PKG), Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO), Pentair Ltd.

(V) and Wendy’s Co. (WEN). Positions eliminated during the past twelve months include: 3M Co. (MMM), ABB Ltd. (ABB), American Express Company (AXP), Ann Inc. (ANN), Avery Dennison (AVY), Baxter International (BAX), CR Bard Inc. (BCR), CareFusion Corp. (CFN), Charles River Laboratories Inc. (CRL), Cintas Corp. (CTAS), Coca-Cola, Deere & Co.

(TJX), TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (TRW), URS Corp. (URS), VF Corp. (VFC), Walt Disney Company (DIS) and Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM). As previously discussed in shareholder letters for the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Fund eliminated its positions in CareFusion Corp., International Game Technology, PetSmart, Inc., TRW Automotive Holdings and URS Corp. on very favorable terms as these companies were targeted by strategic acquirers during the reporting period. Our leaders The stocks which contributed positively to performance for the 12-month reporting period include: Sealed Air Corp. (SEE), Universal Health Services, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) and Ross Stores. At the close of the fiscal year, the Fund continued to hold Sealed Air, Universal Health Services, UnitedHealth Group and Zoetis Inc. The Fund sold its position in Ross Stores, which it held for a couple of years as the price of the company’s stock reached our valuation level during the fourth quarter of 2014. Our laggards Laggards during the 12-month reporting period include: National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Fossil Group (FOSL), Now Inc., Vishay Intertechnology (VSH) and Wesco International (WCC). As of the close of the reporting period, the Fund continued to hold National Oilwell Varco, Fossil Group, Vishay Intertechnology and Wesco International in its portfolio. The Fund acquired the equity of NOW as a result of a spinoff from National Oilwell Varco in early June 2014 and held the company’s stock despite falling oil prices during the second half of 2014. The Fund liquidated its position in NOW in February as oil prices continued to fall and the outlook for oil remained uncertain.

0740_e9aead60-a72d-487f-8d08-835c702df2fe	By Ed Payne and Ashley Fantz CNN \n(CNN) -- He was a respected history professor who taught his favorite subject like it was front page news. \n\nShe was a loving mother who had a long-standing relationship with the man who ended her life. \n\nThey were victims, authorities say, of Shannon Lamb, a fellow professor at Delta State University in Mississippi, who fatally shot himself late Monday. \n\nEthan Schmidt was found dead early Monday morning in his office on the Cleveland, Mississippi, campus. He had been shot in the head. The 39-year-old was praised by university President William LaForge for his dedication to higher learning. \n\nWhen LaForge met the professor a few years ago, he mistook Schmidt for a student. "He is youthful in his appearance," LaForge recalled after a very long and agonizing day that brought terror to the small college campus as police spent hours hunting Schmidt's killer, locking down buildings and advising everyone to avoid windows just in case. \n\nAt a midnight news conference, a weary LaForge assured that the campus was safe. By then, Lamb had shot himself in the woods near Greenville, Mississippi. \n\nLaForge remembered Schmidt as someone who "advised a ton of students." \n\nHe recently took over a first-year seminar program that helped students acclimate to college life. \n\n"He was a star on our faculty," LaForge said. \n\nA mother who lived with Lamb \n\nBefore killing Schmidt, authorities say, Lamb killed his own girlfriend, Amy Prentiss, in Gautier, Mississippi, about 300 miles from Cleveland. \n\nPrentiss lived on the state's coast on and off for years, according to the Sun-Herald newspaper. \n\n"She always wanted to help other people," close friend Lindsay Knowles told the newspaper. \n\nPrentiss and Lamb lived together and had been dating for about three years, Knowles said, telling the newspaper that her friend had told her about fights the couple had. Knowles said that Prentiss did not say those arguments were violent. \n\nLamb was a singer and Knowles said Prentiss' teenage daughter sang backup for the alleged killer during a recent performance at a club in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. \n\nPrentiss' LinkedIn page says she was a manager for her daughter Abigail Osteen. \n\nA lot of Prentiss' life revolved around her daughter and the girl's singing career, Knowles told the newspaper. \n\nPrentiss worked at home doing an online job, Knowles said, with her hound dog Lightning keeping her company. \n\nShe was also very involved with Oasis Church, her friend told the paper. \n\nPastor Eric Camp urged on Facebook for everyone to pray for Prentiss' family and for her daughter. \n\n"Please pray for everyone affected by this tragedy and pray justice for the one responsible," he wrote. \n\nStudent body president in college \n\nSchmidt's college career started at Emporia State. He earned a bachelor's and master's in history at the Kansas school in 1998 and 2001, but he wasn't just tucked away in the history department. \n\nHe served as student body president and was named a distinguished senior by the university. He was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity and two honor societies. \n\nA former professor gushed. \n\n"He was a remarkable student," said Karen Manners Smith, a professor of history. "He was one of the best students I ever had and I was thrilled he went on to a career in teaching history." \n\n"He was on his road to being one of the great scholars of American history," she said. \n\nAn outstanding teacher \n\nWord of his death hit hard at Texas Tech, where Schmidt moved after earning his doctorate in U.S. history at the University of Kansas in 2007. \n\n"He was an outstanding teacher, scholar and friend. Even more importantly, he was an incredible husband and father," Tech history chair Sean Cunningham said on the school's Facebook page. "We are simply crushed." \n\nSchmidt taught graduate and undergrad courses, focusing on American history and especially the history of Native Americans in the United States. \n\nHe won an Innovative Teaching Award in 2010 and the President's Award for Excellence in Teaching a year later. \n\nSchmidt's career reached a new level when he arrived at Delta State in 2013 as an assistant professor of American history. \n\nEarly America continued to fascinate him, especially the interaction between the European colonists and the indigenous people of North America. \n\nHis research won him praise from his colleagues. He published two books and contributed articles to other publications. \n\n"He did a tremendous job as a history professor," said LaForge. "I thought the world of him. He was a star on our faculty at Delta State." \n\nStudent outpouring \n\nPerhaps Schmidt can be best judged by the students he taught and the impressions he made. \n\nFormer students filled Facebook and Twitter with their memories of the man who made history come alive for them. \n\n"What a tragedy! I took Dr. Schmidt's American history course as a freshman in 2008. It was one of my favorite college classes during my time at Texas Tech (I was a molecular bio major)," said Joe Herbert. "He had an amazing way of telling the story of history in a way that was at once engaging and informative." \n\n"One of my favorite graduate history classes was with Dr. Schmidt," said Kylie Schaefer. "So saddened by his news." \n\nAnd from Amanda Wolfe: "He was the best history teacher, ever! My prayers go out to his family and children whom he spoke highly of, always. We will miss you Schmidt!" \n\nCNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report. \n\nTM & © 2015 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

0743_8dcaf391-5ea6-41bb-9c31-32ee78b86696	Two story lines about Pope Francis' politics have competed for airtime during his visit to the U.S. this week. Is he the "progressive pope," a champion of the Democratic Party's agenda, or is he a spokesman for universal values that transcend our tedious political divisions? The answer contained in his address to Congress is: He's both. \n\nAside from a line about how the Golden Rule requires the protection of human life at all stages of development, and a veiled reference to his opposition to same-sex marriage, Pope Francis said nothing that would discomfit a progressive (at least one who can put up with a lot of mentions of God). He called on Americans to be generous to immigrants, to abolish the death penalty, to fight poverty and hunger "constantly and on many fronts," and to protect the environment. These are, of course, goals that are more often associated with the American left than with its right, and so Francis' words carry more of a challenge to Republicans than to Democrats. \n\nBut the pope's argument was couched in terms that appeal to Americans of all political persuasions. There was no pointed rebuke of those who oppose particular climate change policies or immigration initiatives. The only specific policy Francis endorsed was abolishing capital punishment. Liberals can easily make the case that their policies flow naturally from the values the pope invoked in his speech. But most conservatives accept those values too, and those conservatives who listened to the speech with an open mind can make the case that they have a superior understanding of how to act on them. \n\nThose of us on the right could enthusiastically agree with Francis, for example, that people who seek to come to this country are often "in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones," and should be treated in a "just and fraternal" way. But we might also note that these newcomers are more likely to succeed here, and integrate into our country, if we limit their number and especially the number who come or extend their stays illegally . \n\nFighting poverty, as the pope said, requires that we first create wealth, which adds to the moral case for pro-growth policies. Increasingly, conservatives such as Congressman Paul Ryan are focusing on other ways to increase opportunity for the poor: expanding school choice, changing aid programs so they don't inadvertently punish people for getting ahead, breaking down licensing rules that keep people from pursuing their dreams. \n\nPope Francis said we need to "avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity," and called on "America's outstanding academic and research institutions," in particular, to contribute to this task. A conservative approach to global warming should take roughly that tack: promoting research on how to mitigate its risks . \n\nWhat the pope said about all these issues is right: We do have duties to help our neighbors, relieve poverty and take care of the Earth. There's no denying that his words posed a challenge to conservatives. But it's a challenge conservatives can and should meet. \n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. \n\nTo contact the author of this story: \n Ramesh Ponnuru at rponnuru@bloomberg.net \n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: \n Timothy Lavin at tlavin1@bloomberg.net

0745_fc24548f-342c-4401-afd6-1005f425c65d	RALEIGH, N.C. — More than 30 magistrates in North Carolina have refused to perform weddings since a law went into effect allowing officials to refrain from conducting marriage-related activities. \n \nThe state court system says it's received notices from nearly 5 percent of the state's 670 magistrates since a law took effect in June allowing them to opt out of performing all marriages. The law exempts court officials with a "sincerely held religious objection" and is designed for those opposing gay marriage. Only Utah has a similar recusal law. \n \nThe North Carolina law also applies to some register of deeds workers. Elected officials would perform the duties as a last resort. \n \nState Sen. Phil Berger, who sponsored the law, said it is probably preventing situations like the one in Kentucky, where a clerk has refused to issue licenses since the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in late June legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. The Kentucky clerk, Kim Davis, was ordered to jail Thursday for contempt. \n \n"It's keeping folks from having to choose between their jobs and their religious beliefs," said Berger, a Republican from Rockingham County. "I think that's important." \n \nThe law took effect June 11, when the veto of GOP Gov. Pat McCrory was overridden by the General Assembly. \n \nThe North Carolina law exempts magistrates and assistant and deputy register of deeds workers from carrying out all marriage ceremonies — gay and heterosexual couples — for at least six months when they notify their bosses of the religious objection. Register of deeds issue marriage licenses, while magistrates have authority to officiate marriages. \n \nThe chief District Court judge or the county register of deeds — both elected officials — would carry out marriage transactions if no one else was available. Magistrates from elsewhere willing to marry gay couples would be brought in if all area magistrates recused themselves. \n \nCounty register of deeds offices reported about a dozen recusals shortly after the law took effect, according to the North Carolina Association of Registers of Deeds. \n \nThe Administrative Office of the Courts won't identify the 32 magistrates who have filed notices of recusal or where they work, saying that personnel information is confidential under state law. \n \nNorth Carolina gay rights and civil liberties groups have been urging couples who are denied a marriage license under the law to contact their offices. It could form the basis of litigation to challenge the law. No lawsuits have yet been filed. \n \nSarah Preston with the American Civil Liberties Union in North Carolina said in a release while it was troubling to hear that government officials would refuse to perform a part of their job, "it's clear that the vast majority of magistrates are more than willing to serve all members of the public fairly and equally."
0746_41468f05-8351-4dd1-b442-ce10ee92cae5	Nearly four years after dozens of black-clad police rappelled into his New Zealand mansion and cut him from a safe room, flamboyant German tech entrepreneur and would-be hip-hop star Kim Dotcom may finally be about to face the music.\n\nA New Zealand court hearing starting on Monday will determine whether Dotcom will face charges of copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering in the United States related to the Megaupload file-sharing site he founded in 2005.\n\nWell known for his hip-hop inspired photo shoots with scantily clad women and luxury cars, Dotcom had assets including computers, art works, a pink Cadillac and bank accounts holding millions of dollars frozen after the 2012 raid in the hills outside Auckland.\n\nUS authorities say Dotcom and three co-accused Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $US500 million and generated more than $US175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, such as movies and TV shows.\n\n"The US ... took down the entire Megaupload site, went ahead and froze all their assets and did this with great publicity and public fanfare and did it in co-ordination with the very powerful force in the United States, from Hollywood," Dotcom's lawyer, Ira Rothken, said.\n\n"We feel as though Kim Dotcom ... will not have a fair procedural playing field because he won't have any assets with which to mount a defence for the largest copyright case in history."\n\nThumbing his nose at US authorities, Dotcom set up a new cloud storage company call Mega after being bailed, but has since distanced himself from the business. Monday's hearing will be watched by developers like Dotcom working in the grey areas of the law prevalent at the internet's cutting edge for signs of how far Washington is willing to go to protect US copyright holders, said Tom Pullar-Strecker, who covers technology for Fairfax Media in New Zealand\n\n"You just have to look at what the US has achieved already through this action. Kim Dotcom's business, Megaupload, has been destroyed really through simply taking the action," he said.\n\n"It had an immediate chilling effect."\n\nMegaupload accounted for about 4 per cent of total traffic on the internet in its heyday as users stored and shared files containing everything from wedding videos to Hollywood films.\n\nSince his arrest, Dotcom, a German national and New Zealand resident, has been barred from leaving the country or venturing more than 80 kilometres from his mansion, and is required to report to police twice a week.\n\nThe prosecution must prove that a crime was committed in both the United States and New Zealand in order to trigger an extradition treaty between the allies.\n\nIn an opinion submitted in support of Dotcom, Harvard law professor and copyright expert Lawrence Lessig argued that Washington's case does not meet those requirements.\n\n"An attempt has been made to extract facts from multiple sources and over a wide span of time, to organise a large number of otherwise disconnected facts by using systematic phraseology and to juxtapose phrases in order to create an impression of coherence and substance," Lessig wrote.\n\n"However, the attempt fails to reach its goals."\n\nA spokeswoman for the New Zealand Crown Law service declined to comment.
0747_13d3ae98-620a-4862-9790-f29c07a58ed0	The UN Secretary -General's Special Envoy on Ebola, Dr. David Nabarro, has emphasized the need for the international community to remain fully engaged in its support to boost Liberia's recovery efforts. He also praised the Liberian Government's efforts in tackling the Ebola virus as the country has been re-declared Ebola free. \n\nNabarro said particular attention should be paid to key areas such as food security, health systems, and non-Ebola related health services. \n\nThe UN Envoy made the observation when he addressed the business community recently at the US- Liberia Trade and Investment Forum which took place in New York. \n\nHe said that the momentum built during the International Ebola Recovery Conference recently, which generated tremendous international support for national recovery plans of the affected countries should be taken forward. \n\n"There is a need to build up the public health systems and improve primary care in Liberia and the region. Ebola exploits fragile and overstretched health systems with limited public health capabilities. Therefore, we must prioritize strengthening the health institutions, develop their infrastructure and support the training of the necessary personnel," said the UN Envoy. \n\nDr. Nabarro, who has worked for over 15 years with the World Health Organization and in the UN Secretariat respectively, said the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest and most complex epidemic, posing challenges of epic proportions to the region and the global community. \n\nHe, however, acknowledged that there has been significant progress to end the Ebola outbreak, but was quick to stress that getting to and staying at zero remains a challenge in the other affected countries.
0748_54dd1820-d078-47d7-a265-6e41bcdef141	LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/11/15 -- . (OTCBB: UCLE) announced that it has received $118,000 in the first phase of purchase orders to build radiation in-water monitoring equipment for a South Korean environmental protection agency and research institute. "Detecting radiation in-water, real-time and continuously, is one of our specialties. This is a very exciting opportunity for us to build one of our unique systems aimed to protect the environment and population against potential radiation exposure," commented Robert I. Goldstein, President, CEO and Chairman. \n\nIt is well known in the industry that detecting radiation in-water in a flow-through, continuous system is a formidable and sophisticated task; there are only a few companies worldwide engaged in such production due to the complexity involved. US Nuclear Corp. specializes in this technology by offering the only commercial real-time alpha, beta (including C-14 and tritium), and gamma in-water monitors in the world. Furthermore, this equipment produces no waste stream and requires no reagents to operate. \n\nWater quality in terms of radioactivity is most often determined passively, by taking discreet samples that are then sent to a lab for analysis. However, this method can be time-consuming, inefficient, and most importantly, it does not provide a real-time indication. Mr. Goldstein further stated, " If an accidental spill/leak, or deliberate dumping (by terrorist act or illegal disposal) of highly concentrated radioactive material were to enter the water source, it may not be known for days, weeks, or even months later, when the sample is finally analyzed. US Nuclear Corp. realized the problem and danger associated with this and developed an automated radiation in-water monitor, designed to detect at or below DHS (Department of Homeland Security) and EPA-PAG (Environmental Protection Agency) level guidelines for drinking water quality, providing real-time data and alerts to the population." \n\nThis order represents only the first phase of development, and additional detection sub-assemblies to be ordered and added to the system in the near future. \n\nAbout US Nuclear Corp. \n\nUS Nuclear Corp. is a fully reporting, publicly traded company on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, traded under the ticker symbol UCLE. The Company's operations are principally engaged through its subsidiaries, operating two leading nuclear radiation detection companies, Overhoff Technology Corp. and Optron Scientific Company Inc. The Company designs, manufactures and markets branded, full line radiation detection and specialized advanced tritium technology for the nuclear energy industry and for emerging technological processes such as Thorium and Molten Salt (MSR) reactor technologies both domestically and internationally, to customers such as United States Government Agencies, the U.S. Military, Homeland Security, scientific laboratories, universities, hospitals, nuclear reactor facilities in the United States, China, Canada, South Korea, Argentina, Russia and others. \n\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \n\nThis release contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

0750_8d9e3e8d-8461-4b62-9631-76a2b39ea12f	Below $2 gasoline has many people thrilled and many others fearful for their jobs, because they could be joining the hundreds of others in Texoma who have already been laid off from energy related jobs. \n\nTexas-based ConocoPhillips announced earlier this month that they would be laying off 10% of their global workforce, and Haliburton also recently announced they would be letting thousands of people go. \n\n"My husband is in the oil field industry and when the gas prices are low that's obviously bad for our economy and our paychecks, our family," Wichita Falls resident Christina Crafton said. \n\nCrafton says her husband  works for Texas Energy and  has already taken a pay cut because of the low prices. \n\n"He took a pay cut back in December. They took 10% pay cut and if you didn't get a pay cut you were laid off," Crafton said. \n\nOfficials with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers say it starts with the price of crude oil, which went from $100 a barrel all the way down to only $40 a barrel in less than a year. \n\n"Until we get supply and demand back into kilter, you're going to continue to see a downward cycle in the oil and gas industry," Texas Alliance of Energy Producers Alex Mills says. \n\nMills thinks even more jobs will be lost because of the current over-supply of oil and gas. \n\n"It's a volital business that we're in and it goes up and down on a daily basis," Mills said. \n\nThat has those who work in the industry, like Crafton's husband, worried but hoping things will change. \n\n"It's not going back up. He watches it and it just fluctuates a couple dollars up, down two or three the next day. So, it's not good," Crafton said. \n\nThe average price of regular gas in Wichita Falls right now is about $1.99 a gallon, Mills expects that to drop a few cents more over the next few months.
0751_d23c1178-a770-4b12-8d45-ca423ce8cb41	A gang of "evil" paedophiles who raped babies, toddlers and pre-school children in abuse that was streamed over the internet have been jailed. \n \nThe men, described as "beyond human instinct", preyed on the families of youngsters to gain access to them, in once case grooming a mother and father before their baby's birth. \n \nMembers travelled hundreds of miles to carry out attacks together, or used internet streaming to provide real-time encouragement and directions to those abusing victims. \n \nChat logs revealed the gang would offer advice on using "date rape" drugs or over-the-counter medication to drowse children and babies. \n \nThe seven men, aged between 31 and 51, were convicted of 29 child sex abuse offences, including the multiple rape of an 11-month-old baby. \n \nThey are John Denham, 50, from Wiltshire, Matthew Stansfield, 35, from Hampshire, Adam Toms, 33, from Somerset, Christopher Knight, 35, from Manchester, Robin Hollyson, 31, from Bedfordshire, David Harsley, 51, from Yorkshire, and Matthew Lisk, 33, from Sussex. \n \nJudge Julian Lambert jailed the men, including two who are HIV positive, to terms ranging from two to 24 years and ordered all but one to register as sex offenders for life. \n   Promoted stories   \n"In the worst nightmare, from the very deepest recesses of the mind, at the darkest hour of the night, few can have imagined the terrifying depravity which you men admit," the judge said at Bristol Crown Court. \n \n"What you contemplated and what you did involved the most horrific abuse of a baby and very young children. \n \n"Your thoughts and deeds are beyond human instinct and reason, and are evil beyond rational understanding." \n \nHe said the men had sought out the "darkest materials on the internet" and planned "the most shockingly sordid exploitation of the very young". \n \nThe National Crime Agency launched an investigation last September after Toms admitted to police that he had abused a child. \n \nHe provided the details of 40 others involved and officers began the painstaking process of gathering evidence from fragments of deleted files and chat room logs. \n \nThree victims - a baby and two four-year-old boys who live in different parts in the country - were identified, while 30 other children were safeguarded. \n \nFurther prosecutions are expected. \n \nMembers used Skype, video conferencing software and the "dark web" to coordinate and view the attacks. \n \nUp to 25 men joined each session, which included watching a 17-year-old boy abuse his four-year-old brother in America. \n \nHollyson gained "access" - a phrase used by the men - to a baby in 2013 and boasted of repeatedly raping the boy from the age of three months. \n \nHe filmed himself doing so between December 2013 and January 2014. \n \nIn May 2014, Hollyson, Stansfield and Toms took turns to rape and sexually assault the baby while sharing footage online. \n \nVideo clips from July 2014 show Hollyson further abusing the boy. \n \nThe infant was posed in photographs advertising the chat room where his abuse would be streamed. \n \nIn April 2014, Toms administered drugs to a four-year-old boy so he and Knight could abuse him, with photographs of the incident shared online. \n \nMany of the defendants also possessed some of the worst child images imaginable, Judge Lambert said. \n \nHollyson was jailed for 24 years, Toms for 12, Knight for 18, Stansfield for 10, Denham for eight, Lisk for four and Harsley for two years. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nAll but Harsley were handed extended sentences and placed on the sex offenders' register for life. \n \nOne of the victim's families said: "No family ever wants to find that their child has been the victim of abuse, nor would they ever knowingly put their child at risk."

0754_4a3238dc-5e93-4847-a258-8a73b079c302	Advertisement\nEurope » Greece\nSeptember 28th 2015 Published: September 28th 2015EDIT THIS ENTRY\nNZ4ME\nThursday, August 10 - It's time to leave Skopelos; we've been on the island for eight days and have done all we need to do. It's 3.30pm and time for the ferry back to Volos, where we are scheduled to spend the night, then pickup a rental car and drive to Mt Olympus. Of course, in Greece, all is not as easy as it seems. A ferry with a different name appears at the scheduled time, so we ask a female purser, who replies “ you catch next ferry”. Not feeling comfortable with this answer Caroline asks a harbor policeman, and he replies “this is the last ferry for the day”. Oops! I haven't seen Caroline move so fast in a long time, she runs over to the travel agent to get new tickets issued. Yes, we catch the ferry, but are the last passengers up the gangplank. Then we try to pick up our car; again it's a little third world-y, the address is for a car rental company, but no one knows of our booking, a phone call is made to a third party and the car arrives. I think this guy just rents out his personal car, but Gods, taken on Mt Olympuswe have one and we will drop it in Athens at a specific time on Sept 25. Friday - On to Mt Olympus, around 2 hours from Volos and as we ascend the mountain to see a traditional Greek Village, I spy a tortoise attempting to cross the road. This looks like a potential crushed reptile to me, so we stop the car in a safe place and run back and take the creature to safety. This act must get me points with the Gods. The traditional village is picturesque, and as we continue on up the mountain wen are drawn by signs of “old style hotel”. Yes, it was a traditional hotel and we had thoughts of a “Greek Shining” as we entered. Coffee was good and thick and when we leave we notice numerous rabbits in cages, presumably to be served on the menu at some future date. Mt Olympus has nine peaks and we have driven a road up one of them, there is still time to explore some more as it is only 2.30pm. The second road leads to the Monastery of Agios Dionysis and to the National Park. The monastery is in a state of disrepair and is slowly being rebuilt. It seems that it had been destroyed by the Germans in World War II. These monks didn't get any of the missing EU money. We spend the night in beach hotel around 30km from Mt Olympus. An interesting factoid, this area, Olympus Beach, is a lot cheaper than the islands and seems to be the vacation destination of Eastern Europeans, I try to ask a travel agent a question and I am asked whether I speak Romanian or Polski! Saturday – Before leaving the area we visit the Archaeological park of Dion. When we arrive there are no tourists and we wander through the ruins on our own. The city housed around 10,000 and dated back to the 5th century BC. Then, a 3 ½ hour drive to Meteora and as Caroline navigates me through a small town with narrow streets I almost take the wing mirror off a police car. The policeman is less than happy and gives me an ear bashing in Greek, I'm just glad I didn't understand a word he was saying. Finally, we arrive in Mt Olympus and MeMeteora and it's breathtaking, a forest of rock with monasteries perched precariously on the top. Our hotel is comfortable, especially after we are talked into upgrading to a suite. We visit one of the Monasteries, in fact it is really a nunnery, St Stephens was used in the Bond movie, For Your Eyes Only. This is the only easily accessible where instead of steps you cross a small bridge to enter. I'm sure Caroline has her eyes closed as we walk over the small bridge into the Monastery. Sunday- Leave the hotel around 8.45 with the intention of visiting Mega Meteora, but when we arrive the hordes of tourists are swarming like cockroaches from the waiting coaches and there is no place to park. Decision made, I visit 2, the least touristy (while Caroline hangs out below), Varlaam and Agios Nikolaos ( this second one holds 16 century Frescoes done by the pre-eminent artist at the time) and I climb lots and lots of steps...... In the afternoon, a visit to Theopetra Cave where ancient man survived 23,000 years ago. Unfortunately, no cave paintings. Monday, 14th Sept. - It's back on the road and heading for the west coast of Greece and the Ionian Sea. We are due to spend a week on Kefalonia with old friends Jane and Mike Alexander, but first it's a five hour drive to Vasiliki, overnight in Vasiliki, and then a ferry crossing the following day. Along the way we find out where some of the EU money went. A large complex of tunnels running through the mountains to link the center of Greece, Larisa with the east coast. Some of the tunnels are over 8km in length and to my mind outshine the tunnels linking France and Italy. Amazing, and as always the posted signs are totally ignored by Greek drivers, if it's posted at 80km, they are not happy unless they can double the speed. Our hotel in Vasiliki is very nice, but we could hear every little sound in the hotel. Not good for bickering! Tuesday 15 Sept thru 22 Sept - I had concern about taking my rental car on the ferry, research on Google seemed to infer that taking rental cars on My favorite Monastery Photoferries in Greece wasn't allowed. So when I picked the car up in Volos, I mentioned we were going to Kefalonia 3 times. The guy renting the car didn't flinch, so the last hurdle was actually getting on the ferry, and apart from having to back the car on, no problem. We disembarked in Fiscarado and immediately left town looking for our villa in Agia Effimia. Having located the villa, 4kms from Agia Effimia, we picked our bedroom and settled in for a glorious week. Jane and Mike arrived the following day and from then on it was eating, drinking and laughing. Most days included a swim in the clear,warm waters of the Mediterranean, and one day we even hired a power boat with a 30hp motor to explore the bays only accessible by boat, good fun. Every night a different taverna and finally before leaving the island we visited Captain Correli's beach. Yes, a totally relaxing week with good friends. Tuesday, 22nd Sept. - Back on a ferry to the mainland followed by a five hour drive to Delphi, spiritual world of the Ancient Greeks. On the side of a mountain, terraces hold the remains of a large temple complex to the Ancient Gods. We visited in the late afternoon with few tourists and this was exceptional, great light and lots of photos. I'm always amazed that the remains of buildings from 2500 years ago still exist. In the evening, I picked the worst restaurant we have had the misfortune to have a meal at. Ugh! Wednesday, another wild ride, but this time we were in the car for only 4 hours. And along the way we managed to glimpse the old harbor of Lepanto off which there was a great sea battle in 1571 where the Catholic forces decisively won a victory over the Ottoman Empire. Our final destination was three hours further on through the mountains of the Peloponnese, Ancient Olympia. This is the birthplace of the Olympic Games and the site where the Olympic torch is still lit! This is quite a complex, built on the flat, for the athletes, dignitaries, spectators and officials. And in the center of all this was a temple about 13 meters high housing a 6 meter statue of the God Zeus. Boating in Kefalonia\nThursday, Sept. 24 - Back in the car and three hours on treacherous mountain roads to Argos and Mycenae. An afternoon visit to the port city of Nafplia, which is overlooked by a 15 century Venetian castle. The Venetians had a stranglehold on Greece from the 14th to 18th Century. It is a common sight to see Venetian Castles overlooking the sea on the islands and mainland Greece. Friday, Sept 25 – Up early to walk through the ruins of ancient Mycenae, a city built on a hill and dating from round 1600BC through to 1100BC. A biggie being the Lion Gate, yes took the picture and walked around the site. It's amazing to think how progressive these people were in their building and art work. A quick glimpse of the Corinth canal on the way back to Athens. And finally the moment I had been dreading, the delivery of the car into central Athens. However, having Caroline on the GPS navigating me down narrow streets actually managed to get me to the drop off address without loosing my cool! Motorbikes, scooters, cars and people appear from everywhere and as signage isn't always the best, you sometimes don't know who has the right of way. Defensive driving is name of the game in Greece, full stop! Saturday 26 Sept thru 29 Sept. - Our first view of the island is high cliffs with white on top and white dribbling down the sides. Santorini, what can I say, amazingly beautiful, expensive, and the in-place for Chinese and Japanese weddings. Last but not least, hordes of tourists come in every day. We are staying in Angel Cave Houses in Oia, and it's worth the effort and money to find somewhere on the side of the cliff overlooking the caldera. This island is a photographers dream - blue doors, blue domes and white dwellings. And to keep Caroline happy there is an archaeological site, Akrotiri, dating back to 1700BC before the eruption that destroyed Knossos. Supposedly, this is the biggest eruption that mankind has ever seen and maybe even the force that wiped out “Atlantis”. Tuesday, 29 Sept. - Back to Athens for two nights and then home to New Zealand Pork Souvlaki on the hoof\nPet hates: Greek Drivers, don't obey signage whether it's stop or speed Motorcylists with helmets hanging off their arm. The law says you must wear a helmet, but doesn't specify that it should be on your head. Greasy food, there's a reason it's called Greece! Steep mountain roads where cars in opposite directions have centimeters to spare as they pass. Driving in Athens. Ouzo, I drank too much one night. Zorba's Dance, it's a bit like El Condor Pasa in Peru, played everywhere. I love: The price of beer and wine The history, it oozes from every rock, cliff The islands The warm clear Mediterranean Cheap accommodation The friendliness of the Greeks, except when behind the wheel Tavernas Ferries The Tunnel Systems And even though they are economically in the poo they approach each day positively.\nAdditional photos below\nPhotos: 37, Displayed: 29 « Back 12Next »\nAdvertisement

0756_debe7bdd-1ee7-49d8-be98-d9aeacacf459	The latest news on the scandal over Volkswagen's evasion of U.S. emissions controls. All times local. \n\n--- \n\n3:20 p.m. \n\nProsecutors in Germany say they are considering whether to open an investigation into the Volkswagen emissions scandal. \n\nThe prosecutors' office in Braunschweig, near VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, says Wednesday that it is considering opening an investigation against employees of VW who might be responsible. It didn't specify any names, and no one has yet been identified as being to blame for the manipulation of software in diesel vehicles. \n\nProsecutors say they are collecting information after receiving "several" criminal complaints. Anyone can file a criminal complaint in Germany, and prosecutors have to examine whether to act on them. \n\nLower Saxony state's justice ministry says it couldn't give any information on the number or contents of the complaints. \n\n--- \n\n1:15 p.m. \n\nEconomists are beginning to voice some worries over the impact on German growth from the Volkswagen crisis. \n\nCarsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said the ongoing refugee crisis and now the "Volkswagen shocker" pose new risks to the German economy. \n\nBrzeski concedes that it is "unclear" what the impact of the VW crisis will be, but that there will likely be one given the size of VW. It is, he notes, "one of Germany's most important global champions" and an "important growth driver for the German economy." \n\nAnd Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said the Volkswagen scandal is a new risk to German growth to go alongside the slowdown in China. \n\nIn the second quarter, Germany grew by a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent. \n\n--- \n\n1:10 p.m \n\nGermany's transport minister says it remains to be seen what effect the suspect software built into some 11 million Volkswagen diesel vehicles actually had. \n\nMinister Alexander Dobrindt has set up a commission to examine whether the cars were built and examined in compliance with German and European rules. \n\nHe said Wednesday that Volkswagen has indicated the software was inactive, and that the commission will have to "examine carefully what changes an inactive part could cause to an engine, the vehicle." \n\nHe said that only then would it be possible to decide what happens with the cars affected. \n\nDobrindt wouldn't say whether he expects heads to roll at Volkswagen. He said his job is to examine how consumers might have been affected and "it is not for us to decide on other questions." \n\n--- \n\n1:00 p.m. \n\nVolkswagen's share price has rallied further but still remains around a third lower than it was at the start of the week. \n\nIn early afternoon trading in Frankfurt, the company's share price was up 3.1 percent at 114.60 euros. That's a marked turnaround from the start of the session when it slid a further 7 percent to trade below 100 euros for the first time in nearly four years. \n\nWednesday's rise follows declines of 17 percent and 20 percent in the first two days of the week that saw nearly 25 billion euros (around $28 billion) wiped off the company's market value. \n\nDavid Madden, market analyst at IG, said the sector as a whole is one "to swerve until there is a conclusion to this saga." \n\n--- \n\n12:35 p.m. \n\nThe head of Germany's main industry lobby organization is calling for "transparency, openness and speed" in getting to the bottom of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. \n\nUlrich Grillo of the Federation of German Industries said in a statement Wednesday that "'made in Germany' stands for excellent products." \n\nGerman engineering and German craftsmanship are "rightly respected worldwide," he added. \n\nGrillo says his organization "strongly criticizes any manipulation." \n\nHe said of the Volkswagen scandal that "any misconduct must be cleared up completely." \n\n--- \n\n12:25 p.m. \n\nSeveral law firms are filing class action lawsuits against Volkswagen over its admission that it used special software to get its cars to pass U.S. emissions tests. \n\nClifford Law Offices, based in Chicago, says it is filing a complaint to the Northern District of Illinois alleging that VW engaged in deceptive and fraudulent business practices. \n\nMeanwhile, law firm Sutts, Strosberg LLP, based in Windsor, Canada, was reported in local media to have filed a class action lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages and $100 million in punitive damages. \n\n--- \n\n11:45 a.m. \n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which represents major European automakers including Volkswagen, says it "recognizes the gravity of the situation and is taking this very seriously." \n\nHowever, it said "there is no evidence that this is an industry-wide issue." \n\nVW has admitted to using software to get its cars to pass U.S. emissions tests. It is facing the prospect of multiple investigations and lawsuits.
0757_72e303c3-d3c7-4868-bd04-999659c42c67	By Alistair Bell and Arshad Mohammed \n \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton vowed on Wednesday not to shrink from military action against Iran if it tries to obtain atomic weapons and threatened to impose penalties on Tehran for even for small violations of its nuclear deal with world powers. \n \nIn a speech to a Washington think tank, the former secretary of state reiterated her support for the accord but cautioned that she would take an approach of “distrust and verify” toward Iran if she won the November, 2016 presidential election. \n \n“As president, I will take whatever actions are necessary to protect the United States and our allies. I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon,” she said. \n \nClinton expects the Islamic Republic will try “to see how far they can bend the rules” of the agreement it reached in July with the United States and other major nations including Russia and China. \n \n“I’ll hold the line against Iranian noncompliance. That means penalties even for small violations,” she said. \n \n \n \n \n \nIn tough comments, Clinton said “there is absolutely no reason to trust Iran” given its history of concealing aspects of its nuclear program and destabilizing the Middle East. \n \nIran denies its nuclear program is aimed at producing weapons. \n \nAmerica’s top diplomat from 2009-2013, Clinton has a stake in the Iran deal succeeding. She helped lay the groundwork for it by building support for sanctions that the Obama administration credits with bringing Tehran to the negotiating table. \n \nShe said she was then involved in the early stages of opening a secret diplomatic channel to Iran via the sultan of Oman. \n \nAs the race for the White House intensifies, Republicans want to show that the Iran accord proves Clinton was ineffective in office and made the world less secure. \n \n“Hillary Clinton’s central role in crafting this dangerous agreement is one of the many examples of her failed record as Secretary of State,” Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. \n \nCongress is expected to begin voting this week on a Republican-led measure to block the deal, which is aimed at preventing Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \n \nBut President Barack Obama has enough support in the Senate to prevent lawmakers from derailing it. Republicans and some Democrats believe the deal is not strict enough, and the main Republican candidates say they will scrap it should one of them win in 2016. \n \n(Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson Editing by W Simon) \n  Politics  Government  Foreign Policy  Hillary Clinton  Iran   \n\n \nArticle source: Article Source \n\nThe post appeared first on .
0758_43742e98-d53e-4adb-a1eb-7da2baa7b9b5	Last night's heavy rain wreaked havoc on western parts of the country last night, as roads were closed due to flooding and a landslide. The status orange rainfall warning remains in place for Kerry until midday, while the status yellow warning for Galway, Mayo and Clare, Cork and Limerick will also remain in place until the same time. Forecasters have warned that up to 70mm of rain will fall over Kerry before noon.\n\nHowever, the worst area affected areas last night were Clifden, Co Galway and Achill, Co Mayo, according to AA Roadwatch spokesperson Arwen Foley.\n\nLate last night, gardaí in Clifden, Co Galway, warned motorists to travel only in exceptional circumstances due to extremely heavy rainfall. Overnight rainfall hampered driving conditions, and Sky road in Clifden was closed due to a small landslide onto the road, while Beach road was closed due to flooding. Road closures were also enforced in the Cleggan area.\n\nLast night, a part of the Ring of Kerry – between Kells and Caherciven – was impassable, but this road has since reopened. “In Kerry it stopped raining at around 11pm last night. There was flooding in a few places and parts of west Kerry seem to have been worst affected.” Ms Foley said a few roads around Tralee were flooded and rendered impassable last night, and though these roads have reopened care is still needed.\n\nThe road between Mulranny and Achill in Mayo is now passable again, AA Roadwatch says. The latest warnings came after flooding incidents in the south-west over the weekend.\n\nTwenty homes were flooded in Miltown Malbay in Co Clare. Fire crews rescued a couple trapped in their car in the coastal village of Liscannor, also in Clare, with the county council forced to issue a travel warning to other motorists.\n\n"It is like someone picked up our house and dropped it into the path of a river, I've never seen the like of it," said Liscannor resident Grainne Flannery.\n\n"We're used to water coming in from the sea but not down from the hills. It was so strange to see. Sandbags would have been useless because the water was coming from everywhere."\n\nIn Ballyvourney, Co Cork, gardai closed roads as flood waters turned to rivers.\n\nIn Cork city last night, residents of areas hit by flood waters were taking no chances as they deployed sandbags to protect their homes.\n\nThe rainfall at the weekend was exceptional, said Irish Weather Online's Fergal Tierney.\n\n"At least two trillion litres of rain fell on Ireland on Friday and Saturday," he said.\n\n"I took the average rainfall over the 26 synoptic stations - 23.6 mm. However, mountainous regions will have received several times this value, except there are no stations up there to record it.\n\n"It's a lot of water, whichever way you look at it. It's enough to fill almost 800,000 Olympic swimming pools."\n\nBut the same counties which were pounded by heavy rain on Friday and Saturday were at the centre of the new alerts last night, as more heavy rain hit the west and south-west.\n\n"We can expect heavy rain and thundery downpours with the possibility of localised flooding, particularly in the west and south-west," said Met Eireann forecaster Evelyn Cusack.\n\n"While the south-west and west will receive the brunt of the bad weather, the north and north-west will be mainly dry and bright, with just a few scattered showers."\n\nThe weather is expected to settle later today and remain mainly bright and dry tomorrow. But a new low-pressure front could bring very heavy rain to the east and south-east of the country on Wednesday.\n\n"There is a risk of another spell of heavy rain in parts of the south and east as another frontal depression tracks near Ireland," said Cusack.\n\n"It will be cool and breezy, with highest temperatures of only 12C to 15C in fresh to strong north-easterly winds."\n\nThursday and Friday will be bright, blustery days with sunny spells and good drying, alongside passing heavy showers.

Latest updates \n  here             \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  (L-R) Reyaad Khan, Junaid Hussain and Rahul Amin        \n\t\t        90000  2015-09-08 09:24:29.0  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11850204/Syria-More-air-strikes-could-be-ordered-government-warns-live.html?service=artBody  This page will automatically update every 90 seconds On  Off     \n • Michael Fallon: More terrorists planning UK attacks \n• Government 'limited' in what evidence it can release \n• Debate over legality of killing of British-born jihadist \n• Everything we know about the three dead Britons \n• Reyaad Khan was target of RAF drone  \nLatest 9.21 Does the government have a 'kill list'? \nMichael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, earlier denied the Government has a "kill list" but said he "would not hesitate" to carry out a similar strike. \n\n It's the other way around, it's the terrorists out there in Isil headquarters in Raqqah in north-east Syria it's they who have a kill list," he added.  \n\n "They have plans to mount a series of attack on Britain, our job is to identify those attacks, identify the terrorists and where we can forestall them.  \n\n "But if you're asking me would we hesitate to take similar action again today, tomorrow, next week absolutely not we would not hesitate."  \n\n [embedded content] \n8.38 \nTory MP David Davis has called for "constraint" on the targeted killing of terrorists: \n\n I've got little doubt that the Prime Minister acted properly in all of this. That is not the issue. My concern is that if you go down this route then we want to be very wary of ending up like the Americans. Obama has every Thursday morning meetings to drop a death list of hits with drones. The result of that? A lot of them hit in Pakistan and killed a lot of innocent people as well. It became counter-productive. It actually made a lot of Pakistanis anti-American and it helps the terrorist movement there.  \n\n "We've got to have some sort of constraint on this. We've got to have some sort of check if you like."  \n\nHe has called for a new process to be put in place where a judge would review any actions carried out. \n\n David Davis MP   Photo: PAUL GROVER \n8.25 \nMichael Fallon has continued his interview by confirming that the government plans to ask parliament once again for permission to carry out air strikes on Syria. \n\nThe last time this happened Ed Miliband, the then leader of the Labour party, helped by more than 30 Tory rebels, defeated the plan. \n\nMr Fallon said: \n\n The new parliament will have to rethink the absurdity of us not being able to strike Isil's commander control centres in Syria.  \n\n To get parliamentary approval we have to be sure that we would win the vote. We have got to persuade parliament and we have got to take parliament with us. We have a small majority. There were some 30 Conservative colleagues and a lot of Labour MPs who voted against but the circumstances have moved on.  \n\n The issue now is whether we are prepared to tackle Isil. We have to think much more deeply about how we deal with the very centre, the brain cell of this operation."  \n8.17 \nThe threat to the UK remains significant, Mr Fallon insists. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \n\n  There are other terrorists involved in plots which may come to fruition over the next weeks or months. There are a group of people who have a list of targets and are planning armed attacks on our streets.  \n\n If there is no other way of preventing these attacks that are likely to take place on our streets other than a military strike then that is what we will do."  \n\nHe said it would be right to infer that there are more than just two or three terrorists plotting attacks. \n8.05 \nMichael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has refused to rule out further assassinations of terrorists planning attacks in Britain. \n\nA British jihadist was killed by UK forces in Syria after he directed a plot to kill the Queen, it emerged on Monday. \n\n Defence Secretary Michael Fallon   Photo: JANE MINGAY \n\nIn a move David Cameron said was “a new departure” for Britain, Reyaad Khan was last month assassinated in an RAF drone strike after security services uncovered his bid to stage a terror attack in the UK. \n\nThe Prime Minister said that it is the first time UK forces have directed a targeted attack against one of its own citizens when Britain is not at war. \n\nBut Mr Fallon warned today that there were "many other terrorists out there who are already involved in planning attacks on this country". \n\nHe added that the government would be "limited" in what evidence it could release to prove that Khan was indeed plotting an attack. \n\nHe said: "Imagine the outcry if it transpired that one of the events were to take place but we had done nothing about it." \n\n"We wouldn't hesitate to do it again if we know an armed attack is likely." \n       telegraph.co.uk

I could go on and on and on and throw Aretha Franklin in too.” \n \nKeith recently confirmed the Rolling Stones have made “definite plans” to record a new album. \n \nQuestioned about the band’s return to the studio on the red carpet at the premiere, he said: “They aren’t there yet but they are on their way.” \n \nNeville, who won a best-documentary Oscar for 20 Feet From Stardom, his film about backing singers, said Keith is the ultimate subject for a music documentary. \n Keith Richards with Morgan Neville (Evan Agostini/Invision) \n“He is about as archetypal rock and roll as you get and part of the film was about realising that there is more than that image of Keith, he is so much more than that. He is actually a living, breathing, smart, funny human being. \n \n“I discovered that he paints and I didn’t know that, they are beautiful watercolours. He was painting a ship that has rusted and was sinking in a shallow harbour.” \n \nHe added that the months he spent on the road with Keith were some of the best he has had. \n \n“This was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done, he’s funny and loose and the making of this film was the same, seat of the pants rock and roll and whatever happens, happens.” \n   \n Share article  \n   \nCrosseyed Heart is out today and the documentary is streaming on Netflix now.
0763_72e60ffb-779b-4568-a7e7-8ce58d693654	President Barack Obama is on the verge of a major foreign policy victory. \n \nSupporters of the Iran nuclear agreement are now just one vote shy of locking in enough support to preserve the deal after two Senate Democrats said Tuesday they would back it. Just about an hour apart, Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania announced their support. \n\nAmidst growing momentum for the deal, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin of Maryland, predicted that by the end of the week, Obama will have secured the 34 Senate votes he would need to sustain his veto of a resolution of disapproval Republicans are planning to bring up later this month. \n\nThe steady and growing Democratic support comes despite nearly unified opposition from congressional Republicans and a heavy and expensive lobbying campaign by outside interest groups who fear the agreement isn't strong enough and will allow Iran to eventually build a nuclear bomb. \n\n"I am voting to support this agreement not because I think it is perfect, or because I believe it is the mechanism to end nuclear proliferation in the region. I am voting for this agreement because it is our most credible opportunity now to lead a global community in containing an existential threat while preserving America's ability to use economic power and military might to successfully dismantle a nuclear program should diplomacy fail," Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an address at the University of Delaware. \n\n"I will vote to support the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action because I believe it is the best option available to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon," Casey said in a 17-page statement explaining his position. "It places strict limitations on Iran's nuclear program, requires robust monitoring and verification measures, and grants relief only from nuclear sanctions in exchange for verified actions on Iran's part." \n\nCardin, speaking to a group of Johns Hopkins University students even before Coons and Casey made their public announcements, predicted ultimate success. \n\n"The President will have at least 32 committed Democrats on his side by the end of today and that number looks like will clearly get to the 34 number by the end of the week," he said. \n\nCardin, who is influential on international affairs, has not said how he will vote. He worked with Republicans to ensure Congress would get a vote on the deal, something the Obama administration initially opposed and has warned will kill the deal. He lamented that the lobbying "has been intense on both sides." \n\n"I think it's a tough call," said Cardin. "I think there are high risks either way." \n\nCardin is a senior Jewish senator, and some of the most vocal opposition to the Iran deal has come from Jewish constituents and pro-Israel organizations. \n\nMore senior House Democrats also endorsed the Iran agreement on Tuesday. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, released a statement saying he backed the agreement. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, also said he would vote for it. Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries announced their support, too. \n\nHouse Democratic leadership aides continue to express confidence they will secure enough votes to uphold a veto in the event that a resolution blocking the deal is sent to the President's desk. \n\nOnly two Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, have announced opposition to the deal. Just under a dozen Democratic senators remain unannounced. \n\nCoons said he spoke to all the remaining undecided senators, but declined to predict how they will vote. \n\nOnly one Republican senator is considered a possible vote in favor of the bill. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine will announce her decision next week, according to her staff. \n\n"She remains concerned about some key aspects of the agreement, including the lack of a good inspection regime, which will make verification extremely difficult, and the lifting of the embargoes on conventional arms and intercontinental ballistic missile technology," her office said in a recent statement. \n\nSupporters of the deal hope to get at least 41 votes to block the disapproval resolution from even coming up for a final vote in the Senate. \n\n"I think that will be a very close call," Coons said when asked about that Tuesday. \n\nHouse Republicans could schedule a vote as early as next week on the GOP resolution to scuttle the deal, but no decisions have been made yet, according to a senior House GOP leadership aide. If it becomes clear that 41 or more Democrats signal they will filibuster the resolution in the Senate, the House is likely to move ahead with a vote soon after Congress returns from its summer recess. \n\nSenate leaders have not said when they will vote. There is a statutory deadline of Sept. 17, but votes may be scheduled several days before that because a Jewish holiday and a Republican presidential debate are complicating the timetable.

The over 4,000 percent increase also caught the eye of Hillary Clinton. She tweeted about it Monday, saying she wanted to put an end to drug "price gouging." \n\nThe Daily Beast declared Shkreli the "most-hated man in America," surpassing the dentist who killed Cecil the Lion. \n \nShkreli says he has heard the outcry. \n\n"We've agreed to lower the price of Daraprim to a price that is more affordable," Shkreli said on ABC World News Tonight. \n\nHe didn't say what that "affordable" price would be, but stressed that the company already gives away the drug for free to about half the patients who use it and that Turing plans to expand its charitable drug program. \n\nShkreli has been defending himself on Twitter and in numerous TV interviews. \n\n"We needed to turn a profit on the drug," Shkreli told Bloomberg, arguing that companies that owned the drug before were giving it away at $13.50. \n\nHe says it's not just about turning profit. Turing plans to use the money to research a better way to treat diseases. The drug is used by some AIDS and cancer patients. It's been around for decades but Shkreli's company just bought the rights to it in August. The main use of the drug is to treat life-threatening parasitic infections. \n\n"They don't deserve a drug that is 70 years old," he said about Daraprim, adding: "I know what we're doing is right." \n\nShkreli is only 32 years old. He's been called everything from a boy genius to a vulture. \n\n"I guess some people think Daraprim access will decline instead of increase. I guarantee better access at lower prices to patients than ever," tweeted Shkreli. \n\nKnown for being very candid on Twitter -- he tweeted Monday "It seems like the media immediately points a finger at me so I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie" -- he opted to make his account private on Tuesday night. \n\nHis outspoken tweets were one of the reasons he was ousted as CEO of his prior company, Retrophin. \n \n© Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.

0766_0bb8756e-644a-4ff5-8de1-c31a3c611c04	A British father who feared his baby had been swapped at birth and sold to human traffickers in El Salvador has reportedly been reunited with his son after authorities tracked down the child by ordering other new mothers have their babies DNA tested. \n \n\t\t \nRichard Cushworth, 41, originally from Bradford, West Yorkshire,  and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes Casanellas had suspected that a doctor at the hospital where she gave birth exchanged their child for another as she slept. \n  It is feared the youngster was switched at birth   \nAfter attending a special court hearing before a judge yesterday the couple were told that their biological baby had been identified before the swapped babies were handed back to their respective families, according to news website  Elsalvador.com. \n\n\t\t\t \nAttorney general Luis Martinez told reporters: "We have returned the babies to their legitimate parents.  We hope that this has not happened on other occasions." \n\n\n\n \nMr Martinez said that a review of private and public hospitals' protocols would take place. \n\nThe couple's doctor, Alejandro Guidos, was arrested over the matter but had protested his innocence after being bailed. \n\nProsecutor Dinora Siguenza reportedly alleged yesterday that Dr Guidos was responsible for not following correct procedures and is still being investigated. \n\nThe couple left the Gynaecological Hospital Centre in the country's capital San Salvador with the newborn but made a public appeal on local TV three months on, after a DNA test revealed the boy was unlikely to be their biological son. \n\n\t\t\t \nMs Casanellas, 39, initially became suspicious when she noticed the features of her newborn differed from those of the boy doctors handed her the day after she gave birth by emergency Caesarean in May. In particular, she thought the second baby had darker skin. \n\nShe took the child to the couple's home in Dallas, Texas, but the pair, both missionaries working in El Salvador, returned to the Central American country after family members also expressed doubts. \n\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in regular contact with the Cushworth family to provide support. \n\n"A full investigation has been launched by local police and we will provide all the assistance that we can." \n\n\t\t\t \n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

0770_468d455c-8878-498b-9bd8-dd863bc7238a	HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Governor Tom Wolf today addressed the serious problem of hunger and inadequate nutrition in the commonwealth by issuing an executive order to coordinate Pennsylvania's food and nutrition programs. According to the order, the governor will appoint an advisor to lead a newly-formed 'Governor's Food Security Partnership.'\n\n"Hunger remains a serious problem in Pennsylvania, with too many of our citizens unable to access food for themselves or their families," Governor Wolf said. "Pennsylvania administers state and federal funds for food programs serving the elderly, families, pregnant women, infants and children. Through the coordination of these varied public and private sector resources, we can ensure access to much-needed food and nutrition." The executive order was announced at the 2015 Pennsylvania Food Security Summit at the Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg, sponsored by the Departments of Aging, Agriculture, Education, Community and Economic Development, Health, and Human Services. All six cabinet secretaries participated in a state government panel discussion to address coordinating hunger issues within the public sector.The executive order directs that the advisor to the governor be responsible for, among many things: the coordination of interdepartmental efforts to reduce hunger and improve nutrition; review and evaluate operations and policies of all state and federal food and nutrition programs administered by the commonwealth; organize private and public sector efforts to improve the commonwealth's response to the needs of citizens; work with state and federal officials, as well as local providers, to increase the effectiveness and accessibility of federal and state programs; convene meetings and oversee activities of the new partnership; and present findings and recommendations of the partnership to the governor, associated state agencies, and the legislature.\n\n"Food is a basic human right and no one should ever go hungry," said Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. "When we have even one person who is facing a choice between paying the utility bill or buying food for the week, we have a fundamental problem. As public servants, it is not only our duty, but our responsibility to tackle food insecurity and provide needed resources to our residents. No one should go hungry."\n\nHunger impacts every county across the commonwealth. According to Feeding America's "Map the Meal Gap" data, more than 1.8 million Pennsylvanians – one out of seven – are at risk of hunger and may not know where their next meal is coming from. That number includes over 564,000 children – one out of five. \n\nGovernor Wolf's 2015-2016 budget makes the largest investment in years to the commonwealth's food security systems, proposing $3 million dollars to fund, for the first time, the Pennsylvania Agricultural Surplus System (PASS). Funds made available through PASS will provide the state's emergency food providers with resources to support Pennsylvania's agricultural producers, aiding in their efforts to get even more locally-produced and sourced commodities into the hands of those in need of food assistance.\n\n"The importance of public and private partnerships to combat food insecurity is critical," said Dept. of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas. "The only way for us to ensure the success of this project is through true collaboration across the commonwealth. By working together we can combine the necessary experience, knowledge, investment, technologies and resources to address issues which may have previously been overlooked."\n\nEducation Secretary Pedro Rivera stressed that nutrition is critical to the success of all of Pennsylvania's learners – young and old. Partnerships with other state agencies ensured by Governor Wolf's Executive Order will help more students and families gain access to healthy, nutritious meals in school, at home, and on the go.\n\n"As parents and educators, one of the simplest things we want for our children is for them to grow up to be happy and healthy. Part of being healthy includes learning about proper nutrition and developing food eating habits," Rivera said. "With many kids eating up to half of their daily calories at school, healthy school meals and snacks are a commonsense step to ensure all children, including those at high risk for obesity, grow up a healthy weight."\n\nThe Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act, due for reauthorization by September 30, 2015, authorizes all of the federal child nutrition programs, including the School Breakfast, National School Lunch, Child and Adult Care Food, and Summer Food Service Programs and WIC. The reauthorization provides an opportunity to strengthen and improve these programs to ensure that low-income children have access to healthy and nutritious foods where they live, learn, and play. The Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health, and Human Services recently signed a letter to the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation outlining 11 priorities for reauthorization.\n\nIn addition to the governor's executive order, today's Food Security Summit also engaged non-profits and other industry stakeholders.

Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on," Clinton said on Twitter. \n \nMajor drugmakers including Pfizer  , Gilead Sciences  , Merck  , and Bristol-Myers Squibb  were all lower. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was down 4.9% while the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF  was off 5.7%. \n \nCommodity markets were rallying as investors continued to digest data out Friday that showed a drop in active drilling rigs in the U.S. The decline could signal a slowdown in U.S. production that would address a supply-demand imbalance in commodity markets. \n \nU.S. oil producers idled eight more rigs over the past week, bringing the total to 644 according to Baker Hughes data. That marks a third straight week. The oil rig count is now down 60% from a peak set last October. West Texas Intermediate closed up 4.5% to $46.68 a barrel. \n \nExxon Mobil  , Chevron  , Williams , Halliburton  and Schlumberger  were all higher, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF jumped 1%. \n \nExisting home sales dropped in August for the first time in four months, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales in the U.S. dropped 4.8% to an annual pace of 5.31 million, below an estimated drop to 5.52 million. July sales were revised down to 5.58 million, though remained at their highest level in eight years. \n \nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Sunday that the decision to hold interest rates near crises levels was a "close call." Williams told Fox Sunday Morning Futures that the decision was based upon recent concern over the global financial system. \n \nSeparately, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told The Wall Street Journal he had argued for a rate hike given the economy's recovery. \n \nStocks have been under pressure after the Fed made it clear last week that a rate hike this year was still likely. The Fed's dot plot forecast showed that Fed members expect interest rates to close out the year at 0.40%, meaning a hike in October or December is a possibility. A majority of Fed members expect to raise rates this year, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference." \n \nFormer Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras scored an unexpected second chance after securing a clear election victory over the weekend. Tsipras had stepped down over the summer after ditching his anti-austerity platform to seal a deal with eurozone creditors for more debt relief. The leftist Syriza party also secured enough votes to only need one ally, the Independent Greeks, rather than a number of different parties as it has over the past eight months. The Athens Stock Exchange fell 1%. \n    next   last »
0772_cdb2d5d6-b1c0-409a-a3ee-fe0b37fa999d	This awkward photo of Obama and Putin locking eyes at the UN speaks volumes vox ^ Posted on 9/28/2015, 6:38:05 PM by traumer Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin’s relationship has always been, shall we say, fraught, but on Monday they shared a toast at the United Nations that looks to have been, even by their high standards, pretty weird. There’s so much to take in here. The nuclear powers side-eye. Putin’s almost triumphalist smirk; Obama’s undisguised loathing (there’s an unmistakable “let’s get this over with” look on his face) of the man with whom he’s touching glasses. The discrepancy in size between the two men — look at how much farther Obama’s arm reached than Putin’s — adds another layer to it all. But their eyes sure are locked. I thought Mashable’s global news editor, Louise Roug, put it best when she wrote, “They clearly see side-eye to side-eye on things.” This was a scripted event, but there was still plenty of reason for awkwardness. President Obama’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly that morning opened with an extended subtweet of Russian President Vladimir Putin, lamenting for example that “some major powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law” (gee, I wonder which major powers). From there, Obama transitioned from implicit criticism of Putin to explicit, going point by point on Russia’s misdeeds in Ukraine. Putin returned the favor, giving a lengthy UN address of his own on Monday — his first since 2005 — blaming the United States for the wars in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine.

We got super busy at work. I couldn’t physically handle programmering for 10+ hours a day and then draw or paint for another couple hours afterward. My forearms and hands are shot and my dexterity has deteriorated.\n\n\nBut now that work has let up and I’ve had a couple days to recover, I’m going to try to commit to daily sketches. Even if it’s just for a half hour. I need to regain my confidence with my tools and my eye. And I need a new Moleskine because this one has a strange dent on every single fucking page.
0775_ee67a686-a07c-4d81-8dbb-a731cfa5f463	Add to that now the signal failures of Barack Obama: 1) no prosecution or attempted regulation of widespread financial misdeeds 2) no effort to counter the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allows corporations to buy elections; 3) no end to dubious military operations in distant lands, and 4) healthcare “reform” that only fortified the existing rackets — take all that together and you can only recoil from whatever it means to be a Democrat. \n \nAnd now the return of Hillary, gliding above the election arena like Rodan the Flying Reptile — caw! caw! Get me outa here! It’s not just her, of course. It’s the whole disgusting circus parade of identity politics, and PC witch-hunting, and trans-sex drum-beating, and girl-lugging-a-mattress-around-campus idiocy, and blame-it-all-on-Whitey whinging, and drone-strike-du-jour warfare, and out-of-control NSA surveillance monkey business, plus throw in the outrageous scams of “civil forfeiture” under a president who was supposedly a professor of constitutional law — the list of Democratic-sponsored absurdities and turpitudes gives me the vapors. \n \nThe New York Times ran a front-page story Sunday saying that the Republican nomination-chasers were sounding too ominous, too dark, about the state of the nation, at least for the purpose of getting elected. As if the Times has an interest in them succeeding. I guess they were “just sayin’.” For my money, you can’t paint a dark enough picture to fully capture the decadence and depravity in the current zeitgeist. This, after all, is the basic appeal of Trump — though a panoramic shot of his supporters in one of those stadium love-fests suggests that their very demeanor is a big part of the problem: crowds of overfed tattooed clowns in nursery togs clamoring for a return to 1956. Good luck with that. \n  \nhttp://www.zerohedge...-democrat-rages

0777_90d07fd7-b2b5-47ad-8308-f5b10146e4b0	Political cartoon (Photo: CagleCartoons) \n\nCarper, Coons short-sighted on Iran \n\nRick Jensen’s column on Sens. Chris Coons and Tom Carper is right on the money. Why the “C Boys” are backing this deal does not jibe with all their regular political talk. Personally, I thought their unlimited give always applied only to welfare and not the defense and safety of our nation. \n\nDelaware, what your senators are saying is, “We don’t care what happens to the United States or the world 15 years from now.” A bit short sighted, but then again, they will probably be out of office (we hope) before the first bomb drops. \n\nWhat about your children and grandchildren? What about the neighbors of Iran? This is one of the most short-sighted actions by the “C Boys” I have ever seen. \n\nFritz Land \n\nNewark \n\nIgnorance is not real patriotism \n\nRick Jensen should relocate to a more-southern state, where his vile right-wing nonsense columns are more appreciated by American-speaking rednecks who think they are patriotic when acting ignorant. \n\nJohn F. Connelly Jr. \n\nWilmington \n\nToo many suspects still on the loose \n\nIt seems like I find this sentence somewhere each day in the paper: “suspect charged with possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited,” or “suspect has active warrants.” What agencies are responsible for this? Is it the police who must re-arrest these people, or is it our legal system which seems to just turn these people loose on the rest of us, with no further responsibility? Someone must be held accountable. These agencies are supposed to be working for us, not the law breakers. If they can not do their jobs because of “lack of resources or manpower,” let’s either take all the laws off the books, or come up with the money to fund them properly with whatever it takes. Come on, Delaware, you can stop this insanity. \n\nDon Parsons \n\nMilford \n\nDelaware’s delegation needs backbone \n\nI am having trouble these days understanding the President’s Foreign Policy. It is so unlike the policy of the Great Democratic Presidents of the 20th century: Roosevelt, Truman and John Kennedy. Makes me wonder – looking back, I was barely 9 at the time – whether I would have made it to the 21st century with Obama and Kerry, instead of John Kennedy and Dean Rusk. At the very least, Mr. President, get the four Americans back. You traded five terrorists for a deserter. You cannot trust Iran. Remember 1979? How many of our soldiers are maimed because of Iran’s involvement in the Iraq war? To me, you seem more worried about your legacy. Sen. Carper says he supports the deal because of the military option. Are you going to draw another red line, like the one in Syria? Now we have Russia involved with Iran. Iranians are shouting death to America, death to Israel. Finally, like Neville Chamberlain in 1938 when dealing with Hitler, you claim the only option is war. I do not buy that. I wish our Congressional Delegation had more of a backbone. I pray you are right, for the sake of my children and grandchildren. I just cannot see making a deal with Satan. \n\nRobert F. Poppiti Sr. \n\nWilmington \n\nKim Davis is a Christian of principle \n\nAs a Christian, Kim Davis must put her religious principles ahead of civil law. The alternative is to remove all Christians from civil positions so they are not faced with firing them. Would the same thing happen is she were Muslim? Noah Feldman’s column seems to say that no people of principle are welcome in government jobs. \n\nElizabeth Schnepp \n\nNewark \n\nDelaware not responsible for other states \n\nAlthough I sympathize with the writer from Millsboro in reference to her brother in Florida needing medical assistance, I am totally dumbfounded that she would think the Delaware 911 Centers would somehow be able to a) Immediately switch her to the correct emergency center several states away, but b) even have the slightest idea what county or agency would be the correct one to transfer her to, if they even physically were able to do so. The suggestion for her to call 411 was not a referral to a specific emergency agency, but the number to ask for and receive the correct telephone number to ask for help in the needed area. Why she would assume that a Delaware agency would have immediate access to another state’s numbers, etc., is difficult to comprehend. I no more expect our emergency centers to know who takes care of an address in Milwaukee than I expect the reverse. I’m very glad that her brother is safe, but rather than belittle the state of Delaware for not knowing an emergency contact number for the state of Florida, I would question why she herself would not have that particular 10 digit telephone number for just such a situation. \n\nAfter all, we are responsible for our own situations; we can’t nor should we expect our local, overstrained emergency resources to also be able to instantly connect someone to any other part of the world within seconds. Determine all emergency contact numbers for any loved ones who live in different locations and keep them posted in a quickly located place. The 911 system is local for each state and county, not for every single place all together in the United States. \n\nBeth Langston Bishop \n\nDover \n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1F3mUOD

This teenager was going home and passed a bus stop where a man and woman were arguing. He could see the fear in her eyes and made a decision. He chatted up the guy who asked for money for bus tickets. Malyk decided to buy them both bus tickets and lie and say he was going where they were as well. He made friends with the guy on the bus. When they got to their destination, he offered to buy them dinner. Malyk’s cell phone had died, so he went to a restroom and borrowed a phone to call the police. They came and arrested the man for kidnapping and the woman wept with gratitude. Bonnet is a reluctant hero, but one nonetheless. Image Credit: Screen Shot/ CBC News From IJReview: Seventeen-year-old Malyk Bonnet says he doesn’t think of himself as a hero. But the woman who owes her life to his courage and good judgment would probably disagree. As CBC News reports, Bonnet was on his way home from work when he noticed a couple arguing by a bus stop. Persuaded that the man might hit the woman, Bonnet approached them. When the man asked Bonnet for money to take the bus to Laval, Quebec, Bonnet noticed how frightened the woman seemed and formulated a plan. He decided to give the couple money for the bus trip, and told them that he also lived in Laval and would travel with them. “My plan was to keep them in a public place, where there’s a lot of people,” Bonnet told CBC News. “I decided to make myself friendly with the man, so he would trust me. So I played my game,” Bonnet said.” As he rode with the couple to Laval, making friendly conversation with the man — and waiting for the right opportunity to call the police — Bonnet had no way of knowing that the police were already searching for the couple. The man was an ex-boyfriend who had already assaulted and made death threats against the young woman. “We were looking for a 29-year-old woman who was kidnapped by her former boyfriend earlier that day, and we believed that man was very dangerous,” said Lt. Daniel Guérin of the Laval police. Unfortunately, Bonnet’s cell phone died and he needed to find a way to make contact with the authorities. After they arrived in Laval, Bonnet offered to buy the couple a meal and even gave them $50 for food. Image Credit: Facebook While in the restaurant, Bonnet pretended to go to the restroom and used another customer’s cell phone to call the police. The Laval police arrived minutes later and arrested the kidnapper, who hadn’t even realized that it was Bonnet who turned him in. “He was really surprised, he didn’t know that it was me,” Bonnet told the CBC. “So I played my game right.” As her abductor was taken into custody, the woman’s relief was obvious. “She was almost crying. She was so happy, so happy not to be with him,” said Bonnet. Though Bonnet says that he wasn’t worried about his own safety, he is being commended by the Laval police for his good deed. The officers took up a collection to reimburse Bonnet for the bus fare and food money he spent in following the kidnapper and intend to nominate him for an award for bravery. “He managed the situation very well and took good decisions that probably saved the life of this woman,” Lt. Guérin told the CBC. Bonnet’s heroism has made him a bit of a celebrity in his home city of Montreal, where he was even featured on the front page of the Journal de Montreal. During his interview with CBC News, several passers-by stopped to shake his hand, and one even asked Bonnet to pose for a selfie with him. It’s fitting, however, that Bonnet’s biggest fan is his mother. “My mom is so proud of me,” said Bonnet. ‘She bought like eight Journals. She’s like, ‘I’m going to show them to your kids one day.’” Bonnet did what few others would have done and in doing so, he saved a life. The police are putting him up for an award for bravery. The police raised money to reimburse Bonnet, who didn’t ask for it. This kid is a true role model for others. This is a very brave young man and he handled the situation brilliantly. His mom is beyond proud of Malyk and she should be. I just wish there were more like him. Canadians have heroes in their midst and this is one of them. It’s refreshing to hear a happy ending for a change. Malyk Bonnet will grow to be a true leader. What he did wasn’t just a good deed, it was an act of life-saving courage and selflessness. Also see...\nThe Liberal Vision For The Poor Vs.

ABCNews.com                                                Share        \nABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos Copy          \n \n\nThe latest on the county clerk in Kentucky who has refused to issue marriage licenses since the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage (all times local): \n \n3:20 p.m. \n \nAn attorney for Kentucky clerk Kim Davis says the contempt hearing a federal judge held was a "charade." \n \nMat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, said U.S. District Judge David Bunning knew he was going to send Davis to jail on Thursday before he heard one word of her testimony. He accused the judge of violating constitutional law and said he will file an appeal and a writ of habeas corpus to get her released. That's a legal action that seeks relief from unlawful imprisonment. \n \nBunning sent Davis to jail because she refused to issue licenses to gay couples. Bunning said she could stay out of jail if she agreed to not interfere with her deputies handing out licenses, but she refused. \n \nDavis is being held in isolation at the jail. Her attorney says she is reading the Bible and is in good spirits. \n \n——— \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nAn attorney for Kentucky clerk Kim Davis says she has a "clean conscience" as she sits in jail for contempt because she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. \n \nMat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, said Friday that the licenses that were handed out Friday are void and "not worth paper that they are written on." At least three gay couples received licenses in Rowan County from her deputies on Friday. \n \nStaver says Davis will appeal the contempt order. He says he met with Davis in jail and she is in very good spirits. He says he doesn't know how long she will be jailed, but she has no intention of resigning and she will not violate her conscience. \n \n——— \n \n12:35 p.m. \n \nA third gay couple has received a marriage license in Rowan County as a defiant clerk sits in jail over her refusal to issue the licenses. \n \nApril Miller held her marriage license over her head Friday and shrieked "We got it!" as Karen Roberts, her partner of 11 years, let out a joyous whoop. \n \nThe couple was among those that sued county clerk Kim Davis over her refusal. Roberts says she doesn't want to be a hero, "just want to be a woman who got a marriage license today." \n \nThe couple said they plan to get married soon. \n \n——— \n \n11:45 a.m. \n \nAttorneys for the jailed county clerk in Kentucky say they will hold a news conference Friday afternoon after meeting with Kim Davis. \n \nMat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, said they will meet with Davis and then update the media about 2:30 p.m. Davis was sent to jail Thursday for contempt after refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. \n \nThere's no sign Davis is getting out of jail soon. Her husband says she will stay there as long as it takes, and the federal judge who sent her there has indicated she would be there at least a week. \n \nRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee plans to meet with her in jail next week. \n \n——— \n \n11:25 a.m. \n \nAs the county clerk, Kim Davis' signature usually appears on marriage licenses, but since she is jailed, her deputy clerks are handing out licenses with no signature. \n \nThe Rowan County attorney and lawyers for the gay couples who have sued to get marriage licenses say they are legal and valid despite the lack of a signature. \n \nDavis was jailed Thursday by U.S. District Judge David Bunning because she refuses to issue licenses to gay couples. Bunning was asked during Davis' contempt hearing Thursday about the licenses being valid if Davis refuses to authorize them. He said it was up to the gay couples to take that chance. \n \n——— \n \n10:45 a.m. \n \nRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee says he plans to meet with the Kentucky clerk who has been jailed because she refuses to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. \n \nHuckabee said Friday that he would meet with Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis next week and hold a rally in support of her. Davis was held in contempt and sent to jail Thursday by U.S. District Judge David Bunning. \n \nDavis says her religious beliefs don't allow her to endorse gay marriage. As she was in jail Friday, one of her deputy clerks handed out two licenses to gay couples. \n \n——— \n \n9:35 a.m. \n \nA second gay couple has arrived at a Kentucky clerk's office to apply for a marriage license. \n \nTimothy and Michael Long arrived Friday morning, about an hour after another gay couple was issued a license by a deputy clerk. \n \nThe clerk who oversees the Rowan County clerk's office, Kim Davis, remained jailed after defying several court orders directing her to issue the licenses. Davis refused to issue any marriage licenses, citing her Christian beliefs and opposition to gay marriage. \n \nWhen the couple got inside the office Friday, a man harassed them and said, "More sodomites getting married?" The couple did not respond, and a worker told the man to leave. \n \n——— \n \n9:15 a.m. \n \nDozens of protesters have gathered outside a Kentucky clerk's office where a gay couple has been issued a marriage license after a lengthy fight with a clerk who had long refused to grant the licenses. \n \nOne group cheered on the gay couple who got the license, while the other group preached and supported the clerk on Friday. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis has refused to issue the licenses, citing her Christian religion and belief that gay marriage is immoral. \n \nIn a heated exchange, supporters of Davis yelled "I'm telling you the truth because I love you" while opponents yelled back that "Jesus loves everyone." \n \nDavis remained jailed after a federal judge held her in contempt for defying several court orders. Her husband says she doesn't plan to resign and will not issue the licenses. \n \n——— \n \n8:15 a.m. \n \nA gay couple walked out of a Kentucky clerk's office with a marriage license, hours after the county's defiant clerk was hauled to jail for refusing to license same-sex marriages. \n \nWilliam Smith Jr. and James Yates, a couple for nearly a decade, were the first to receive a marriage license Friday morning in Rowan County, ending a months-long standoff. \n \nClerk Kim Davis has cited "God's authority" and refused to issue marriage licenses since the Supreme Court effectively legalized gay marriage in June. She defied a series of court orders. \n \nDeputy clerk Brian Mason issued the license Friday morning, congratulating the couple and shaking their hands as he smiled. The couple embraced and cried. \n \n——— \n \n8:10 a.m. \n \nA couple has arrived at a county clerk's office in Kentucky to obtain a marriage license. \n \nJames Yates and William Smith Jr. arrived Friday morning in Rowan County holding hands. They then approached deputy clerk Brian Mason to fill out an application. \n \nRowan County clerk Kim Davis remains jailed after defying several court orders and refusing to issue marriage licenses, citing her opposition to gay marriage. \n \nFive of Davis' deputy clerks said they would obey U.S. District Judge David Bunning's ruling and issue marriage licenses Friday morning. Bunning says Davis could remain in jail for at least a week as he gives her deputies time to comply with his order. \n \n——— \n \n8:05 a.m. \n \nA county clerk's office in Kentucky has opened as its clerk remains jailed, though no couples have arrived yet to obtain a marriage license. \n \nA throng of reporters was inside the Rowan County clerk's office Friday morning. But when a sheriff's deputy inside asked if anyone was there to get a license, no one answered. A line had been designated especially for marriage licenses. \n \nSupporters held signs saying "no shenanigans," a reference to a judge's warning a day earlier to a deputy clerk, Nathan Davis, the son of jailed clerk Kim Davis. \n \nFive of Davis' deputy clerks said they would obey U.S. District Judge David Bunning's ruling and issue marriage licenses Friday morning. Bunning says Davis could remain in jail for at least a week as he gives her deputies time to comply with his order. \n \n——— \n \n7:45 a.m. \n \nThe husband of a Kentucky court clerk jailed for refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay couples says she won't resign and will stay in jail for as long as it takes. \n \nSpeaking to reporters Friday morning, Joe Davis, the husband of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, said she's in good spirits after spending the night in jail. \n \nA federal district court judge jailed Kim Davis on Thursday for refusing to obey his order that she issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Davis, an Apostolic Christian, believes gay marriage is a sin. \n \nBut five of the six deputy clerks who work for Davis said they will issue the marriage licenses Friday. Joe Davis said he took the deputies out to dinner Thursday night and told them he was proud of them. He said they are only issuing the licenses because the judge is forcing them. \n \n——— \n \n4:25 a.m. \n \nSame-sex couples will return to the Rowan County Courthouse in Kentucky on Friday for the fifth time since June to ask for a marriage license. \n \nOnly this time, Kim Davis won't be there to stop them. The county clerk will be in a Carter County jail cell for refusing to obey a judge's order that she issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \n \nDavis said her Christian beliefs prevent her from issuing the licenses because she believes gay marriage is a sin. \n \nFive of Davis' deputy clerks said they would obey U.S. District Judge David Bunning's ruling and issue marriage licenses Friday morning. Bunning says Davis could remain in jail for at least a week as he gives her deputies time to comply with his order.

You might expect politicians to be trying to slow that process in the interest of preserving jobs for flesh-and-blood employees. In fact, they often act as though they have a thing for robots. At last, workers are pushing back Harold Meyerson On this Labor Day, American workers may be beginning to reclaim what by right should be theirs.

On this Labor Day, American workers may be beginning to reclaim what by right should be theirs. To be sure, the economic statistics continue to appall: In the second quarter of this year, for instance, labor costs rose at their lowest rate since the early '80s — a measly 0.2 percent, despite steady... ( Harold Meyerson ) Ed Rensi, the former CEO of McDonald's USA, recently told The Washington Post that when he worked at one of the chain restaurants in 1966, it had 70 or 80 employees — about double what it would use today. "When I first started at McDonald's making 85 cents an hour, everything we made was by hand," he recalled. Over the years, the company adopted all sorts of equipment and methods to reduce the need for people.\nThe home of the Golden Arches has plenty of company. Over the past decade, the average fast-food outlet has reduced employment by 11 percent. Olive Garden has decided to provide tablets so diners can order and pay without dealing with a server, who will be needed only to bring the food — at least until that step gets automated. Chili's is using them already. cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 Even so, the restaurant industry still employs some 8 million people. Many of them are getting more money in their paychecks as a result of minimum wage increases that have taken effect in more than 20 states this year, putting them above the $7.25-an-hour federal floor.\nPresident Barack Obama is pushing to raise that minimum to $10.10. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former Gov. Martin O'Malley, D-Md., both running for president, want to set it at $15. Several cities have embraced that idea. Designing, installing and maintaining labor-saving technology costs money, of course. But the more employees cost, the more attractive it becomes to replace them with gadgets and machines.\nThose advocating a higher floor point to Wal-Mart's recent decision to pay all workers at least $9 an hour.. But the world's largest retailer, faced with disappointing earnings, recently said it will "look for more efficiencies in our stores" — which doesn't sound like good news for those employees who got a raise.\nThe minimum wage is just one of the inducements to automation that governments are furnishing. A ruling last week by the National Labor Relations Board will make it easier for organized labor to unionize workers at companies that have individually owned franchise outlets, which includes most fast-food chains.\nRichard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, was thrilled. "It means more working people can engage in meaningful collective bargaining by bringing all parties who control their wages and other conditions of employment to the table," he said.\nIn the short term, that may raise wages, but in the long term, it may prompt restaurants to reduce the workforce.\nIn the movie "Ex Machina," a programmer finds himself falling for a robot designed to look and act like a human.

0785_202cc785-62ec-4ed0-9bb8-363e3774487d	The end has apparently come to the legislative process in Washington, D.C. The Iran nuclear agreement showed that the president will use whatever means he needs to achieve his own agenda. And he has enough Democrats in his hip pocket to ensure he can continue to do this. \n  \nAccording to polling data, 79 percent of Americans were opposed to this agreement. Proponents of the agreement quickly stated that these people didn’t have the facts. What were the facts? Like Obamacare, they weren’t made available. Another case of John Gruberism — the American people are too stupid to understand. Or Pelosi-ism: “How will we know what is in this legislation unless we pass it?” \n  \nSo this president used his 42 Democratic buddies to ram through this agreement. Thus a precedent is set. Anytime this president wants something, he lines up his 42 buddies and they once again ram through what he wants, regardless of what the American people want. Regardless of the legislative process our founding fathers established to ensure equal representation of citizens and the balance of governmental powers. \n  \nIt seems that both this president and these Democrats don’t care that they are elected to represent all the people. As one senator told my wife in a letter “(W)e know what is bet for you.” \n\n \n  \nHow terrifying that we’ve elected people who turn their backs on their constituents when the president tells them what to do. They now have the ability to pass any legislation they want. And there’s nothing that the American people can do about it. It apparently is a legal technicality which they gleefully use. We condemn Russian President Putin. But our legislative process and press aren’t a lot different. \n  \nIf the American people don’t cry out loudly against this process of ignoring the people and the legislative processes we have long used, then we’ll get an ever more powerful presidency. One that at some point may not need a Congress or Senate. \n  \n— Richard Spearrin Essex

She plans to be back at work this week,” said Staver. \n \n“Kim Davis cannot and will not violate her conscience,” Staver said. \n \nAs an Apostolic Christian, Davis says she believes a marriage can only be between a man and a woman. She has refused to issue any marriage licenses since the U.S. Supreme Court in June made same-sex marriages legal across the United States. \n \nWhile she was jailed, the county’s deputy clerks issued marriage licenses to several same-sex couples.

0790_6880a3e1-1044-4900-b2a6-6eaa3862d903	, the character Mork from Ork first appeared on our TV screens in an episode of Happy Days , and a TV icon and movie star’s career was launched. In September 1978, Mork debuted in his own show, which you may remember as Mork and Mindy, starring Robin Williams and Pam Dawber . \n\nIn the mid-1970s, Robin Williams was a fairly popular stand-up comedian. His frantic stage act was incredibly inventive. He was also part of the ensemble of the reboot of Laugh-In , but it wasn’t until he appeared on Happy Days that things really took off. \n\nHow It All Began \n\nMork has a few famous names in his background: Dick Van Dyke, Jerry Paris, Garry Marshall (and his son, Scott), and Star Wars . \n\nFlashback to the 1960s and The Dick Van Dyke Show and the famous episode “It May Look Like a Walnut,” a science-fiction dream of Rob Petrie (Van Dyke) about aliens visiting him at home and work. That episode was directed by Jerry Paris (who also played his neighbor, dentist Jerry Helper, on the show). In the 1970s, Paris became a director on the series Happy Days , and had an idea to revisit the alien premise on that show. \n\nIn 1977, Star Wars was a huge hit, and Happy Days creator/producer Garry Marshall’s son was a fan. He was such a fan that he begged his father to make a TV show about an alien. \n\nThe two ideas came together as one and began to take shape. \n\nWho should play Mork, and how did Robin Williams get the part? \n\nWe all know that Robin Williams eventually got the job, but as with most TV characters, there are always some actors that don’t get—or turn down—the role. \n\nCould you imagine Dom DeLuise, or Roger Rees as Mork? Well, they were in the running for the role early on, but for various reasons didn’t work out. \n\nAn associate producer for Happy Days had seen a stand-up performance of Robin Williams—in which he did an alien routine—and suggested him. \n\nAt his audition, Garry Marshall asked Robin to take a seat. Robin turned around, bent over, and “sat” on his head with his rear end up in the air. That sealed the deal. He was Mork. Marshall is later quoted as saying that Williams got the role because he was the only alien that auditioned for the role. \n\nMork and Happy Days \n\nThe first time we meet Mork, he comes to Milwaukee to collect a “hum-drum” human specimen to take back to Ork. That “hum-drum” human was going to be Richie Cunningham. The plan was stopped by Fonzie. At the end of the episode, we find out that it was just a dream. \n\nThat episode and Mork proved to be so popular with viewers and the network, that the idea to give Mork his own show was born. Subsequent re-runs of the episode were changed to show that it was not a dream. \n\nAt the end of the first Mork and Mindy episode, Mork tells Orson (the disembodied voice he reported to) that he had a specimen once (The Fonz), but “had to throw him back, though. Too small.” \n\nClick “next” below to watch some great videos from Happy Days , Mork and Mindy , and a couple of surprises. \n\nMork meets The Fonz \n\nRobin Williams made his “Mork” debut on Happy Days . \n\n[embedded content] \n\nMork confronts Fonzie \n\nMork battles the ultra-cool Fonz. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nMork and Mindy Theme \n\nThe full-length opening from season one. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nMork meets Laverne for a blind date \n\nThe Fonz sets up Mork with Laverne DeFazio. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nThe Mork & Mindy, Laverne & Shirley, and The Fonz Hour \n\nThe opening sequence from the Hanna/Barbera cartoon series of the 80s. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nMork’s Mixed Emotions \n\nAfter a kiss from Mindy, Mork’s emotions go haywire. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nMork’s report to Orson \n\nMork tells Orson about emotions. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nJonathan Winters is Mindy’s Uncle Dave \n\nIn the third season, Jonathan Winters guest-starred as Mindy’s Uncle Dave. \n\n[embedded content] \n\nMork saves the eggs \n\nMork came to Earth in an egg.

0791_33a45327-bb37-4714-8ddb-eb3c4dc0c6bf	Washington (AFP) - A Saudi Arabian detainee said by the US military to have been a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden has been repatriated from Guantanamo Bay after more than a decade behind bars, the Pentagon said Tuesday.\n\nAbdul Shalabi, 39, was first captured by Pakistani forces in December 2001 and was transferred to Guantanamo the following month.\n\nBut in June this year, a review panel "determined continued law of war detention of Abdul Shalabi does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States," Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said.\n\nShalabi, who was a long-time hunger striker, is being released as part of the Saudi government's rehabilitation program for ex-detainees and he will be monitored for years to come.\n\n"The United States coordinated with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure this transfer took place consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures," Cook said.\n\nShalabi's release means 114 inmates now remain in Guantanamo. \n\nPresident Barack Obama has repeatedly demanded the closure of the facility but has struggled in the face of opposition in Congress and from other countries reluctant to take in one-time terror suspects.\n\nAccording to a 2008 Defense Department file on Shalabi, he was captured while attempting to cross the Afghan-Pakistan border after fleeing bin Laden's Tora Bora mountain complex.\n\nHe was captured as part of a group called the "Dirty Thirty," which included other bin Laden bodyguards, the file states.
0792_4bf87dcf-d6ae-4528-8f6f-168703f74a1b	Whatever project you have going on, what would it take for you to complete, round out or get to the next milestone of that project today? \n  \nTurn that project into a product.  A project is something that you're just always tinkering away at, an ongoing venture that is never going to be completed. You need to complete it. \n \nRobert comes across so many people who have websites that aren't done and the reason why is usually pretty silly... \n \n"I need to have one-click upsell in place", or "I need to have this special thing in my member's area." \n \nAsk yourself: Is that really going to make a difference? Is the missing element really going to double your income? Is it worth delaying your income for X number of weeks? Or worse, is it ruining the potential to make income on that product at all? \n \nYou can round-out what you have in the next 24 hours. \n \nWhat if you have an e-book that you planned to be 100 pages but you only had 10 pages completed? What if you just put that out there at this moment? Just about anything you put online, is re-doable. You can edit your sales letter later if you do an expanded version of the book. \n \nPsychologically, it's really important to have something out there right now for sale. \n \nLet's say you have a website with an information product about selling on eBay. You wanted to have a huge 12-part course but right now, you only had time to make 3 parts. Maybe then you edit your sales letter to remove the parts promising Parts 4-12. So, now, just for the time being, it is a ‘beginner' eBay course. Maybe your original intent was to make it $97 but now that it's a fractional part of the entire series that you can market as a Beginner course, you price it at $17. \n \nThere is something very psychologically important about having at least something completed. Now, you just have to go back and complete the rest and edit your sales letter, if you feel like it. \n \nThat's the entire basis of thinking behind Robert and Lance's program called Income Machine . \n "If You Give A Mouse A Cookie"  \nThe plot of this children's book is that if you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to want a glass of milk. If he drinks the glass of milk, he's going to want a napkin to wipe off his milk mustache. Then, he's going to need a mirror to make sure he's wiped it completely off. After looking in the mirror, he realizes he needs a haircut, so then he needs scissors. \n \nIt's about how one silly thing can take you down a very long path where nothing is ever complete. \n The Promise  \nA promise means that you live up to what you told your customer the product is about. \n \nDon't tell your audience that you're going to show them how to create a 5-Minute Video Sales Letter but then spend 90 minutes explaining it. You are going to confuse and frustrate them and lose their attention. \n \nPut yourself in the attendee's shoes. If you "promise" to show them a video sales letter, they want to know what that is. They don't need to know every technical detail. \n How To Rise Above Being A Geek  \nBeing a geek is not just about being a techie who knows A-Z about computers. Instead, it's about being so detailed and over-inclusive of every tiny factor that you exhaust your audience. \n \nHow do you avoid doing this? \n #1: Avoid the "OR" as much as possible.  \nDon't give your audience an endless list of choices. \n \nIf you're teaching a class on podcasting, don't give them a list of 5 microphones they can use. Tell them the one that you personally use. \n \nIf you do that for every single step of your presentation/course, your customer is going to be more confused than when they started. \n \nThat's why in their  Podcast Crusher course, and their  Make A Product course, Robert and Lance say, "Use this one piece of software and you can get fancy later if you want." They're only going to give you one solution for each step. \n #2: Tell Your Customer What They Can Do With the Finished Course/Product  \nGoing back to the video sales letter, show the customer how it is used successfully. \n \nGive a before and after on a site that didn't have a good rate of conversion and after the video sales letter was done, it drastically improved. \n \nThis means that your know what your end game is and what the result will be. In other words, you are ‘promising' the customer what result they are going to have when they are finished with your course. If you know what your end result is, you will know when you get there. \n #3: Have a Superhuman Demonstration  \nThis means that you take something that normally takes "forever" to figure out and compress it into 5 or 10 minutes. That's huge! \n \nWhy only 5 or 10 minutes? Because of people's short attention spans. \n \nGoing back to the video sales letter example, that would take the average beginner days to figure out, learning it on their own, etc. If you say "I'm going to do this really fast. I'm going to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on this and record it in 5-10 minutes from start to finish", that's not something most people can do. \n \nFor one, it will really impress your customers. Secondly, it will give them everything they need to know without confusing and tiring them out. If you tire people out, they miss half of what you're telling them anyway. \n #4: The Easy Button  \nTo rise above being a geek, what can you lay out for someone that is just a no-brainer, no work easy button? \n \nIf you're selling your course on video sales letters, what if you said "I will record your first 5 minute video sales letter for you." Or, that you'll critique it for them. Or, if they create it, you will record a split test. Or, you'll review it and record your version of it to show them possible improvements. \n \nThat might help out some people with their fears and frustrations. \n \nSadly, if Robert asks most people, "What if you sold a $97 course on how to record a video sales letter for your online business, and for that $97, you will also record a 5-minute video sales letter for them?" The average person says, "Forget it. Because if I get 20 sales then I'm going to have to do 20 x 5 minutes of work ." There are a couple answers to this: \n  If you make 20 sales at $100 you made $2000. Not too shabby!  And, a fair estimate is that only 10% of your customers are going to take you up on your offer.  You can also add in a couple of hoops to jump through. For example, "If I am going to record your video sales letter, I am going to need these 10 things from you. (a headline of this, a screenshot of that).  A very small percentage of people are actually ever going to take you up on this.   \nSo, if you sell 20 and only 10% take you up on it, that's TWO people. Now you've done 10 minutes of work for $2000. \n \nWhen you do these above-and-beyond things, this is a chance to get a customer for life. If you end up being flooded with so many sales of your course and you are swamped with all of these video sales letters that you have to create, then it's a good problem to have and it's time to outsource it. \n \nYou could increase your price now to $120 and take that extra $20 from each one and hire a freelancer to create the video sales letter based on the 10 things the customer provided in that checklist. \n Checklist Marketing  \nThis is a way of marketing that shows a path for getting someone to the end point with the use of templates and checklists, something you can create very easily and sell pretty inexpensively. \n \nTo use the example for the course on video sales letters, you present it as "What you want at the end of this course is to have this and this done. When you have these in place, your video sales letter is ready to go!" \n \nPut together a series of steps that someone is going to take from having nothing to being at the end point of that video sales letter. \n \nMake a series of questions that are formatted as "Did you….?" The first 10 questions might be equipment based. Then you have another group based on setup/preparation, etc. etc. You want to do about 30-40 questions in groups of 10. \n \nTo make this process very easy, Robert has a WordPress plugin called WP Notepad that will enable you to set up this checklist/questionnaire and put it on your membership site. The cool thing about this plug-in is that you can "spy on" your members. Don't worry, this isn't nefarious spying! You can pull up an entire screen and see what checkboxes people have clicked on, what parts they filled out, how far along they are, etc. \n \nThis is powerful because you can see where people are getting stuck in your course and you can focus on where you can help people complete it instead of getting focused on geeky little details that people don't care about and that will only discourage and frustrate them. \n The Other Side of the Coin  \nWhile you need to avoid being too geeky and advanced, you also need to avoid being too "basic" about a subject. \n \nNo one wants a course about "Internet Marketing Basics."  The Basics sounds like you're only going to give theory but not any kind of result. \n \nMake it exciting and focus more on the results. People don't want to know all the chemicals and processes that go into building an atom bomb. Instead, they want to know what they can DO with an atom bomb. \n \nRobert's course Income Machine is "secretly" about the "basics" of setting up a list, creating content, starting a blog, running a membership site, etc. but the end goal is that you have all these pieces in place. Yes, it's about learning the terminology but it's also about having everything in place with the end result being a membership site where users can start making money. \n \nYou wouldn't call it "Membership Site Basics." Whew, that's boring. No, you want to focus on the result, which is "Get Your Membership Site Up and Running and Making Money in Three Days!" \n Have a Case Study  \nIf you have a course about creating podcasts, like Robert's Podcast Crusher , you want to actually create a real podcast during that course. \n \nIn other words, don't just give your customers "words." Give them a real-life demo.  There's something really helpful in telling people exactly what you're going to do and then doing an actual real version of it, and not a test. \n \nThen, you can go back to the checklist showing them everything you did together. Now, your customer knows they can apply it themselves.  When you show people something "for real" it makes a lot more sense than just written text or speaking. \n Closing Thoughts   Rise above being a geek.  Avoid the "OR" because that just confuses people.  Have an end goal so you know when it's been achieved and it shows your customers the results that they can have.  Show something simply and "super-humanly" that most people can't do.  Use the easy button.  Have a case Study both in the pitch and in the actual product. It's huge if you can have a "Before and After."   Join Income Machine 2.0 to Claim Your \n All-in-One Money Making System Now
0793_fb7bc824-9f1a-4fb2-973c-22790e8d09ea	By Christine Lagarde \n\nManaging Director, International Monetary Fund \n\nSeptember 25, 2015  \nIntroduction \n \nSecretary-General, Royal Highnesses, Excellencies, Ladies, and Gentlemen—there is an old saying: in unity lies strength. \n \nTwo months ago, in Addis Ababa, the international community put this to the test. We pledged to secure financing to make sustainable development not an ambition, but a reality for all. \n \nToday we face yet another moment of truth as we come together to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals. Our joint success will depend on decisive action and implementation—at both country and collective levels. \n \n1. At the Country Level \n \nCountries can and must act at three levels: economically, socially, and environmentally. \n \nFirst, macroeconomic stability is a pre-requisite for a sustainable economy—but it is not sufficient on its own. While priorities vary across countries, structural reforms and efforts to diversify the economy are often required. Equally, revenue mobilization and efficient, effective public spending—including investment—will be key. \n \nA second priority is inclusion. I affirm that more inclusive growth is also stronger growth—so we must empower people to fulfil their potential. Improving girls’ education and removing barriers to women’s employment and access to finance, would not only boost growth, but also tackle income inequality and poverty. Because let us not forget that poverty and exclusion are sexist. \n \nThe environment is a third priority. Countries have a crucial stake in managing their natural resources efficiently and effectively. At the same time, limiting the harmful impact of economic activity on the environment can and will require targeted interventions. \n \nIn short, each country must do all it can to drive its own development. But durable progress cannot be achieved in isolation—it requires engagement from the international community. So we need collective action. Why? \n \n2. Collective Responsibilities \n \nBecause in today’s interconnected world, for good or ill, cause and effect, spillovers and spillbacks travel across borders, instantly and unceasingly, irrespective of the walls that are being built. And at all levels: \n Macroeconomic stability—where an economic shock in one country wil affect all others;  Inclusion—where social transformations drive the winds of change; and  The environment—where, with global warming, everyone reaps what others have done. \nThe IMF—with its 188 member countries, and 70-year track record of promoting global economic cooperation and stability—understands well the need for, and power of, collective action. \n \nIndeed, the Fund is not only promising action—we are also delivering. In our policy advice, in our research, and our capacity building, we have included social and environmental dimensions that were not there, and we will continue doing so. \n \nWe are also expanding our support for developing countries in several ways: \n One: the poorest countries can now borrow 50 percent more from our interest free faciities;  Two: we are strengthening our technical support to help countries boost domestic revenue mobilization to finance development spending; we are doing that together with the World Bank; and  Three: we are intensifying our support for fragile and conflict-afflicted states. Importantly, we are maintaining, for the longer term, the zero interest rate on our Rapid Credit Facility loans. \nThe IMF is working with its member countries and international partners in the spirit of global cooperation necessary to achieve the SDGs. We have done so, we are doing so, and we will continue to do so. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe esteemed second Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, once said: \n \n“We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours.” \n \nLikewise, the year 2030—the SDGs target date—will one day be upon us, but what it will look like is in our hands. \n \nThank you.
0794_9bdc4fd3-da7b-456b-a264-60bca8d30484	A 24-year-old Danish woman sails refugees across windy straits to safety in Sweden. A Romanian, whose forebears were driven from their homeland, opens his house to today's migrants. A girl brings pens and paper to migrant children sleeping at a Milan train station. \n\nWhile European governments string barbed wire across borders and assail each other over asylum rules, ordinary citizens are taking action to cope with an unprecedented inflow of migrants, their generosity offering moments of hope for the newcomers — and for Europe itself. \n\n"Europe is the baker in Kos who gives away his bread to hungry and weary souls. Europe is the students in Munich and in Passau who bring clothes for the new arrivals at the train station. Europe is the policeman in Austria who welcomes exhausted refugees upon crossing the border," EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said earlier this month. "This is the Europe I want to live in." \n\nLong-established aid groups and freshly created online forums are working collectively and tirelessly to help where governments can't, or won't. But individual acts of kindness are what many migrants will remember, whether they build new lives in Europe or eventually make it back to Syria, Sudan or wherever they call home. \n\nThese are but a few among the many, many people who have stepped out of their daily lives to contribute. \n\nSAILING TO SAFETY \n\n"Welcome. Do you want to go to Sweden?" \n\nAnnika Holm Nielsen and Calle Vangstrup greeted refugees at Copenhagen's main train station with a sign bearing this message, offering to sail them across to Sweden, where asylum policies are friendlier. \n\nIt's just a couple of hours with good winds to Malmo, Sweden, but for asylum seekers, it could be the end of a long and perilous journey. \n\nTheir first passenger was an exhausted Syrian refugee. During the crossing, he was too nervous to eat or sleep, until he arrived within reach of the shore. \n\n"Denmark and Sweden are very much alike, but if you are a refugee it's completely different societies," Holm Nielsen told The Associated Press as she refueled for another journey. "If you are a refugee in Denmark, you are treated as a problem." \n\nMany Danes have helped refugees make it across the border by car, train or boat — despite the risk of being arrested for smuggling. Nielsen and Vangstrup decided to go public to raise awareness and encourage others to do the same. \n\nIn 1943, ordinary Danes helped more than 6,000 Danish Jews to cross the narrow Oresund straight between Denmark and Sweden in boats, after word went around that Nazi German authorities were planning to round them up. \n\nVangstrup lamented rising xenophobic and far right sentiments today in some European quarters. "The world hasn't gotten any better," he said. \n\nRETURNING THE FAVOR \n\nA Romanian student was on the train listening to John's Lennon's "Imagine" when the idea came to him: to welcome Syrian migrants into his family home. \n\nTheir plight reminded Tudor Carstoiu of his own ancestors. His grandfather, great-aunt and great grandparents had been twice forced out of their home in an area of northern Romania occupied by Soviet troops during World War II. \n\nThe family traveled to Poland, Germany and Hungary before settling in Romania. Six years ago, Carstoiu moved to Milan, where he's a graduate student and IT consultant. \n\n"I want the migrants to feel at home in Romania, the way I feel at home in Italy," he told The AP. \n\nThe 26-year-old is among many Europeans whose own families faced persecution or exile, and who are now reaching out to today's refugees. In Croatia, where tensions have soared along the border with non-EU member Serbia, people whose families were forced from homes during the 1990s Balkan wars are among those offering food to migrants. \n\nCarstoiu's offer — and attitude — stand in contrast with Romania's government, which was one of four EU members to vote against a plan last week to share asylum-seekers across the 28-member bloc. There is scant public support for the idea in one of the poorest EU nations. \n\nCarstoiu hasn't settled a family yet in his three-room family home in the small village of Silindia, but he is working on it — he's setting up a non-governmental organization in Italy to coordinate housing and other help for migrants, and wants to reach out to refugees directly via social media or in person. \n\nFittingly, Carstoiu says the house was renovated with money his family won from a Romanian property restitution fund after they sued for the house they lost during World War II. \n\nWhile Romanian politicians fear that migrants wouldn't integrate, Carstiou notes that millions of Romanians like himself have emigrated in recent years, and have largely succeeded in fitting in. \n\nSome political leaders "want to build barriers," he said. "I want to build bridges." \n\nBROKE, BUT OPEN-HEARTED \n\nMany financially-battered Greeks resent the unprecedented numbers of hungry people arriving on their easternmost islands, but many others are reaching out — and opening their pantries. \n\nThere's the baker, mentioned by Juncker, who handed out bread to refugees on the island of Kos. On nearby Lesbos, priest Efstratios Dimou founded and operated a charity providing food, clothing and a place to rest. He died last month, but his charity carries on his work. \n\nIn Athens, refugees sleeping in a city square receive visits daily from residents who bring them something to eat, something to wear. \n\nForeigners are playing a role, too. Eric and Philippa Kempson, Britons living on Lesbos, help bring hundreds of migrants to shore every week, greeting them with water and apples as they reach land. \n\nEric Mills, a California native who now lives in Barcelona, was traveling in Turkey when he realized the gravity of the crisis, and found a way to help on the small Greek island of Symi. He and a friend rose before dawn and spent several hours a day preparing and serving food to hundreds of hungry new arrivals. \n\nHis volunteer spirit awakened, he hopes to motivate friends in the United States and Spain to pitch in, and find ways to subsidize or otherwise help refugees find haven in Europe, "one family at a time." \n\nMOMENTS OF KINDNESS \n\nTargeted help is often the most useful. In the French port of Calais, Brigitte Lips has for years charged migrants' cell phones in her garage. For people living hand-to-mouth in filthy nearby camps, it's a cherished way to stay connected to their families and the outside world. \n\nOthers are setting an example. Finland's prime minister is opening his spare house to refugees on Jan. 1 after his family moves to the official prime minister's residence in Helsinki. \n\nPope Francis' call for help resonated with Polish priest Radoslaw Rakowski in Poznan. "I announced from the pulpit that we want to host a family," he said — and that Sunday, the church collected 24,000 zlotys ($6,500) toward renting an apartment. \n\nA Syrian man living in Poznan has offered to be an interpreter. One family offered to teach them Polish. Another offered to take care of children when parents are busy with administrative visits. \n\nIn the Milan train station, volunteers have been helping migrants since 2013, some staying day and night. Lots of individuals bring donations — including 11-year-old Alice Chiappelli. Worried about fellow children homeless in a foreign land, she brought them paper and pens to pass the time. \n\n___ \n\nAlison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania, David Keyton in Malmo, Sweden, Elena Becatoros in Athens, Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, Colleen Barry in Milan, Elaine Ganley in Calais, Matti Huuhtanen in Helsinki and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed to this report.

Schwartz (euroinfosec) • September 3, 2015 \n\nSony Pictures Entertainment has reached a tentative deal to settle a combined lawsuit, seeking class-action status, filed by former employees in the wake of the massive 2014 hack attack against it, and accompanying data breach. \n\nSee Also: Tackling Cloud Infrastructure Security: Merits of the New Model \n\n"On September 1, 2015, plaintiffs and SPE reached an agreement in principle to settle all of the claims of the putative class against SPE, subject to final documentation, which will be submitted for the court's approval," says a Sept. 2 court filing by the plaintiffs' lawyers. Details of the tentative agreement were first reported by Hollywood news site Deadline. \n\nA motion filed by former Sony employees Ella Carline Archibeque, Marcela Bailey, Michael Corona, Joshua Forster, Michael Levine, Christina Mathis, Steven Shapiro and Geoffrey Springer says that they will seek preliminary approval of the agreement by October 19. "We believe the proposed settlement is a favorable resolution of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs," attorney Daniel C. Girard wrote in the filing. \n\nFollowing the hack attack against Sony, which came to light on Nov. 24, 2014, at least 10 former Sony employees - starting on Dec. 15, 2014 - began filing breach-related lawsuits against the company on behalf of 50,000 current and former Sony employees. But no details about the proposed settlement have yet been made public, and it is not clear how many of the 50,000 current and former employees it might cover. Neither Girard nor Sony immediately responded to a request for more information about the proposal. \n\nCredit for the Sony data breach - and damaging wiper malware attack that bricked thousands of Sony PCs - was claimed by a group calling itself G.O.P., which came to claim that the attacks were launched in retaliation for the Sony Pictures film "The Interview" and its fictional portrayal of the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The FBI took the unusual step of attributing the Sony hack attack to "North Korea actors." But multiple information security experts have disputed that attribution (see FBI's Sony Attribution: Doubts Continue). \n\nBreach Impact \n\nThe lawsuit filed against Sony asserts that 47,000 Social Security numbers and personally identifiable information for at least 15,000 current and former employees - some of whom had not worked for the studio since 1955 - were stolen by attackers. The lawsuit also reported that some of the breach victims' PII was already being traded on black-market websites and being used by identity thieves, and cited a September 2014 audit by PricewatershouseCoopers, which had warned that Sony's information security and monitoring practices fell below "prudent industry standards." \n\nThe leaked Sony information also included embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, in which they exchanged racially charged communications about President Obama (see Sony Pictures Cyber-Attack Timeline). Pascal resigned from her top-level executive position with Sony in February, reportedly in exchange for a four-year movie production contract with the studio. \n\nSony Has Been Battling Lawsuit \n\nSony has been fighting the class-action lawsuit, while suffering notable setbacks along the way. In June, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted Sony's request to dismiss allegations of breach of contract, and that Sony failed to notify breach victims in a timely manner. But he didn't grant Sony's request to dismiss other parts of the lawsuit, thus allowing it to proceed (see Will Sony Settle Cyber-Attack Lawsuit?). \n\nThat included plaintiffs' allegation that Sony "made a business decision to accept the risk of losses associated with being hacked," and that employees had been required to share their PII - including Social Security numbers, driver's licenses and passport numbers, and medical information - with Sony to receive benefits. Judge Klausner said that had created a "special relationship" between Sony and its employees that could make the studio financially liable for having lost control of that data. \n\nIn August, Sony filed a motion opposing the plaintiffs' request that their lawsuit be granted class certification. A related hearing was scheduled for September 14. \n\nBut if the proposed agreement is approved, Sony could have the data breach lawsuits filed against it settled before the one-year anniversary of the attack against it. \n\nAbout the Author \n\nExecutive Editor, DataBreachToday & Europe \n\nSchwartz is an award-winning journalist with two decades of experience in magazines, newspapers and electronic media.

Click here \n\n. \n\nSIMI VALLEY, CA, September 17, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) - Hillary Clinton should be asked if she supports the practices depicted in undercover videos of Planned Parenthood selling aborted babies' organs - and if not, why she refuses to defund them, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said at the CNN presidential debate last night. \n\nIn his strongest language on the issue to date, Christie said that Republicans should not be asked about why they wish to deprive the abortion industry of $500 million a year in taxpayer funding. \n\n"Let's ask Hillary Clinton," Gov. Christie said. "She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts in a way that maximizes their value for sale, for profit." \n\n"It is disgusting," he said, "and the American people need to hear" her explanation. \n\n"We shouldn't be fighting with each other," he said. "She's the real opponent. She's the real problem." \n\nHe also said Congressional leaders were "giving the president a pass" by refusing to defund Planned Parenthood, since Barack Obama has said he would veto any such legislation. \n\nSAN FRANCISCO, September 16, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) - All the undercover video footage of Planned Parenthood's harvesting and sale of fetal organs will be released, even if the Center for Medical Progress has to appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, its attorney tells LifeSiteNews. \n\n"The National Abortion Federation is seeking to suppress [CMP Lead Investigator] David [Daleiden]'s ability to communicate. It's an attempt to get a gag order," says Tom Brejcha of the Thomas More Society, a public interest law firm in Chicago. \n\n"They want to put him in jail. They want to destroy him financially," he says. \n\nNAF, which Brejcha calls an "abortion industry trade group," has sued to prevent the pro-life organization from releasing any further videos of its 30-month investigation -- and to force the group to take down all existing footage from the internet. \n\n"They're really pursuing the case in a very nasty way," he says, accusing CMP investigators of perpetrating a "crime spree." \n\nThe abortion industry has filed "a humongous case...involving 13 claims" that CMP violated the federal RICO law and "various provisions in California law." \n\nCMP in general and Daleiden in particular "broke no laws" and "consulted with experts before he began his 'Human Capital' project." \n\nThe group's lawyers have asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to halt the discovery phase related to NAF's lawsuit. \n\nDepending on how the notoriously liberal court rules, CMP "may go up to next step, to the U.S. Supreme [Court] in the next several weeks," Brejcha tells LifeSiteNews. \n\nThe lawyers and the public are not the only ones interested in looking at CMP's undercover videos of Planned Parenthood executives discussing the benefit of "fetal tissue donation." Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-UT, has issued a subpoena for the full, uncut footage, possibly leading to further Congressional action against the nation's leading abortion provider. \n\nIf NAF succeeds in stifling…

0798_5821a668-6fbd-4467-b8d2-f00751d1bc47	Arrived at the McHenry County Board’s Law and Justice Committee a little late on Monday. \n \nDiscussion was taking place about the collective bargaining agreement between Circuit Clerk Kathleen Keefe’s office and its union. \n \nKathleen Keefe and Scott Hartman \n \nHere’s what the County Board members read: \n \nThe Collective Bargaining Agreement between the MAP, the County and the Circuit Clerk expired on November 30, 2014. \n \nPursuant to good faith negotiations regarding wages, benefits and terms of employment, the parties have reached tentative agreements for a successor labor contract. \n \nThe contract will have a term of four years beginning 12/1/2014 and sets wage increases at 2.25% for each year. \n \nThe contract also sets the starting wage for new Court Room Specialist 1 employees and provides an equity adjustment to employees based on their tenure and position. \n \nThe health insurance language has been revised to provide for a gradual increase in employee contributions each year of the contract and includes an ACA / “Cadillac plan” provision. \n \nOther key changes include revisions to vacation usage, personal day scheduling, funeral leave policy and the incorporation of a new wellness benefit provision. \n \nWhile not included in the contract, the negotiations will enable the Circuit Clerk to implement a change in the department’s personnel policy to address attendance and give the Circuit Clerk greater control of employee absences and use of sick leave. \n \n“We struggle to keep Court Specialists, Circuit Clerk Kathleen Keefe told the committee. \n \n“I have lost them to pretty much every department in the county.” \n \n“Employees start at $12.25 now,” she explains. \n \n“The starting rate would be frozen in the contract until 2017. \n \n“New hires started at $11.90 in 2011, $12.05 in 2012 and $12.25 in 2013. \n \n“So the $12.25 starting rate that has been in their existing contract since 12/1/2013 would be frozen until 12/1/2017.” \n \nKathleen Keefe meets with the Law and Justice Committee. \n \nDeputy County Manager Scott Hartman fills us in on the cost of the contract: \n \n“In consideration of the wage adjustment coupled with the corresponding FICA / IMRF costs, less the calculation of projected health insurance savings (based on current participation levels at today’s premium rate), the contract is projected to cost $175,540. \n \n“This is based on a c \n \nalculation of $236,259 in wages/FICA/IMRF and a savings of $60,719 in Health Insurance costs.” \n \nThe post Circuit Clerk’s Union Contract Clears Committee appeared first on McHenry County Blog .
0799_1343d41b-fb37-409e-8b06-4b64616a8bd8	SOUTHINGTON —Motivational speaker Duane Cashin will provide tips to local businesses on growing their sales at a business forum Sept. 15 at The Ridge Club. \n  \nThe hour-long event, titled “Building a Pipeline of Sales Opportunity Business Forum,” will begin with registration at 7:30 a.m., followed by a buffet-style breakfast at the golf club at 300 Welch Road. \n \nThe forum is hosted by the Southington Economic Development Department in conjunction with the Southington Chamber of Commerce and sponsored by Liberty Bank and Emendee Technologies. \n \nCashin’s presentation will begin at 8 a.m. and will include a question-and-answer session. Town staff will be on hand to answer legal and permitting questions. \n \nChamber of Commerce board member and Town Councilor Dawn Miceli, who helped to organize the event with fellow board members Rob Flood and Al Monbaron and Town Economic Development Coordinator Lou Perillo, said Cashin will “provide practical tips that can be immediately implemented by business owners, CEOs, sales managers, sales professionals and more to help drive revenue and gain a competitive advantage to achieve extraordinary sales results.” \n \nCashin is based in Bristol and gives lectures throughout the U.S. After hearing him speak at another event, Flood recommended him for the forum. \n \nMonbaron, a real estate agent with Century 21 Allpoints Realty, said the idea for the forum was born from the ashes of the chamber’s monthly round-table discussions. \n \n“Their purpose was educational and informational sessions for chamber members,” he said. “However, after a year, meetings were struggling to remain relevant and attendance was starting to wane. I brought my concerns to the rest of our board and we decided to table the meetings while we re-strategized. Dawn spoke with some folks on the town side who were also interested in doing some educational business meetings and had organized one a couple years ago.” \n \nMonbaron said the biggest difference between the business forum and the round-table discussions is the amount of resources available. \n \n“We are now able to commit more to the meetings and bring in quality outside speakers,” he said. “Working with town gives us more leverage as far as attracting the most bang for our buck.” \n \nMiceli, Monbaron and Chamber President Elizabeth Francis encouraged all local business owners, CEOs, sales managers and sales professionals to attend the event, which as of last Tuesday had 70 businesses as registered guests. \n \n“I don’t see any downside,” said Miceli. “It’s a free forum, it’s going to give really pointed pieces of information that will help your business with the bottom line and building sale opportunities and it includes breakfast all for an hour of your time. It behooves every biz to attend.” \n \nMiceli added that additional business forums are being planned for Jan. 12, April 26 and June 14, 2016. \n \nLocal businesses are invited to send two representatives to the forum at no cost. Additional guests are $15 each. \n \nTo reserve seats for your business, email kellyc@southington.org or call (860) 276-6246 for more information. \n \nBrian M. Johnson can be reached at (860) 973-1806 or bjohnson@bristolpress.com \n \n.
0800_7c6952eb-2650-40c6-bf75-9ffd0b19f812	Mohammed Ali Zonoobi bows his head as the priest pours holy water over his black hair. “Will you break away from Satan and his evil deeds?” pastor Gottfried Martens asks the Iranian refugee. “Will you break away from Islam?” \n\n“Yes,” Zonoobi fervently replies. Spreading his hands in blessing, Martens baptises the man “in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.” Mohammed is now Martin — no longer Muslim, but Christian. \n \nZonoobi, a carpenter from the Iranian city of Shiraz, arrived in Germany with his wife and two children five months ago. He is one of hundreds of mostly Iranian and Afghan asylum seekers who have converted to Christianity at the evangelical Trinity Church in Berlin. \n \nLike Zonoobi, most say true belief prompted their embrace of Christianity. But there’s no overlooking the fact the decision will also greatly boost their chances of winning asylum by allowing them to claim they would face persecution if sent home. Martens recognises that some convert in order to improve their chances of staying in Germany — but for the pastor motivation is unimportant. Many, he said, are so taken by the Christian message that it changes their lives. And he estimates that only about 10% of converts do not return to church after being christened. \n \n“I know there are — again and again — people coming here because they have some kind of hope regarding their asylum,” Martens said. “I am inviting them to join us because I know that whoever comes here will not be left unchanged.” \n \nBeing Christian alone does not help an applicant, and chancellor Angela Merkel went out of her way this week to reiterate that Islam “belongs in Germany”. But in Afghanistan and Iran, for example, conversion to Christianity by a Muslim could be punished by death or imprisonment, and it is therefore unlikely Germany would deport converted Iranian and Afghan refugees. \n \nNone will openly admit to converting in order to help their asylum chances. To do so could result in rejection of their asylum bid and deportation as Christian converts. Several candidates for baptism at Martens’ church would not give their names out of fear of repercussions for their families back home. \n \nCongregation member Vesam Heydari initially applied for asylum in Norway and converted there in 2009. But his case was rejected because the Norwegian authorities did not believe he would be persecuted as a Christian in Iran, so he moved to Germany to seek refugee status — and is awaiting a decision. \n \nHe criticised many of the other Iranian church members, saying they were making it much harder for “real, persecuted Christians” like himself to get approved for asylum. \n \nMeanwhile, as other churches across Germany struggle with dwindling numbers of believers, Martens has seen his congregation swell from 150 just two years to more than 600 parishioners now — with a seemingly unending flow of new refugees finding the way to his congregation. \n \nSome come from cities as far away as Rostock on the Baltic Sea, having found out by word-of-mouth that Martens not only baptises Muslims after a three-month “crash course” in Christianity, but also helps them with asylum pleas. \n\n© Irish Examiner Ltd.

The rumour was that Sussanne was ready to tie the knot with someone who was described as Hrithik Roshan‘s ‘best friend’. Her mother, Zarine Khan has jumped to her daughter’s defense and spoken to Pinkvilla about this piece of gossip.\nThere is not an iota of truth in this news, my daughter is not getting married. There is no man in her life. We don’t know, who, time and again keeps spreading these rumours. We are in a very sad state wherein we can’t say yes or no. It is a sad place to be in this film industry. When we try to say something, something more gets splashed all over. Now we just want to keep quiet. Sussanne is working very hard. She is happy with her life. She is bringing up her two kids single-handedly.\nZarine has, in the past, spoken about how Hrithik will always remain a son for her. There have been reports of Sussanne seeing Arjun Rampal, but both parties have vehemently denied the existence of any such relationship. So I guess, Sussanne ain’t getting married any time soon!

0803_1fdc1333-5076-43c2-83c9-b95d20612670	A LUXURY wedding venue has been forced to use silent fireworks after a particularly noisy display caused a dog to have a seizure and sent debris flying into neighbouring gardens. \nThe £6,000 gardens at Kilver Court in Somerset offer couples "the perfect countryside setting for wedding receptions and civil ceremonies". \n\nBut guests will now only be allowed to have pyrotechnics if they make no noise after a handful of complaints from locals. \n\nHorrified resident Kayley Ashman said: "They were very loud and the remains were landing in my aunty's garden. \n\n"Thank god they missed the hot tub." \n\nMeanwhile Josephine West, who called the police following the display, said: "I'm so glad they have pulled their finger out, it was totally out of order. \n\n"The debris from the shells that hit my house, car and lorry were big. Let alone the seizure it caused my dog to have." \n\nBut numerous locals have jumped to the defence of the venue - arguing that the fireworks are popular in the town and should not be scrapped. \n\nPeter Stratford said: "It would appear again that the minority voices of several people has once again been taken into account resulting in this knee jerk reaction. \n\n"The vast majority of people who do not feel the need to resort to social media would not appear to be concerned by the displays." \n\nWayne Frapple also jumped to Kilver Court's defence. \n\nHe said: "Pretty sad when people can't choose to celebrate their special day whether it's a wedding, birthday or anything else the way they want. \n\n"Who celebrates with silent fireworks?" \n\nA spokeswoman for the venue said: "Kilver Court acted in the best interest after an exceptionally loud firework display. \n\n"It was very loud and so we quickly acted to prevent that from happening again." \n\nAvon and Somerset Constabulary refused to comment on the case.
0804_b1877f8c-b862-4e1b-88ea-722e515c7d58	THERE is no player at the highest level of tennis who knows Roger Federer better than Stan Wawrinka and the Swiss No 2 believes his Davis Cup colleague is playing better than for many a year. \n \nWawrinka, who has won two of the last seven Grand Slam tournaments, became the latest player to be brushed aside by Federer as the 33-year-old swept into today's US Open final against Novak Djokovic. \n \nFederer's 6-4 6-3 6-1 semi-final victory over Wawrinka in the semi-finals here on Friday night was another stunning demonstration of the 17-times Grand Slam champion's enduring brilliance. \n \nFederer was in superb form at Wimbledon, where he destroyed Andy Murray before losing to Djokovic in the final for the second year in a row, but Wawrinka believes he has since gone up another gear. \n \nIn winning the Cincinnati Masters and reaching the final at Flushing Meadow his only tournaments since Wimbledon Federer has played 28 sets and won them all with a brand of attacking tennis reminiscent of his heyday between 2006 and 2009. \n \n''He came back at Cincinnati at a completely different level,'' Wawrinka said. ''Here also. He was playing well in the first part of the year and he made the Wimbledon final, but since then he has been amazing. If he keeps at this level he's going to be tough to beat. \n \n''He's moving really well, for sure. He's reading the game well and he's really trying to stay on the line, not to go back. He's staying really aggressive. He's serving really well too. He's serving better than I have ever seen him serve.'' \n \nThe key to Federer's recent run has been his renewed emphasis on attack. He has been playing more serve-and-volley, is moving into the net at every opportunity and is rattling through his service games as if he had a train to catch. \n \nHe has also come up with a new shot, labelled by his entourage as the SABR (''stealth attack by Roger''). Several times in matches he charges forward to the service line when receiving second serves to hit half-volley returns. The tactic usually hurries the server into attempted passing shots that fly wide or long in the knowledge that Federer is likely to pick off any other shot with a winning volley. \n \n''I'll use it in the final,'' Federer promised. ''I used it to great effect against [Djokovic] in the tough situation, at, was it, 4-1 in the breaker in [the final in] Cincinnati. It's got to be the right point, the right frame of mind and the right place to do it.'' \n \nDjokovic, whose form since Wimbledon has been much more patchy than Federer's, also reached today's final in impressive style, though Marin Cilic, the defending champion, was carrying an ankle injury in his 6-0 6-1 6-2 semi-final defeat. \n \nSince the demise of Rafael Nadal, the Federer-Djokovic rivalry has become the headline act in men's tennis. Federer has won 21 of their 41 meetings, but Djokovic has the edge in Grand Slam encounters, having won seven and lost six. Since Federer beat Djokovic to reach his last US Open final Djokovic has won six of their eight meetings in Grand Slam events. \n \nDjokovic has reached the final in 16 of the last 21 Grand Slam tournaments and won the title in eight of the last 19. He will be appearing in his sixth US Open final, though he has won the title only once. Federer will be playing in his seventh, but his first since his defeat by Juan Martin del Potro in 2009 ended his run of five successive victories in the tournament. Victory today would see Federer become the first man in the Open era to win this title six times. \n \nFederer said that some of his greatest opponents - most notably Nadal - had forced him to change his game, while his rivalry with Djokovic was ''more straightforward''. Federer explained: ''I feel like he doesn't need to adjust his game as much either. I think it's just a straight shoot-out, and I think that's the cool thing about our rivalry. It's very athletic. We both can handle whatever we present to one another and I think our matches are very even.'' \n \nWhen asked about Federer's SABR shot, Djokovic did not sound particularly impressed, saying he had not considered copying it. ''He tried that in Cincinnati,'' Djokovic said. ''It worked a couple of times. It's an exciting shot for him. For the player [on the] opposite side of the net, not so much. I have nothing else to say about that.''
0805_5d14a526-0095-4899-9b77-5d840948e55d	Last year, Jeff Daniels completed his run as thoughtful, nonsense-averse anchorman Will McAvoy on HBO’s “The Newsroom” — and was idiot Harry again in “Dumb and Dumber To.” \n\nThis season he’s back to playing smart guys in two highly anticipated films: Ridley Scott’s star-studded adaptation of Andy Weir’s bestselling novel “The Martian” in theaters Oct. 2, and real-life business executive John Sculley in Danny Boyle’s “Steve Jobs” out on Oct. 9 with a script by “Newsroom” creator Aaron Sorkin. \n\nYou can tell that they’re both intelligent guys because they say “no” a lot. \n  \n“Apparently, I’m the head of NASA,” the veteran actor, known for his singular ability to portray the process of thinking on screen, says about his “Martian” role. “There’s some trouble in the sky — Matt Damon’s got a little problem on Mars — and I’m down on Earth shepherding the government’s effort to try and save the day.” \n\nWhile Daniels’ team at Mission Control, which includes Chiwetel Ejiofor and Kristen Wiig, weigh a bunch of bad options, Damon’s fellow astronauts (Jessica Chastain and Michael Pena among them), who mistakenly left him for dead on the Red Planet when they evacuated from a storm, plot an unauthorized rescue mission. \n  \n“I’m also the guy that’s got to say no, too,” Daniels acknowledges, “that it’s much better to let one go and not risk the lives of eight others. So you see that kind of decision-making going on a lot. It’s about Mars and space travel, which I personally don’t know anything about, but you become a guy who does and you think like a guy who does. That’s the fun of acting.” \n\nDaniels ain’t no Silicon Valley CEO, either, but he met with the real Sculley — whom Jobs brought in from Pepsico to run Apple during a shaky period in the computer company’s history — to get some idea of what it felt like when the two business giants fell out over which direction to take with what is now America’s richest corporation. \n  \n“It’s a tragedy in three acts for John,” Daniels figures (Michael Fassbender plays Jobs and Seth Rogen is Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in the movie). “At first, it was a bromance between him and Steve. For a couple of years, anyway, it was going swimmingly. But when the company started to get in trouble, the Apple II was the only thing that was selling. Steve had this idea for something called a Mac, but Sculley made the ecision to put the Mac aside and keep pushing the only thing that was making the company money. \n \n \n  \n“It was a corporate business decision that, at that moment, was the right thing to do. And Steve never forgave him for it.” \n\nDaniels praises Sorkin’s screenplay, adapted from Walter Isaacson’s Jobs biography, for giving his Sculley a three-act arc. The actor loves the scriptwriter’s words, and would consider reviving his “Newsroom” character under one condition at this point in time. \n\n“I have been told that on Twitter there have been people calling for Will McAvoy to moderate one of the Republican debates,” he notes. “I might put the suit on for that, if Aaron was writing it. Can you imagine McAvoy asking Trump, ‘Let’s talk about the phrase Fat Pig?’ ”

0807_eeb08852-985a-463a-ac42-f2f34a3e2bb1	Russian warplanes dropped munitions against Islamic State extremist targets in Syria on Wednesday, a US official said, after Russian lawmakers approved a request by President Vladimir Putin to allow the use of military force abroad. \n\nRussia has built up forces on the ground in Syria in an effort to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But the airstrikes mark the start of a new phase of the conflict that posed uncertainties for a US-led coalition that has been conducting military operations for a year. \n\nThe authorisation, which was passed unanimously by Russia's Federation Council, came after a request for military assistance by Mr Assad. \n\nRussia hasn't acknowledged the beginning of any airstrikes, although Syrian activists say they have seen stepped-up bombardment in the suburbs of Homs and Hama. Russian television in recent days has aired footage from journalists embedded with Syrian government forces in the vicinity of Homs. \n\nSergei Ivanov, the Kremlin chief of staff, said Russia's military involvement would be limited to an air campaign targeting Islamic State, also known as ISIL. \n\n"As our president already said, the use of military forces in ground combat has been ruled out," Mr Ivanov said. "The military goal of these operations is exclusively limited to air support for the Syrian government forces in their campaign against ISIL." \n\nThe authorization represents something of an about-face for the Kremlin. The Russian government has until now insisted that it was only sending "military specialists" to assist the training of Mr Assad's military and the delivery of military hardware. \n\nWednesday's resolution comes as a full acknowledgment that Russia is ready to take part in combat operations. \n\nThe Russian government's moves may clear up potential legal ambiguities raised by the deployment of Russian forces abroad. The government says it is acting in accordance with international law by sending forces at the invitation of Mr Assad's government, but some Russian activists have raised concerns about Russia ramping up its involvement in Syria without approving a formal deployment. \n\nMr Ivanov said that thousands of Russian citizens and others from the former Soviet Union are fighting on the side of Islamic State, and that many have returned home, presenting a direct threat. \n\n"The point here is not in achieving any foreign policy goals or satisfying ambitions," Mr Ivanov said. "We're talking exclusively about Russia's national interests." \n\nHe didn't specify how long the military involvement would be. \n\nThe Syrian presidency posted a statement to both its official Facebook page and the official Syrian Arab News Agency on Wednesday that said Mr Assad had sent a letter to Mr Putin requesting the deployment of Russian air forces to Syria. It didn't specify when the letter had been sent. \n\nMr Putin appeared Monday before the United Nations General Assembly in New York where he called for the creation of a broad front to confront Islamic State. \n\nBefore his appearance, Iraq said it had reached an intelligence-sharing agreement with Russia, the Syrian regime and Iran, further solidifying an emerging alliance among the four countries. \n\nPresident Barack Obama says Syria can no longer return to the pre-civil war rule of Mr Assad after years of bloodshed -- a contention that Mr Putin has dismissed. \n\nMr Putin's intervention would be a major complication to Western efforts in the region, where a US program to train moderate Syrian rebels has faltered and a coalition to counter Islamic State has been moving slowly at best.\n\nUS military officials have raised concerns about the possibility of an inadvertent confrontation between Russian and US military aircraft. \n\nGeneral of the Army Yury Yakubov, a senior Russian defense official, said the strikes would be carried out with the assistance of a coordination center in Baghdad set up by Russia, Syria, Iraq and Iran. \n\n"Information about the conduct out of airstrikes will be communicated to American representatives in Baghdad as well," he said. \n\nThe US military's Central Command, which oversees military operations in the region, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nNews of the Russian government's readiness to carry out strikes drew approval from hawkish Russian lawmakers. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a Duma member and prominent nationalist, called the Kremlin's move a "decision of global import." \n\nIf Islamic State is not halted in Syria, Mr Zhirinovsky said in televised remarks, "then it will extend its grip to the south Caucasus and north Caucasus."
0808_2291c412-4fd0-4f5c-b3b5-df5e98cccb45	(CNN) -  \nSecretary of State John Kerry has tapped a former career diplomat as an "email czar" to coordinate the State Department response to the myriad of document requests mostly related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which have strained the department's resources, officials familiar with the appointment tell CNN. \n \nJanice Jacobs will serve as Kerry's State Department's Transparency Coordinator, charged with responding to Freedom of Information Act and congressional requests faster and more efficiently and improving the State Department systems for keeping records. \n\nKerry has sought to balance between trying to ensure the department promptly responds to the various requests without directly undercutting his predecessor and the Democratic party's presidential front-runner. Privately aides say he has been annoyed at the distraction the controversy has caused for his department, which has at times overshadowed his diplomatic efforts. \n\nOne senior official said Jacob's appointment was "born out of frustration" on Kerry's part that the State Department has come under fire by federal judges and members of Congress alike for not being responsive to requests by the public and Congress for documents, particularly over the past six months as questions about Clinton's use of a private email server have prompted an influx of inquiries and lawsuits. \n\nThe official added, "He is also bothered frankly by unfair criticism of some of our public servants that have been working hard without enough resources." \n\nIn July a federal judge lashed out at the State Department for what he called "dragging their feet" by delaying for four years FOIA requests from the Associated Press about Clinton's schedules at State and documents related to Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin's special employment status at State. \n\nBoth Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and Trey Gowdy, chair of the House Select Committee on Benghazi have both accused the State Department of stonewalling document production to their many inquiries. \n\n"Now that the agency is dedicating itself specifically to resolving the backlog of requests, I expect to begin receiving responses to my questions in a rapid fashion," Grassley said in a statement Tuesday. \n\nA spokesman for Gowdy's committee, Jamal Ware, said the appointment reflected an admission by the State Department that it had not been complying with the group's information requests. \n\n"Adding another person to State's bureaucracy to address the problems caused by former Secretary Clinton's unusual and unprecedented email arrangement will mean little if State does not address the obstacles that currently exist with its compliance," Ware said. "The proof will be in timely production, not late promises." \n\nOfficials say Kerry tapped Jacobs for her experience in leading reform efforts. As Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services in 2002, she was at the center of a major effort to revamp visa issuance policies and how the State Department shared information with law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The State Department was under pressure at that time to show it could prevent terrorists from entering the country with valid U.S. visas in the future, which led to historic changes in Jacobs' office. \n\nShe would later become Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs in 2008, until she retired last year. In that post, she was tasked with clearing up a backlog of passport applications following new requirements for travelers entering the US by air to have passports. The record number of applications led to a massive backlog that caused long delays for millions of Americans attempting to travel abroad. \n\nOfficials said a "large volume" of the FOIA requests and congressional inquiries over the past six months have been related to the widening controversy over Clinton's email usage. \n\nThe ever-increasing number of requests and investigations, they say have put a burden on State Department personnel. In addition to bureaus who need to vet the emails for possible redactions, legal advisers and other personnel have also been brought in to deal with various lawsuits that keep growing. \n\nSeparate from the Clinton email release, the department is the defendant in more than a dozen other FOIA lawsuits relating to Clinton's tenure, with additional document production deadlines to meet for those requests. \n\nRequests are also now piling up for documents from her former aides. In addition, the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission has tasked the State Department for all documents related to Libya over a several year period -- a request that officials say could take years. \n\nIn May John F. Hackett, the Acting Director of the Office of Information Programs and Services wrote about the problem in a letter. \n\n"Even though we are trying to be responsive, there is still a perception we aren't cooperating because when one is closed out there is a new one," another official said. "This is a problem that just builds on itself. " \n\nIn instances where the State Department has met its document release obligations, the review process itself has come under criticism for failure to redact certain sensitive information, including information from foreign government sources, which some in congress and the broader intelligence community say should be classified. \n\nThe State Department has been working in conjunction with a team of intelligence community personnel to vet Clinton's 55,000 pages of emails ahead of their public release, making redactions and classification upgrades as they go. In July, the State Department fell behind in meeting its monthly production quota set by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, but reviewers made up the deficit in August and ultimately exceeded their goal by releasing more than 25% of the former secretary's total email trove. The senior official said Kerry hoped Jacob's appointment would give "new energy" to that effort. \n\n"There is a lot of red tape we need to clean up," the senior official said. "We need someone to cross cut the agencies and bureaus, get information cleared as soon as possible and tie this together." \n\nThe volume is not just related to the Clinton documents, however. State Department officials say FOIA requests for documents have tripled since 2008 and that the small State Department office which processes the requests is ill-equipped to deal with the volume. As a result, the senior official pointed to a "stove-piping of requests that has not led to efficiencies." \n\n"Secretary Kerry's view is that the FOIA process is overwhelming and not properly resourced. The result has been a fairly sclerotic process and he wants to get someone in here working through all this." \n\nIn addition to ensuring documents are provided to Congress and released publicly in a timely manner, Jacobs will be expected to work with other agencies and the private sector to implement best practices and new technologies to improve the State Department's systems. \n\n"This can't be done with just a band-aid or piecemeal," a third official said. "We need to be doing things in a better way."

Fox News anchor Shepard Smith, who has attacked Davis on the air, has regularly spouted pro-homosexual views on the air, such as when he denounced Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day as the “National Day of Intolerance.” The outburst was triggered by a Chick-fil-A executive speaking out against gay marriage.

0811_aec7e794-cead-4634-8a0e-c66b8961b7f6	Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) - Britain's Jenson Button said Thursday that his sense of joy in Formula One had disappeared as rumours swirl that the former world champion is set to retire from the sport.\n\nRefusing to be drawn on the speculation that he had failed to secure a contract extension with underperforming McLaren, Button told reporters in Japan: "I don't like finishing 14th, I don't like finishing 10th. That's not what excites me."\n\nThe 35-year-old, who captured the world title in 2009, has endured a hugely frustrating season because of his car's unreliable Honda engine, and was forced to retire in Singapore last weekend.\n\n"I don't think any driver has joy when they're not fighting for victories," said Button before this week's race in Suzuka. "That's what we're here for, that's what we love -- the challenge of fighting at the front.\n\n"There are so many possibilities of what could happen next year, so may possibilities," he added. "But I can't give you anything else really since the last race. There's no more information to give you so you're going to have to wait a little longer, I'm sorry to say."\n\nWith McLaren in crisis, talks with team boss Ron Dennis have not progressed as hoped, raising the possibility Button could bring the curtain down on a 16-year career which has brought him a world title, with Brawn, and 15 victories in 278 races.\n\nBut Button, who made his F1 debut for the Williams team in 2000, insisted McLaren's issues could still be resolved, despite there being no clear sign that next year's model would offer him and Spanish team-mate Fernando Alonso any improvement.\n\n"We are in good talks, the team and myself and that's it," he shrugged. "If you see a future then there's the possibility of joy coming back and that's exciting. But after the Singapore Grand Prix I wasn't joyful, no."\n\nFlanked by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, fresh from victory in Singapore, Button was hoping for better fortunes in an emotional Japanese race a year after a horror crash suffered by Frenchman Jules Bianchi, who later died from his injuries.\n\n"We're here to concentrate on this weekend," said Button, who won at Suzuka in 2011 and is married to Japanese lingerie model Jessica Michibata. "It's a big weekend for us in front of Honda's home crowd, at their circuit."\n\nWhen Vettel was asked, somewhat awkwardly, to sum up Button's career, the German waxed lyrical called him a "big character", prompting a cheesy grin from the Briton.\n\n"Thanks mate," joked Button. "I'll start crying in a minute, it's so emotional."
0812_e7d19d96-d95c-40aa-98e9-c1604b713535	John Boehner's resignation last week was certainly a triumph for the American people. Why? Because pressure from the American people ultimately led to that resignation. Although we will never hear that explanation, it's the truth. \n   \nThis is a man who has – through his negotiations – continued to fund the agenda of the Democrats, increasing the debt by $4 trillion under all his so-called spending "deals." That is a little less than half of all the debt we had in this nation before President Obama was elected. \n \nCould John Boehner have stopped all that prolific debt increase? Probably not. And trying to stop it would have required strong leadership (which isn't currently present). President Obama presides over the executive branch but Boehner holds the purse strings. \n \nLet's not hurry to get excited about Boehner's potential replacement. The problem may not be solved – more than likely his replacement will bring us more of the same. The American people's pressure on the dysfunctional government in Washington needs to stay intact. \n \nHere is something else we must keep in mind: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of August 2015 about 149 million people are working. This includes part-time jobs – we have the largest part-time workforce we have ever had. We also have 93 million unemployed people. That means more than one-third of the people the BLS counts are unemployed. They argue that many of those unemployed people have merely retired. \n \nWait a minute! Are they have retired, or have most just dropped out?  The unemployed are only counted when they are applying for jobs. And consider this: the BLS uses a population count of only 250 million even through the Census Bureau puts that number at 307 million. \n \nJohn Boehner's legacy touches our lives in many ways. For example, his willingness to continue funding the murder of babies. And his participation (remember, he is the keep of the purse strings) in diminishing our military might.

Just when you thought you never had to hear from the Duggars again, TLC has ordered several specials that will focus on the two oldest daughters, Jill and Jessa, according to The Hollywood Reporter . The girls were two of the victims whom older brother Josh molested. TLC canceled 19 Kids & Counting , the Duggar clan's original reality show, earlier this year after Josh Duggar admitted to molesting several girls in his youth. The specials will follow Jill and her new family -- husband Derick Dillard and son Israel, who was born in April -- as they move to El Salvador to do mission work; and Jessa Seewald, who is expecting her first child with husband Ben later this year. Duggar discord: Has Jessa turned on Josh? This news might explain why Jessa had distanced herself from her brother with Facebook posts that appeared to criticize him. The network is currently planning two or three specials, and hope to air at least one by the end of the year. Last month, TLC ran a special about victims of childhood sexual abuse featuring the Duggar sisters called Breaking the Silence . Are you excited to see Jill and Jessa back on TV, or would you rather never hear from their clan again? WATCH: TLC announces new Duggar specials starring Jessa and Jill

There is a possibility they could play on a line with Connor McDavid, the first pick in the 2015 NHL Draft. EDMONTON -- Edmonton Oilers prospect Kyle Platzer is looking at the Young Stars Classic tournament as an opportunity of a lifetime.There is a possibility Platzer, a center, could play on a line with Connor McDavid, the No. 1 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft."That would be awesome; who doesn't want to play with the kid? He's awesome," Platzer said following physicals Thursday. "I've never met a more humble kid in my life, it's insane. If I met him on the street, I wouldn't even know he played hockey. It's a real treat and he's fun to hang around."Platzer, 20, is one of 26 Oilers prospects in Penticton, British Columbia, participating in the four-team rookie tournament held Friday through Monday. The event includes prospects from the Calgary Flames, Vancouver Canucks and Winnipeg Jets.McDavid will make his first appearance in an Oilers uniform Friday against the Canucks. He is expected to be in the lineup Saturday against the Flames and Monday against the Jets."It'll be fun," McDavid said. "Penticton is part of the process and it's good to finally get it started and I'm looking forward to getting down there."McDavid (No. 1), defenseman Darnell Nurse (No. 2), and center Leon Draisaitl (No. 3) are Edmonton's three highest-rated prospects at the tournament, according to NHL.com.McDavid is expected to be part of the Oilers' opening-night roster and Nurse, 20, and Draisaitl, 19, will challenge for a spot in the lineup."It's a good lead-up for the season, it gets you into game shape and it's a good lead-up to the season; the fans love it," Platzer said. "Obviously with those three going, we're going to have a good team this year."The Oilers have not announced the line combinations for the tournament, but every forward taking part could have an opportunity to play with McDavid."I hope so; we haven't found out our lines yet, but I think it would be pretty special to play with him," center Greg Chase said. "This year with Connor here, the tournament is kind of amped up times 2. It's pretty special to be a part of it and it's something that one day I'll be able to tell my kids that I got to play with Connor McDavid at Oilers camp, which is a pretty cool experience."Chase, 20, is participating in his third Young Stars Classic. The Sherwood Park, Alberta native was selected by Edmonton in the seventh round (No. 188) of the 2013 NHL Draft.Chase met McDavid at Canada's World Junior summer camp in 2014. They also participated in Oilers orientation camp in July."He's been a good friend to me in the last couple of months and we've been texting back and forth all summer," Chase said. "I have nothing but good things to say about that guy, he's a world-class hockey player and even a better guy. You don't see that nowadays and it's something special."Considered the best prospect to enter the NHL since Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2005, McDavid will be the focus at the Young Stars Classic."I've never played in this tournament, I really don't know what to expect," McDavid said. "I'm just going to try and be as good as I can be and just be happy with that."McDavid and Nurse were on opposite sides in the third round of the Ontario Hockey League playoffs, when McDavid and the Erie Otters defeated Nurse and the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in six games."It's certainly better to be on his team than against him," McDavid said. "He's one of the hardest players I've ever played against. I'm happy I'm on his team this week and moving forward, obviously, as well."Nurse is playing in his third Young Stars Classic and hopes to use the experience as a springboard to a strong training camp beginning Sept. 18."It should be fun," Nurse said. "Obviously, [Connor's] excited, everyone is excited to see him on the ice, and it'll be fun to play with him. He's a very dangerous player; you don't get to his position being average. He goes out there and works hard and pushes himself, and it's something all the guys feed off and it's going to be fun to play on his team."

0816_85cbef00-ff5e-4d9b-9e70-602394af940a	, EDT. \n   \nTORONTO - They grew up in the shadow of a throne they were never intended to occupy, then went on to carve unique and revered places in British history. \n\nThey bucked royal traditions by marrying their cousins for love, raised broods of children that thrust them into an unwelcome spotlight, and coped with public criticism about their aloofness and emotional reserve. \n\nBut among the many parallels that exist between Queens Elizabeth and Victoria, one looms larger than the rest — longevity. \n\nOn Sept. 9, the current Queen will succeed Victoria as the United Kingdom's longest-reigning monarch after 63 years and 218 days on the throne. \n\nThe years from 1837 to 1901 when Victoria ruled were markedly different from Elizabeth's era, heralding the United Kingdom's transformation into an industrial and colonial superpower. \n\nThe women who presided over more than half of their respective centuries, however, are strikingly alike. \n\nRoyal commentator Rafe Heydel-Mankoo said the two share similar temperaments and values, something the British public was quick to grasp. \n\nAlthough a teenaged Victoria ascended to the throne after decades of previous scandal-plagued rulers and Elizabeth became queen as a young married woman, he said Britons quickly came to view them in similar lights. \n\n"They brought in a new spirit of hope — Victoria, after all the scandals of her uncles, and Elizabeth after all the problems of the Depression and the Second World War and the post-colonial devastation of Britain and the British economy," he said in a telephone interview from London. \n\n"They both basically offered hope and a new, bright future." \n\nThe two queens led strikingly different lives in early childhood, with Victoria's life rigidly under the control of a domineering single mother and Elizabeth enjoying a more conventional family life with loving parents and an adored younger sister. \n\nThat changed for both after the age of 10, however, when twists of fate decreed that they would each have to assume the throne. \n\nVictoria became heir presumptive after a number of royal deaths left her as the only legitimate member of the family in the line of succession. \n\nThe present-day Queen's fate was decided after her father, George VI, took the throne after it was abdicated by his elder brother. \n\nHistorian Barbara Rusch said both future queens learned of their pending responsibilities as pre-teens, and neither one shied away from the daunting futures before them. \n\nThe then-Princess Elizabeth emerged as a poised public presence at age 14 with a radio address to British children sent away from home at the height of the Second World War. \n\nRusch said the confidence she expressed in that speech with the line "in the end all will be well" was echoed more than a century earlier by Victoria, who greeted the news of her eventual accession to the throne with the declaration: "I will be good." \n\nThey both also showed early signs of tenacity, Rusch said, particularly when it came to their future husbands. \n\nAlthough relatives had more than one prospective suitor in mind for Victoria, she fell hard for her German cousin Prince Albert and wrote rapturously in her diary about her excitement to marry him. \n\nElizabeth had to fight harder to make Prince Philip the future Duke of Edinburgh, Rusch said, adding her parents initially balked at her choice of the dashing naval officer long-rumoured to have a roving eye. \n\nRusch said Elizabeth's parents made her wait a year to see if her ardour cooled before they'd give their blessing to the union. It did not, and historians agree that Philip went on to occupy the place once held by Albert as a central force in a reigning queen's life. \n\nHistorians said both families led comparatively modest lives by royal standards in a bid to be in closer touch with traditional middle-class values. When Elizabeth married Prince Philip, for instance, Rusch said she followed the post-war norms of the day and collected clothing coupons to buy material for her wedding gown. \n\nAlthough both monarchs valued their marriages, historians say that Victoria seemed more emotionally reliant on her husband. \n\nAlbert, who fathered her nine children, virtually co-ruled alongside his wife before his death in 1861. That event, Rusch said, changed Victoria's life and English society permanently. \n\n"It was an obsession, and she created a cult of mourning which extended to the entire empire around her sadness and her loss," she said, adding Victoria ordered hot water and shaving gear brought to her husband's room for years after his death. \n\nThe monarch who once revelled in court social functions and dabbled in amateur painting soon became a recluse, largely withdrawing from public life and earning a reputation of rigid aloofness that has shaped her image in popular culture. \n\nHer reserve did not extend to the political realm, however. \n\nRusch said Victoria's personal journals are filled with clear descriptions of which British prime ministers she did and did not favour. She played a quiet but active role in shaping the politics of her time, he added. \n\nThe current queen has taken the opposite path, said royal historian Carolyn Harris. \n\nElizabeth has always taken her role as a non-partisan constitutional monarch "very seriously," Harris said, adding that her lack of political involvement and unflappable poise have redefined the public image of what a queen should be. \n\n"Because she's been on the throne for so long, her approach has become synonymous with how a constitutional monarch should behave," Harris said. \n\nSuch exemplary behaviour didn't always trickle down to the next generation in either case. \n\nBoth queens had first-born sons whose sexual proclivities and extra-marital antics shone uncomfortable spotlights on lives they preferred to keep private. Their parenting techniques were both questioned in similar ways. \n\nRusch said Victoria's documented remarks describing herself as "no admirer of babies" can easily be compared to video footage of the Queen shaking hands with her four children after being away from them for weeks. \n\nBut public images can be deceiving. Heydel-Mankoo said both women, frequently depicted as everything from stoic to joyless, both had strong senses of humour that didn't always shy away from the off-colour. \n\nHeydel-Mankoo believes the parallels that run through their respective reigns were no accident, saying Victoria's example helped mould the current queen into someone who could carry on the traditions she began. \n\n"Queen Victoria really shaped the idea of middle-class monarchy in terms of its morality and its lifestyle," he said. "One could argue that Queen Elizabeth is the last heir of that tradition." \n\nFollow @mich_mcq on Twitter \n \nContent Provided By Canadian Press.

"I will say, honestly, John and I are having trouble," the wife of John Legend opened up. \n\n"Every single time I sit down for an interview with anybody ... I will say, just being two years into being married, the questions just come from all over," she said. "It's kind of crazy because I can't imagine being that nosy to be like, 'So, when are the kids coming?' because who knows what somebody's going through." \n\n"We would have kids five, six years ago if it had happened. But my gosh, it's been a process!" she added. "We've seen fertility doctors, and then once you open up about all those things to other people you start learning that a lot of other people in your life are seeing these people, and they have this shame about it." \n\nThe 29-year-old model went on, "So, anytime somebody asks me if I'm going to have kids, I'm like, 'One day, you're going to ask that to the wrong girl who is really struggling, and it's going to be really hurtful to them.' And I hate that. So, I hate it. Stop asking me." \n\nTyra Banks also talked about her fertility struggles during the show.

0821_29a7e7b4-7b1a-4b3f-b5ac-306b91d941b1	NIAMEY Niger's former head of parliament and exiled opposition figure Hama Amadou, who is being sought in connection with an investigation into child-trafficking, vowed on Monday to return home to stand in a presidential election next year. \n\nSome 30 members of the country's political and social elite, including Hama's wife, have been charged with acquiring around 30 new-born babies from "baby factories" in neighbouring Nigeria. \n\nHama, once a close ally of President Mahamadou Issoufou but now considered one of his chief rivals in the February polls, fled to France last year before he could be questioned by investigators. \n\nHe has maintained that the case is politically motivated, and on Sunday he was nominated as his MODEN party's candidate for the presidency. \n\n"I will be in Niger. I will participate in the elections, even if I am in prison. I'll be there soon," Hama said in an interview with Niger's Bonferey television channel. \n \nHama finished third in the last election in 2011 and subsequently supported Issoufou in a run-off, helping seal his victory. \n\nHowever, the two men fell out in 2013 over Issoufou's formation of a government of national unity, a decision Hama accused him of taking unilaterally. \n \n"I will be with the opposition and if I finish third once again, I will support the opposition candidate in the second round, whoever that is," Hama said. \n\nIn a recent interview with French magazine Paris Match, Interior Minister Hassoumi Massaoudou said Hama would be arrested if he returned to Niger. \n \n(Reporting by Abdoulaye Massalaki; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Christian Plumb )
0822_51b73d62-27ac-4b75-889a-f4aca77c5c40	By Jack Thurston \n \nIN HIS follow-up to the best-selling Lost Lanes book, Jack Thurston celebrates the very best of cycling in Wales and on the English borders in 36 new routes, from gentle, family-friendly excursions to challenging mountain adventures. \n \nHere, in an exclusive extract for the Worcester News , he describes a circular 46-mile ride on quiet country lanes from the quintessential English market town of Leominster, through the black and white villages of Herefordshire, to the wild and windswept Welsh uplands. \n \nWhen it comes to woodland, Britain is now the bald man of Europe. Once upon a time, vast primeval forests covered almost the whole of the British Isles. \n \nToday trees account for just 12 per cent of the land area, compared to about one-third in France and Germany and a whopping 73 per cent in Finland. \n \nYet Britain is blessed with the lion’s share of northern Europe’s ancient, veteran and champion trees or as 19th century English clergyman Francis Kilvert described them, “those grey, gnarled, low browed, knock kneed, bent, huge, strange, long armed, deformed, hunchbacked, misshapen oak men that stand awaiting and watching century after century”. \n   Promoted stories   \nAs Kilvert would have known, nowhere is Britain’s wealth of ancient trees more evident than in the Welsh Borders. And not just standing tall in the fields and hedgerows, but used in the construction of the half-timbered buildings that are the most distinctive aspect of the local architecture. \n \nThe black and white villages of the Herefordshire/Shropshire border have long been marketed as a tourist attraction, a vision of ‘Merrie England’. \n \nJack said: “I’ve always found this a bit strange since the black and white villages were only painted black and white in the mid-19th century. \n \n“Before that, the timbers would have been left their natural colour or very lightly lime-washed. The walls between would have been the colour of the local clay, ranging from soft pinks to mild ambers. \n \n“There is still plenty of black and white to be found, but many owners of these historic buildings are now reverting to the old ways by revealing the natural hues and grain of the timber and showcasing, all the better, the fine work of the craftsmen who built them.” \n \nThis ride begins in Leominster, a market town whose many fine half-timbered buildings owe their existence to the medieval wool trade that saw the town prosper, literally off the backs of local Ryeland sheep. \n \nTheir soft, short wool, known as ‘Lemster ore’, was highly prized and Queen Elizabeth I insisted on it for her woollen stockings. With the coming of the industrial revolution, Leominster switched from wool to cotton, and more recently it has evolved into the antiques shop capital of the Borders. \n \nThis ride is a loop west to Kington, not far from the border with Wales. To begin, the route follows the course of the River Lugg through Eyton and Kingsland on quiet lanes and the B road to Eardisland, a picture-perfect village astride the River Arrow complete with a moated castle ruin, a couple of pubs, a tea room and a 17th century dovecote that now plays host to a community shop. \n \nIt’s then a back lanes route over the A44 to Pembridge, perhaps the quintessential black and white village, says Jack. Its current population of around 1,000 is half its peak in the Middle Ages, when the town was one of the trading posts where English wool merchants and Welsh sheep farmers would meet to do business in safety. \n \nThe stocky church, with its separate bell tower, hints at the importance of Pembridge in its heyday. \n \nFrom Pembridge wiggly lanes roughly shadow the River Arrow west, picking up the B4355 for the run-in to Kington. \n \nDespite being on the western (Welsh) side of Offa’s Dyke, Kington has been firmly English since before the Norman conquest. The place has a medieval feel and was a staging point for drovers heading east over Hergest Ridge. \n \nHeading west out of Kington, the route traces the ridge’s lower contours. It’s a wild, windswept hill said to be haunted by a ghost dog. \n \nIn the early 1970s the spectral hound was joined by rock multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, who moved here in search of peace and isolation after he found stardom with Tubular Bells. His follow-up album was a paean to Hergest Ridge, where he used to fly his model gliders. \n \nCrossing the River Arrow, it’s a bit of a slog up to the top of Brilley Mountain from where a confusing web of narrow farm lanes leads to Eardisley. This was once a stop on the Hay Railway, a very early horse-drawn goods line that connected Brecon with Kington, and some of the railway buildings remain. \n \nHeading back to Leominster, the route wends its way along lanes through three final black and white villages - Almeley, Weobley (pronounced Web-ley) and Dilwyn. \n \nBest Pubs and Pit Stops Along the Way \n \nRita ’s Tearoom, Eardisland HR6 9BD (01544 388064).Good breakfasts, light lunches and teas. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nNew Inn, Market Square, Pembridge HR6 9DZ (01544 388427).

"He turned up in the garden and I came inside and called the police. While I was on the phone to them he was tearing down the garden. He pushed a 7ft pergola down with his hands. \n \n\n\t"Then I heard this terrible noise - he had actually come into our garden on his JCB and smashed down the chicken house. I didn't know whether they got out or whether he killed them. \n \n\n\t"Then he started dumping piles of rubble. It seemed like it was going on forever but I have no idea how long it actually was. He smashed up all our hard work. We had just made it nice." \n \n\n\tSadly, although the chickens got out, two of them died just days later. \n \n\n\tSimon, who now works part time as a gardener, said: "We wanted to move somewhere nice and tranquil and idyllic - but little did we know." \n \n [Related story: 6 ways to spruce up your front garden and sell your property] \n \n\n\tEver since the garden attack in August 2013, the couple said they have lived in fear of their neighbour. \n \n\n\tThis was heightened when Simon was away caring for his mother in Beckenham while she struggled to recover from the heart attack that eventually led to her death in December, aged 94. \n \n\n\tThe grandparents-of-two and parents-of-four hope the suspended sentence will prevent any further tirades. \n \n\n\tLewis's wife Kamila Lewis, who keeps horses, refused to comment at their home where the offending JCB still faces the Meatons' house. \n \n \n \n\n\tMartin Lewis denied being a "crazed farmer" and said he truly believed it was his land when he tore through his neighbour's garden on his JCB. \n \n\n\tSpeaking as he ploughed a field, he said: "I'm not a blithering idiot or a crazed farmer. I believed the land was mine. \n \n\n\t"I did it. I was wrong. But I acted under the belief it was mine. \n \n\n\t"I'm not an idiot. Who would do such a thing knowing the property belonged to them? It's like putting a noose around my neck." \n \n\n\tLewis, who previously was made bankrupt, says he now works on behalf of other farmers. \n \n Photo credit: SWNS \n \n Have you been targeted by a 'neightbour from hell'?

0827_ab1671a2-c4f3-434c-8b6d-76fb262a6afa	*Dr. Ben Carson may be a lot of things to a lot of people, but supporter of a Muslim as President of the United States is not one of them. \n \nAccording to NBC News , the thought of such of thing does not sit well with the retired neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate at all. \n \n“I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that,” Carson said during an interview Sunday on “Meet the Press,” as he mentioned that Islam, as a religion, is incompatible with the Constitution. \n \nRegarding a president’s faith, Carson stated that a president’s faith should matter depending on what that faith is. \n \n“If it’s inconsistent with the values and principles of America, then of course it should matter,” the Republican presidential hopeful clarified. \n \nCarson’s comments come as he trails Donald Trump , who remains the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination in several polls. While he has attracted headlines for controversial remarks, recent news on Trump stems from him not correcting a man who accused President Barack Obama of being a foreign-born Muslim and called Muslims a “problem” in the United States. \n \nIn Carson’s eyes, he has “no reason to doubt” that Obama was born in the United States and is a Christian, NBC News notes. When asked if he was comfortable with a Muslim being president, Trump, who has challenged Obama on his birthplace and citizenship multiple times in the past, told “Meet the Press,” “It’s something that at some point could happen.” \n \nThe real estate mogul continued, “Would I be comfortable?” he continued. “I don’t know if we have to address it right now.” \n \nTouching on a different issue, Carson weighed in on foreign policy, saying that although he would use “every resource available” when dealing with ISIS in Iraq, he would be hesitant to commit to using U.S. troops in Syria. \n \nInstead, Carson would put his stock in driving ISIS out of Iraq and into Syria, a scenario that would put them solely up against the Assad government. \n \n“I would be in favor of pushing them [ISIS] up into Syria, because there’s going to be a lot of conflict, obviously, with them there,” Carson said. “Let them fight each other.” \n \nTo see arson’s “Meet the Press” interview, check out the video below \n\n  Recent Posts

These "bath salts" were seized in a different drug bust earlier this year. \n             \nWellington police are warning the psychoactive substances ban has resulted in more illicit drugs being ordered online and mailed to our shores after a series of synthetic cannabis busts at the border. \n \nFour people were arrested and charged with drugs importation, possession, cultivation and supply in the Hutt Valley and Porirua after a series of search warrants in those areas last week, police said. \n \nWellington police and Customs had since intercepted drugs at the border, including Class-A drug methamphetamine, synthetic cannabinoid, Ecstasy, and Alpha PVP – also known as "bath salts" – as part of the investigation, they announced on Wednesday morning. \n \nIn recent months the investigation, dubbed Operation Venus, had resulted in the seizure of dozens of small packages bound for addresses across the Wellington District.  \n \nDetective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch, head of the Wellington police organised crime team, warned the drugs-mail tactic appeared to be becoming common. \n \n"Since the increased restrictions of psychoactive substances in 2014 there has been an increase in the unlawful importation of these harmful substances," Leitch said. \n \n"People engaged in such activity cannot hide behind the apparent anonymity of the internet and face the real risk of criminal convictions and possible imprisonment for importing these substances." \n \nMaurice O'Brien, Customs investigations manager, said border security detection systems were "excellent" and they aimed to keep drugs out of the country. \n \nThe haul included "bath salts" – white or pink crystals composed of Alpha-PVP or Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone. \n \nIt comes in crystal form, in tabs or $40 capsules. \n \nThe drug is also known on the street as "flakka" or "niff". \n \nAccording to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, it can produce a state of "excited delirium" similar to a cocaine high, and characterised by hyper-stimulation, paranoia and hallucinations leading to violent aggression or injury. \n \n"Bath salts" have been linked to aggressive behaviour and even deaths overseas. \n \nJet skis, speed boats, a Harley-Davidson and two houses, together worth more than $1 million and  were impounded by Wellington Police after a bust targeting alleged Chinese imports of the drug earlier this year. \n \nThree men and a woman all aged in their 20s faced charges over the imports. \n \nPolice said they are continuing to investigate the imports. \n    \n 
0829_672ebe8e-3495-41ff-a032-9e590f21c039	Lam Duong said he understands the plight of Syria's refugees. Three decades ago, he was in the same situation. \n\nIn 1984, Duong became one of the tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees who came to Canada fleeing the communist government there. \n\nSeeing images of people desperately trying to get out of Syria is a reminder of his own escape. \n\n"I feel very sorry for them. To see that kid die on the beach, me and my wife were brought back to our own experiences," Duong said. "It was similar to that. We feel because we, as refugees by boat, it's really painful seeing that situation." \n\nLike many refugees from Syria, Duong left Vietnam in a boat, spending two years in a refugee camp in Malaysia before coming to Canada. He didn't know any English and needed help finding a job. \n\n"The first time we came to Canada we had to start over," Duong said. "There was a big difference, culture, everything, language." \n\nWith government support, Duong was able to make the transition. Within three years he'd become a Canadian citizen, taking a picture of himself in front of the Ambassador Bridge the day he became a Canadian. \n\nToday, he owns a restaurant in Windsor where he employs his younger sister Yen Duong, who followed him to Canada a few years later. \n\nYen said it took her a little while before she found a solid footing in her new country. \n\n"Everything was new, scary because we had no English at all," she said. "Everything was done by action, we learned step-by-step." \n\nThe Canadian government has promised to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next three years. In the last two years, 2,300 have already been resettled in Canada. \n\nLam said he's hoping the Canadian government will help the Syrian refugees the same way it helped him. If there is a Syrian looking for help, he'd offer them a job in his restaurant. \n\n"We wish the government has an open hand to help them," he said. "I hope they will find a country that will help them. No one wants to escape their country for no reason."

0832_a3938592-e9fa-40dd-a311-3d08f04c128f	When senators run for president, they hold up their voting records. Governors seeking the White House proclaim they produced an economic miracle, cherry-picking data on jobs, budget and taxes.\n\nFour sitting governors, as well as a number of former ones, will participate in one of two events when CNN holds the second round of Republican debates on Wednesday.\n\nThe economy should be a major topic. The four active governors served in good and bad times and were similarly affected by the national economy. The Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of States, which assesses a half-dozen economic criteria, provides a good comparative guide.\n\nBy this measure, the top performer in the field is Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Since 2011, the index shows, Ohio has the 11th best economic performance of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Wisconsin, under Gov. Scott Walker, is 32nd; New Jersey, under Chris Christie, is 39th; and Bobby Jindal's Louisiana is 47th. (North Dakota and Michigan rank first and second.)\n\nDuring Kasich's five and a half years in office, employment in his state has increased 6.5 percent, outpacing the 5.1 percent growth for Walker and 4.5 percent for Christie. In Louisiana, which is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry, employment declined 4.5 percent on Jindal's watch. Personal income also rose more in Ohio - 15.5 percent - than in the other three states.\n\n(Jindal was elected in 2007 and Christie in 2009, and Kaisch and Walker took office at the beginning of 2011. The comparative data cover the period from 2011 to the present.)\n\nThese may be the most politically salient measurements. Other data show more mixed results. Home prices have risen in all four states, the most in Louisiana, probably reflecting the Hurricane Katrina recovery. Mortgage delinquency rates have been cut the most in Wisconsin and Ohio.\n\nOf the four former governors still in the contest, the most notable is Jeb Bush, who served in Florida from 1999 through 2006, when the state experienced an economic boom. Yet a recent analysis in The Washington Post showed that much of the growth was attributable to a "massive and unsustainable housing bubble - one that ultimately benefited rich investors at the expense of middle-income families."\n\nThe other ex-governors, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, George Pataki of New York and Jim Gilmore of Virginia aren't first-tier contenders. (Kasich, Christie, Bush and Walker qualified for the prime-time debate. Jindal, Huckabee and Pataki will be on the undercard.)\n\nBeyond his accomplishments as governor, Kasich may be overstating some of his other economic credentials. He often cites his experience in banking, even though he was employed by Lehman Brothers, which famously collapsed in 2008.\n\nHe also served nine terms in the House of Representatives. He was House Budget Committee chairman from 1995 through 2000, and takes credit for the four balanced budget during the Clinton administration.\n\nRobert Reischauer, a Democrat who was director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995, praises Kasich as a "reasonable chairman." But he says the credit for those surpluses belongs to the 1990 and 1993 budget agreements (which had tax hikes and spending cuts), the end of the Cold War that enabled Congress to achieve spending caps, and the technology fueled economic boom of the 1990s. Kasich's current call for a constitutional amendment to mandate a balanced budget seems specious.\n\nBut his Ohio performance is the real deal. Before Kasich took office in 2011, the jobless rate was above the national average. It is now 5 percent, lower than the national average. First-time jobless claims could reach an all-time low for the state this year. He has championed business-friendly policies, and a record number of businesses were created in Ohio last year.\n\nPerhaps the best indicator is the opinion of voters. In conservative Louisiana, Jindal is more unpopular than President Barack Obama. Walker and Christie both have negative ratings with record levels of disapproval. In Ohio, by two to one, constituents gave a thumbs-up to Kasich.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER\n\nAlbert R. Hunt is a Bloomberg View columnist.

0835_5a926485-5bc6-4767-becf-c6a845eba17a	This is my 200th blog post. (Big whoop!)  Over the past few years this blog site has been revamped several times. It started out as ‘Breakin’ all the Rules’, then changed to ‘The Journey Begins’, and now, ‘Broke Fiction’. The original purpose for the site was to promote my first book and to connect with other creative people, primarily authors. In regards to the latter, I have been lucky enough to meet and speak with a myriad of creative people from all over the world. However, I found out later that Twitter and Facebook are much better than a blog site for connecting with like minded people.  In the beginning, I had a bad habit of posting an article and then I would delete it a couple days later. Reason being, after I reread what I posted, I noticed all the mistakes. Fortunately, I saved all the old post, and I now use them as tools to help me become a better writer. FYI, of all the things I wrote about and posted, I never meant for any of them to be personal. My scribbles have been and always will be for amusement only. Occasionally, I write something that sounds meaningful, but trust me, it's purely accidental.    I suppose if this blog would be compared to the millions of others on the Internet, it undoubtedly would be categorized as a failure. I don’t get many views and rarely, if ever, will anyone ever comment about what I posted. I’m okay with that, and I understand. I’m like sushi, asparagus, and caviar; you either like it or you won’t come within a hundred yards of it.  Now with that out of the way, on to blog post 200! Last night I watched the original ‘Planet of the Apes’, again, starring Charlton Heston. (I think that makes it at least 35 times now.) As I watched, a new thought occurred to me. Why were the apes so concerned about the puny humans? Until Chuck came along, the apes knew the humans were extremely primitive, weaponless, and couldn’t talk. Hunting them would be like hunting a deer with a tank – to easy. The humans were no more than a nuisance then a threat. In addition to all that, ape city appeared to be very small, but yet there were hundreds of apes. Dr. Zaius, all he wanted to do was keep the apes in the dark about the past. He was worried that it would destroy ape civilization if the other apes ever found out what really happened, and so he authorized the capture of humans for science experiments and dissection. (Think aliens visiting earth and the impact it would have on religion in today's world.) The apes could have moved to anywhere on the planet anytime they wanted, and take the puny humans with them as slaves. The apes appeared to be extraordinarily stupid; however, they did have guns, metallurgy skills, agricultural knowledge, and engineering expertise. They also tamed and rode horses, fashioned clothing, and were proficient in medical procedures. Although, with an entire planet to explore, migrating to a more isolated location was completely out of the question all because Dr. Zaius was a moron!     I know that later ape movies explained the back story, but Planet of the Apes as a stand-alone movie was very puzzling to me. Philosophically, I rate this as a 5 star movie, and I consider it to be a handy guide on how to overwhelm the dam dirty apes in the future. Classic Broke Fiction! The more you write, the better you become and evolve as a writer. The best advice I can give to any new writer is to keep writing.   -jk-
0836_3518b59a-ae71-4fe7-9b72-d5d17e42bb87	ANN ARBOR, Mich. — India's largest SUV maker is ready to make its debut on U.S. roads. But it's starting with two wheels, not four.\n\nMahindra hopes to win over city and campus dwellers with a $2,999, Vespa-like electric scooter called the GenZe, which goes on sale this fall in California, Oregon and Michigan. Sales could soon expand to other states and Europe.\n\nIf buyers like it, Mahindra could use the GenZe as a springboard into the car market, just as Honda made the leap from motorcycles to cars here in the 1970s.\n\nThe strategy has some risks. Scooters have never been as popular in the U.S. as elsewhere — people in China buy as many electric scooters in a day as Americans do in a full year, for example. And consumers might not trust Mumbai-based Mahindra, which scrapped an attempt to sell vehicles here five years ago because it couldn't meet U.S. safety standards.\n\n"The pressure has really been on to make sure that we get this right," says Terence Duncan, the head of customer engagement for the GenZe and one of its chief designers. "What we're doing, really, is introducing the brand to American customers."\n\nTo appeal to skeptics, Mahindra designed the GenZe in Silicon Valley with features favored by tech-savvy Millennials, like a secure laptop charging port under the seat. It opened its four stores in San Francisco and Portland because buyers there are more accepting of two-wheeled transportation. In Michigan, buyers can get a GenZe at the Ann Arbor factory where it's made.\n\nThe GenZe only goes up to 30 miles per hour, so riders won't need a motorcycle license. Its most innovative feature is a 28-pound removable battery, which riders can unhook and carry inside to charge. The battery takes 3.5 hours to fully charge, and the scooter goes for 30 miles on a charge. A 7-inch touchscreen display tells drivers their speed and range.\n\nOnly about 5,000 electric scooters will be sold in the U.S. this year, according to Ryan Citron, who analyzes the market for the consulting company Navigant Research. Among them: the ZEV 2700 and the Bravo EVT-168, which cost about the same as the GenZe. By comparison, 30,000 will be sold in Europe and 3.9 million in China, where electric scooters cost less than half the price of a GenZe because they use a cheaper type of battery.\n\nCitron says about 46,000 gas-powered scooters will be sold in the U.S. this year. Any scooter has a tough time selling when gas prices are relatively low, he says.\n\nCitron believes the electric scooter market will grow to around 20,000 annual sales by 2024 as companies like Mahindra and Oregon's Boxx Corp. enter the market. Another one to watch is Gogoro, a Taiwan-based scooter maker that wants to develop stations where riders can swap out batteries.\n\nMahindra is targeting college campuses and also plans to supply scooter-sharing programs like Scoot. So far, it has around 300 GenZe orders from people who paid a $100 deposit. The company expects to make around 3,000 scooters in the first year, Duncan says.\n\nThis isn't Mahindra's first attempt to crack the U.S. car market. The $16.9 billion conglomerate, which controls about 40 percent of the SUV market in India, began courting U.S. dealers about a decade ago with the promise of delivering vehicles by 2009. But Mahindra had trouble meeting U.S. vehicle regulations and canceled its plans in 2010.\n\nMahindra does sell tractors in the U.S., but wants to build its name in urban areas, says GenZe CEO Vish Palekar. So in 2012, it set up a small group in Palo Alto and told them to come up with a vehicle that would get people around cities more easily.\n\n"If we're going to be relevant here, we need to create something transformative," Palekar said.\n\nMahindra hopes that eventually leads to the four-wheel market. It would be logical to target GenZe buyers with vehicles like the Reva e20 electric car, which will soon launch in Europe.\n\nExecutives are tight-lipped about their plans, but Mahindra has already opened a Detroit-area tech center that's working on bringing its vehicles up to U.S. safety standards.

0839_62a4da98-8240-431c-8a8c-01cee51eacde	Honey Brook Borough’s final concert of the season for the free Concert in the Park series will be held Sept. 13. \n  \nBack by popular demand, Across the Pond will perform at 5 p.m. Across the Pond is a multi-instrumental trio performing their own arrangements of Irish and Scottish tunes and songs. \n  \n“This band played for us a couple years ago and drew a very large crowd. I wasn’t sure how traditional Celtic music would be received in this area so I was pleasantly surprised at the response,” said Park and Recreation Chairperson Jeanne Jenzano. “This band is comprised of exceptional musicians who play spirited, high energy Celtic tunes. This concert will be enhanced by the talent of the McDade Cara School of Irish Dance. The dancers will perform to the jigs and reels of Across the Pond.” \n  \n“We are a fine wedding band, concert band, party band, festival band, and more.  We perform traditional Celtic music with our own unique arrangements,” writes the band on their website at http://www.acrossthepodmusic.com. \n \n \n  \n“The sounds of guitar, mandolin, flute, whistles, fiddle and bodhran will surely transport the audience “across the pond”,” touts Honey Brook Borough’s website.  “With repertoire ranging from hauntingly slow airs to high energy jigs and reels, Across the Pond has been recognized as one of the premier Celtic bands in south-central Pennsylvania.” \n  \nAccording to the band’s website, www.acrossthepondmusic.com, Michael Morrison grew up playing bluegrass, old-time and blues guitar, eventually also playing rock and country.  He plays guitar, mandolin, flute, banjo and sings. Chuck Krepley began as a bluegrass banjo player in the 1970s, and eventually Scottish style fiddling. He plays fiddle, banjo and guitar. Dan Diviney has been playing whistles and bodhran at Irish sessions since 1999. \n  \nThe Sept. 13 concert closes out the 2015 Concert in the Park series. \n  \n“This summer’s concert series has been wonderful!” said Jenzano. “We have been lucky to have great weather and good turn out. It’s a great feeling to see Honey Brook residents and folks from other communities all together enjoying great music on a summer evening in the park.” \n  \nHoney Brook Borough will be collecting nonperishable food items for the Honey Brook Food Pantry. \n  \n“Our ongoing collection of nonperishable food has been an added feature this season and we have appreciated the generous donations of our audiences,” said Jenzano. \n  \nThe Park and Recreation Board is already thinking about next year’s concert series. \n  \n“Attendance at the concerts continues to increase and bands are contacting me, requesting to be part of the concert series,” she said. “I have some possibilities for next season in mind and would really like to find a band that plays Motown and Soul music. It’s fun to provide a variety of different musical genres for our audiences, something for everyone.” \n  \nThe Honey Brook Lions Club will have food and beverages available for purchase. Attendees are encouraged to bring picnics, lawn chairs or blankets and enjoy an evening of music in an outdoor setting. \n  \nIn the event of inclement weather the concert will be cancelled by 1 p.m. the day of the show. There will be a recorded message on the borough office line, 610-273-2020. Every effort will be made by the borough and the performers to reschedule cancelled concerts. \n  \nFor more information about Across the Pond, visit www.acrossthepondmusic.com.
0840_c6117c5c-29b9-46b5-9224-98f79a99b881	Dan Carter won't get to practice his kicking at the match venue before the game against Georgia. \n             \nAnalysis is a big part of the All Blacks success, but they haven't spent too many precious hours watching footage of their next Rugby World Cup pool opponents Georgia since they arrived in Cardiff. \n \nThat's partly because there isn't a mountain of evidence in the team's video vault, but it's also because the test is not as much about working out Georgia as it is continuing to build toward the quarterfinals. \n \nThe All Blacks would never say as much, coach Steve Hansen respectfully sticking to the line that the team must earn its place in the knockout stages, but the reality is that goal was effectively achieved when they beat Argentina. \n \n READ MORE \n \n  \n       \n \nThe challenge now is to keep adding blocks to their game plan and openside Sam Cane admitted focusing too closely on an opponent they had never played could be of minimal value. \n \n"If you haven't played a team it's tough to work out what they're going to do," Cane said on Tuesday. "We plan to do stuff our way but it doesn't always work out that way. A lot of the adjusting has to be done on the field." \n \nAgainst Namibia, there was a feeling the All Blacks' best laid training plans didn't quite pan out as the Africans ripped into the breakdown and rushed up in defence, forcing penalties and handling errors respectively. \n \nIt's not to say the All Blacks have not done any due diligence on Georgia, but the coaches have left it up to the players as to how much they want to find out before kick off. \n \n"It varies for the individual," Cane said. "Some guys will feel more comfortable knowing a lot more and others find if they do a bit much they feel they've got too much going on in their head and they're over thinking things. They might think the opposition are going to run a play because they've analysed it one way and then they haven't done it that way. \n \n"Personally I'll probably spend half an hour watching what the opposition does, mainly looking through any special strikes I need to know; if the seven, nine, ten, eight need to have a connection [on defence] then we'll talk about that." \n \nFirst five-eighth Dan Carter said the All Blacks strategy groups for defence and attack would look at the opposition then present to the squad, "to effectively get the game plan how we want to play." \n    \n"It's been a bit tougher finding as many clips as we would like on Georgia and last week's opponents as you would when you play Australia or South Africa, a team you play so often," he said. "[But] Our analysis guys have been working hard and there have already been a couple of games already to get a feel of how they like to play." \n \nThe secretive nature of team training sessions has become something of a feature of World Cups as teams keep their closely guarded team selections and tactics close to their chests. \n \nIn Cardiff this week the All Blacks have been training behind the same giant steel fence erected at their base in London before their first two matches. \n \nSo exactly what they're up to after the initial warmups and ball skills remains a mystery to all but the players, coaches and the team's security detail. \n \nBut it's likely the All Blacks care far less about what the Georgians plan to do, than what they want to achieve as a team. \n \nMeanwhile, Carter said the team's kickers would not be able to practise their kicking at the match venue the day before the test due to Wales and Fiji playing at Millennium Stadium the that day. \n  \n

0845_61f9fa3d-ff2d-4d3c-80c1-9bbd17264b05	(CNN) -  \nBobby Brown has spoken publicly about his daughter for the first time since her death almost two months ago. \n \nAppearing on the daytime talk show "The Real," the singer opened up about the loss of Bobbi Kristina, his daughter with his ex-wife, the late Whitney Houston. \n\n"We prayed and hoped for six months for something better to happen," Brown said. "But when God calls you, he calls you." \n\nThe 22-year-old died in July after being found face down in the bathtub at her home outside Atlanta in January. Her father said his fondest memory is of her smile. \n\n"I mean not just because we have the same smile, the same gap and everything, but her smile and just her graciousness with loving people," he said.

0846_a58d5bae-b27b-433a-9ea1-0cdc3920b5bb	Compass Business Solutions, a leading specialized learning partner for Cisco, has launched 19 new Borderless Learning Programs as part of its mentoring and blended learning approach. These programs offer live instruction, electronic learning, labs and mentoring for professionals in need of IT, Desktop Software, Security, Cloud, Project Management, Leadership and other training. \n\n"Employee retention has dropped from an average of 9 years to less than 3 years. Companies are struggling to address the causes. According to Gallup less than one-third of employees feel engaged at work. Add to that the growing frustration from lack of relevant training and we see the result of employees jumping from company to company," said Jules Trono, President and CEO of Compass Business Solutions. "Training programs need to do more than provide generic knowledge. They need to contribute to an employee's sense of value and contribution, making them want to stay and grow within a company. Our Borderless Learning Programs provide the live interaction and mentoring that is not always available within a company because employees today are expected to be self-motivated and self-sufficient." Compass has launched Borderless Learning Programs for both IT and non-IT employees, covering leadership and professional development as well as desktop software user and IT technical topics. \n\n"Whether an employee needs help with Excel or Outlook, or they need to get a Six Sigma certification, they want the flexibility to choose how and when they learn," said Donna Wyvill, VP of Operations and Content for Compass Business Solutions. "This is even more important when you take into account that as many as 40% of a company's employees could be contractors. They need training solutions that provide the flexibility to pick and choose topics without requiring travel or absence from the office for weeks at a time. The blended learning approach of the Borderless Learning Programs allow them to break-up training into manageable chunks with access to live mentors throughout their learning subscription. It is the best of all worlds. Compass is the largest learning provider focused on unified collaboration and telepresence training globally, and provides training for many other specializations such as Cisco, Microsoft, CompTIA, Mile 2, ITIL, Juniper, NetApp, Pexip, VMware and PMP. \n\nCompanies or students interested in learning more about Compass' training programs in the US and globally can visit https://compassprogram.com, and can contact Lisa Santiago at +1 (760) 688-4045 or +1 (877) 234-0635 for more information. \n\nAbout Compass Business Solutions Compass Business Solutions is a learning company that offers training to help people achieve and maintain training and certifications that are necessary to win and perform work, including Mile2, Cisco, Microsoft, ITIL, PMP and others. In addition to traditional 1-week training classes Compass offers the Borderless Learning Program for blended live virtual and electronic learning. This program removes the travel burden from students through live virtual delivery of instruction and on-demand lab access, and spreads out the time commitment so you are not out of the field for a week at a time. The program also provides mentoring so you can continue to get questions answered throughout the subscription term. This gives you an advantage in the ability to maintain current knowledge with extended hands-on access to lab equipment. \n\nCompass was founded in 2008 by communication industry professionals who have been working with telecommunication and video technologies since 1989 and who helped launch Tandberg University in the USA in 2006, then becoming Cisco's first authorized TelePresence Specialist Learning Partner in the US. \n\nCompass is a certified WBE/WOSB.
0847_b83ba57b-6b05-487b-a606-3a0c9884972f	Birmingham Women's Hospital, where the National Sperm Bank is based. Not an especially sexy building, is it? (Photo by Oosoom ) \n\nBritain has a sperm shortage. In fact, "shortage" doesn't do the situation justice – it's been announced this week that, a year after opening, the National Sperm Bank has had a grand total of only nine donors.  That's enough to help 90 families, but it's still a pretty miserable effort from our menfolk. So what can we do about i? \n\nWell, firstly Britain doesn't have a sperm shortage. Britain has lots of sperm. We produce billions upon billions of the little underachievers every day.  If anything, we have too much sperm. We have so much sperm that, if we grew it all to maturity, we'd have a trillion-strong army of Brits conquering not just this world but a large portion of the galaxy. \n\nWhat we have is a delivery problem. Instead of marching across northern France or waiting patiently in a sperm bank test tube for the cold pipette of destiny, Britain's sperm are stuck in balled up tissues, dissolving in laundry detergent, or being slaughtered by the million in the surprisingly hostile environment that is a woman's vagina. \n\nRead: Ban Sex Work? Fuck Off, White Feminism \n \n\nSo why is something so easy to make and so readily thrown away so hard to get hold of? Simple: donating sperm is ridiculously hard to do. \n\nYou probably have an idea about sperm donation from your favourite sitcom. Giving sperm is a scene we've seen on TV about a billion times, always played for laughs. Guy walks into a clinic. Guy shuffles awkwardly in front of the attractive woman at reception and is directed to a small room filled with dirty magazines. Nature takes its course, he comes out with a little pot of goo and a doctor tells him how many swimmers he's got. \n\nIt turns out it's nothing like that. Not even close. While it's certainly not as hard as donating eggs (a topic for a whole other post), donating sperm is so awkward and disruptive for such a limited chance of success that it's amazing the National Sperm Bank managed to get nine whole men to take part. \n\nLet's assume you're a healthy male between 18 and 41. You then have to attend a clinic to pass an initial assessment and test.  Since there are very few clinics around, and they tend to be in say, the centre of cities, you probably have an irritating and expensive commute to deal with. You fill in a questionnaire and provide a sample... oh, and did you remember to abstain from alcohol, sex or masturbation for the last 3 days? \n\nThe lab assesses your semen for sperm count, sperm motility and sperm shape, and carries out a test freeze to see if your wannabe babies are hardy enough to survive a stint on ice. Forty-eight hours later, you get the results back. Bang, 90 percent of you just failed. \n\nWatch our new film about the promising skateboarder who one day just vanished completely – Gone: The Story of Paul Alexander \n\t \n\nThe failures are the lucky ones.  Assuming you pass, the clinic will take more of your precious bodily fluids – blood and urine this time – to test for any infectious or genetic diseases. Get through that and after two commutes to a clinic, several hours of your time and a couple of train fares, you're rewarded with the princely sum of £35, and the opportunity to begin the donation process itslf. \n\nDonating isn't just a case of turning up and making a deposit – getting an actual woman pregnant would be easier. You now have to turn up to the clinic twice a week, every week for three to six months.  I live in Maidenhead, so for me that would work out at somewhere between £400 and £750 in train fares – to be paid for out of my £35 – and several hours per week of mytime. \n\nAnd before each of those visits, you need to abstain from any kind of sex or masturbation for three days. That leaves a narrow window of about 24 hours per week in which to conduct your entire sex life... for up to half a year. \n\nSo, that's what being a sperm donor means. Applying for a process you're 90 percent likely to be rejected from, so you can spend a large amount of your own time, energy and money, and cripple your own sex life for half a year, in the vague hope that at the end of it you might get someone you'll never meet pregnant. \n\nAll of these restrictions and demands can be easily justified. Clinics do need a lot of samples to be sure of getting a good batch. Abstaining from sex does help produce better quality sperm. Screening out diseases also makes sense if you can. \n\nThe problem is, while nine donors at the National Sperm Bank have met this gold standard, dozens – perhaps hundreds – of people they can't help are turning to the internet and social media to donate sperm privately. Sites with subtle names like "Donor Daddy" and "Tadpole Town" have sprung up, circumventing the professionals and satisfying demand directly.  Only last month, the Mail reported on a lesbian couple who approached a man advertising his services on Facebook. The man in question, Kenzie Kilpatrick, has apparently helped nine women to conceive. That's the equivalent of one birth for every donor in the National Sperm Bnk. \n \nBut these "services" are totally unregulated. There's no guarantee as to what you're getting or who you're dealing with, or what the quality of the sperm is likely to be. Of course it could be argued that the same is true for most non-donor pregnancies, but the potential for abuse is huge. The Mirror reported in 2013 on the case of a sperm donor professor who'd fathered 49 children, but was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault after complaints by a number of mothers. \n\nWhich raises a question – if the result of restrictions on sperm donation is just that people ignore them and go elsewhere, are they really doing anything for public health or safety? Would it be better to make the process easier and bring more people into contact with professionals, rather than continuing to run a system that most people simply bypass? I don't know, but people seem to be making up their own mind. \n\n@mjrobbins \n\n\nPreviously – Do School Bullies Really Grow Up to Be Sexier Than Nerds?

We have not allowed talks with the U.S. in other fields and we not negotiate with them," Khamenei said. \n\nSpeaking to a group of people in Tehran, Khamenei reiterated that America remains the "Great Satan." \n\n"The Iranian nation ousted the Satan. We should not let it back through the window to penetrate" Iran, he said. \n\nOn Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani signalled that Iran is ready to hold talks with the world powers on ways to resolve Syria's civil war, providing such negotiations can secure peace and democracy in the conflict-torn country. Iran supports embattled President Bashar Assad, whom the U.S. opposes. \n\nKhamenei also reiterated his hard stance against Israel. \n\n"I say that you (Israelis) will not see the coming 25 years and, God willing, there will not be something named the Zionist regime in next 25 years," he said. \n\nIran does not recognize Israel and supports militant anti-Israeli groups like the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Hezbollah groups. \n\nIsrael, which repeatedly criticized the nuclear deal, has not ruled out a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. \n \n©
0849_3e9884bf-f003-4399-b743-33e960fd6ec8	Andy Burnham has denied taking cash for access from a foreign donor, after The Sun reported that an undercover journalist gave £5,000 to a businessman who later arranged for him to meet the Labour leadership candidate.\n\nThe newspaper said that Faiz ul Rasool told the reporter, posing as a wealthy foreign donor, that Mr Burnham needed money to fund his bid to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader and offered a face-to-face meeting in return for a cash gift.\n\nTwo days later, on Monday this week, The Sun said that the businessman invited its reporter to a function near Labour's London HQ, where he was introduced to the Leigh MP and his British wife handed over a cheque for a further £3,000 to a campaign aide.\n\nBut a spokesman for Mr Burnham said that, while Mr Rasool had previously donated money to his campaign, he had no role in his team.\n\nA source in the Burnham camp said the leadership campaign had no knowledge of the £5,000 reportedly handed over in cash in a Mayfair casino.\n\nChecks on the £3,000 donation established that it was impermissible, as it came from a foreign national, so the cheque was not cashed, said the spokesman.\n\n"Faiz ul Rasool has had no role, formal or informal, within the Burnham campaign," said the spokesman.\n\n"He made a donation in July of £5,000, which was declared in accordance with standard compliance rules.\n\n"Mr Arshad was not invited to the reception held at campaign HQ on Monday evening and the event organisers were not notified that another guest was planning to bring him along. He asked for a photograph next to Andy, with people he claimed were his wife and baby.\n\n"During the event, (the donor) Mr Arshad - who was not introduced under that name - presented an unsolicited cheque to a campaign staffer in the names of Mr A Ali and Miss N K Khan.\n\n"Our routine due diligence threw up a number of discrepancies and as a result, the cheque was never cashed."\n\nThe spokesman said the Burnham campaign was writing to the Independent Press Standards Organisation about what he described as a "sting" involving hidden cameras and a baby.\n\nMr Rasool has made significant donations to Labour in the past, and is chair of Muslim Friends of Labour and Labour Friends of Pakistan.\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
0850_9a8d8368-135a-48c2-9ebb-68ff520049f5	Millions of Americans take baby aspirin every day to prevent a heart attack or stroke. If they are at high risk of heart disease, they're doing the right thing, according to draft recommendations issued Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. \n \nThe independent panel also said that taking low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years may also protect against colorectal cancer, at least in people who are already taking it to prevent heart attacks and stroke. \n \nAdults between the ages of 50 and 59 who have a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years benefit the most from taking about 81 milligrams of aspirin every day, the panel says. \n \nBut the potential benefit is smaller for adults between the ages of 60 and 69. And it's unknown for adults under 50 or over 70. People should talk with their health care provider to find out if they have health problems that would justify taking aspirin, according to Dr. Douglas Owens , a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force. \n \nFor example, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, obesity, age and diabetes can all increase heart disease risk. "Because heart attacks are caused by clots in the arteries of the heart, aspirin can help prevent heart attack and it can also help prevent strokes that are caused by blood clots," Owens says. \n \nSeveral groups including the American Heart Association offer online calculators to help people figure out their risk which, along with discussion with a health care provider, can help determine whether daily aspirin might be useful. \n \nHowever, there is a caveat. Daily aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and brain. And Owens says that people with medical conditions like ulcers, kidney problems, liver problems or bleeding disorders are more vulnerable, as are people who take blood thinning drugs and NSAIDs. \n \nThese new recommendations aren't final, and are open to public comment. \n \nConcerns have been raised about whether aspirin is really effective enough, when so many other medicines are available to help control heart disease risk. \n \nOne physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen , chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. "I think that millions of Americans are taking aspirin, some of them are really the 'worried well,' " he says. \n \nIf people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be "causing more harm than benefit." \n \nAnd while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk. \n \nNissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk. "With all the good therapies, better blood pressure control, better cholesterol control, all the things we do in modern medicine," he says, "over the last couple of decades, we've had nearly a 50 percent reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease." \n \nPeople who don't really need to should not be taking aspirin every day, says Nissen. "It's just not prudent or safe," he says, noting that bleeding in the abdomen or brain is extremely dangerous and can be fatal. Nissen does agree with the general consensus that taking low dose aspirin is beneficial for people who have had a heart attack or stroke. \n \nBut for pretty much everyone else, assessing actual heart disease risk in consultation with your doctor is crucial to deciding whether to take aspirin every day.

And they got enough another big day from running back Adrian Peterson.\n\nPeterson finished the game with 126 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries. It was the 30-year-old back's second straight game with at least 100 rushing yards.\n\nPeterson made the play of the game with a vintage touchdown run in the third quarter. He side-stepped a tackle in the backfield and stiff-armed another Chargers defender to the ground as he ran around the right end. He broke another tackle before reversing field for a 43-yard touchdown that put the Vikings up, 17-7.\n\nFullback Zach Line also scored in the third quarter, his second TD in as many weeks.\n\nThe Vikings sealed the victory, if it hadn't been sealed already, early in the fourth quarter when outside linebacker Chad Greenway intercepted a deflected pass and followed a convoy of blockers down the sideline for a 91-yard touchdown return.\n\nThe Vikings got on the board first with a 24-yard field goal from kicker Blair Walsh after outside linebacker Anthony Barr forced Rivers to fumble deep in Chargers territory. They increased their lead to 10-0 in the second quarter when Peterson capped off a long Vikings scoring drive with his first touchdown run in 22 months.\n\nThe Chargers scored late in the second quarter after Rivers found wide receiver Malcom Floyd for a 39-yard gain on 3rd and 18. Four plays later, Rivers connected with Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen, who caught the pass between cornerback Xavier Rhodes and safety Andrew Sendejo, and ran it in for a 34-yard touchdown.\n\nSendejo collided with Rhodes on the play. Rhodes, whose head got snapped backward by the safety, lay face down on the turf for a couple of minutes before being helped to the locker room. Rhodes was examined for a concussion at halftime and did not return. Trae Waynes, the team's first-round draft pick, replaced Rhodes in the second half.\n\nThe Vikings, now 2-1, travel to Denver next week to play Peyton Manning and the Broncos.

0854_f8800514-1588-49f6-8e71-7f4dfd135aa6	It might have been just another day out and about in London. \n\nBut Myleene Klass never lets an opportunity to make the street her catwalk, and on Friday she did it again. \n\nThe 37-year-old radio presenter looked like a late summer-early autumn delight in a pretty floral red dress, teamed with weather-appropriate and stylish extras. \n\n   \n   \nAutumn vibes: Myleene Klass looked gorgeous as she stepped out in a red floral dress in London on Friday \n\nShe covered her enviably slender frame with a covetable long-sleeved dark red dress, cut close to her figure a thte top before flowing out into a mid-length A-line skirt. \n \nAdding some colour to the ruby frock was a modern floral print in shades of poppy red, yellow and white, also hinting at an autumnal vibe. \n\nThe stunning star showed off her slim and shapely pins, decided it's not quite the time for tights, but made the overall look far more casual with some low-heeled, chunky grey boots, the socks pocking out the tops. \n   \nMixing it up: The 37-year-old swapped heels for a more casual, flat boot, but still managed to display her enviable legs \n   \nPretty: The dress included a yellow, red and white floral design, injecting a youthful vibe into the garment \n  \nGreat from all angles: The stunner showed off her fantastic physique as she strutted in her comfortable boots \n\nRounding it all off nicely, Myleene later donned a classic black leather jacket and a black suede fringed bag. \n\nHer mid-length brunette locks were poker straight, making her look as polished as ever, and she covered her features with a large pair of sunglasses for her trek through north London.  \n\nMeanwhile, during a recent interview with The Daily Telegraph, Myleene talked about her thriving career, admitting it is down to her ability to embrace a wide range of projects rather than her body. \n   \nGet warm! Later she covered up with a classic black leather jacket \n   \nNever-ending wardrobe: Friday's stylish display was one in a seemingly endless line for the fashionable star \n\nShe also touched on her rise to fame - and perhaps one of her most iconic moments, being seen wearing a white bikini during I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2006. \n\n'Many people mocked me for being jack of all trades', she said. 'But that's what saved me. If I was just a white bikini I'd be gone.' \n\nAnd despite her level of celebrity status, her daughters - with ex-husband Graham Quinn - don't know about her fame. \n\n'I won't allow the word 'diet' in my house', she told the newspaper in her revealing interview. 'It's got no positive connotations whatsoever. \n\n'Everything's down to have you lost weight and if you have, success must equal skinniness or skinniness must equal success, and I want them to know that cerebral mass equals success. Hard work equals success; talent.'  \n   \nGood spirits! As she went to continue her day, Myleene flung her brunette locks around and flashed a huge grin \n\n 
0855_46e8ac20-c860-4482-af76-e577d64b771b	BRA queen Michelle Mone started her new role as the Government’s business tsar this week – but admits she’s feeling the pressure.     \n NC  \n SPARKLING: Michelle’s new Diamonique jewellery collection is available from QV  \nPrime Minister David Cameron has appointed the millionaire lingerie tycoon as his new business adviser. \n\nAnd she is tasked with producing a report aimed at encouraging start-ups in deprived areas with high unemployment. \n\nMichelle will make her recommendations in 10 months’ time. \n\nAnd she started the ball rolling yesterday in Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan. Michelle, 43, left school at 15 without any qualifications and built up global lingerie empire Ultimo from scratch. \n\n“I’m really looking forward to understanding what the challenges are,” she says. \n\n“I have a certain amount of knowledge because of what I did but I want to hear what the challenges are from other people. \n\n“I want to hear about the barriers they are facing and what changes are needed. “I have a team of people from the Government helping me but I’m leading the report. \n\n“It’s quite nerve-wracking as well because it’s had such huge publicity since it launched. It’s even got to Ameica and Australia. \n\n NC  \n BUSINESS GURU: Michelle is using her business acumen to help people from deprived areas kic...  \n“I think all eyes are on me and on this report. I was going to try hard anyway, but I think I’ll be trying even harder now.” \n\nMichelle sold an 80% stake in Ultimo to a Sri Lankan firm last year and resigned from the board earlier this month. \n\nShe has built up a parallel career as a motivational speaker, but plans to commit significant time to her new entrepreneurship role: “I’m giving up a couple of days a week of my time on a voluntary basis for 10 months to get this repor done. \n \n“I’ll be going into the banks to see how they are helping, I’ll be going to accountants, to deprived areas across the UK. I’ll be doing as much as I possibly can.” \n\nGlasgow-born Michelle had another big occasion to mark this week – registering her new baroness title after being made a Tory peer. \n\nShe won’t be drawn too much on the subject, but says it was a “fascinating experience”. \n\nShe says: “I’ve just been blown away by the peerage and I’m really honoured. I can’t wait for it all to get going.” \n\nIf that’s not enough for the glamorous businesswoman, she also launches her new Diamonique range of jewellery on QVC today, with items priced between £29 and £100. \n\nProud Michelle says: “It’s taken me about a year to design the collection. \n\n“It looks incredible and it’s brilliant value for money. \n\n“The items will make you feel really confident and glamorous without spending hundreds of thousands of pounds – that’s like the cost of a house, after all! \n\n“I had 20 fashion editors over to my house for dinner and we did the Pepsi Challenge to see which was the ‘real’ ring and they couldn’t tell.” \n\nIn her autobiography earlier this year, Michelle spoke honestly about her struggles, including her bitter split fom her husband and her battles with her weight. \n\n NC  \n LADY IN BLUE: Michelle Mone wants to give deprived people a second chance at success  \nAnd she admits she still has to constantly work at being healthy. \n\nMichelle says: “I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been in. But I have to work out and I really watch what I eat. \n\n“If you want to maintain your weight and you want to feel amazing, you can’t sit and eat a tub of Haagen-Dazs watching TV. \n\n“If you do, your bum will be the size of a bus. \n\n“I think the problem is with fast food. We all live incredibly busy lives and it’s convenient food, isn’t it? \n\n“People think eating healthily is not a quick thing but it is – it takes you 15 minutes to cook a piece of salmon in the oven.” \n\nThe blonde, who is currently single, also gave up booze for three months after realising she was drinking too much. \n\n“I was getting into a bit of problem with it, just after the divorce,” she says. Control “It just got to be a big habit for me and I’m just so pleased I got it under control. \n\n“I still have fun but I don’t drink a bottle and a half of wine every night, and I don’t drink on my own. \n\n“I think if you spot the problem before anyone else does, that’s the secret. \n\n“And when I stopped for a few months, the weight fell off me as well.” \n\nShe smiles: “Now I feel great and the best I ever have.” \n\n*  Michelle Mone’s Diamonique Jewellery Collection is exclusive to QVC and has just launched. \n\nIt is available to buy from qvcuk.com as part of September Jewellery Month.
0856_e41391d5-ce1b-4bf6-bf26-3fbdd2625db0	BBC television boss Danny Cohen has been accused of breaking the broadcaster's own rules, after he secretly organised a lobbying letter signed by its stars. \n\nConservative MP Jesse Norman, who chairs the powerful Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said today that the controversial 'luvvies' letter' was a 'direct attempt' to influence the government, and called for a BBC inquiry into the television executive's behaviour. \n\nA string of actors, presenters and writers including Sir David Attenborough and JK Rowling signed the open letter to Prime Minister David Cameron in July, telling him that the Government's plans to reform the BBC would damage Britain. \n  \nAccusations: BBC television boss Danny Cohen (left) has been accused of breaking the broadcaster's own rules, after he secretly organised a lobbying letter to Prime Minister David Cameron (right) signed by its stars \n\nHowever, the lobbying attempt backfired after it emerged that Mr Cohen had put them up to it, and that one of the 29 signatories – DJ Annie Nightingale – had not even read the letter before it was sent out. \n\nIn an uncomfortable Select Committee hearing today, Mr Norman repeatedly asked BBC director general Lord Tony Hall whether Mr Cohen had broken the rules. \n\nLord Hall battled to defend the £327,800-a-year television executive, arguing that he is allowed to speak up for the BBC and the broadcasting sector.  \n \nHe also claimed that the BBC was inundated by offers of help from well-known figures, who wanted to express their support for the Corporation. \n\nBut Mr Norman refused to let him off the hook. \n\n'I put it to you that the Corporation's editorial policy says that the BBC must be independent and – I quote – 'distanced from government initiatives, campaigns, charities and their agenda,' he said. \n\nHe added: 'This was a direct attempt by proxy to influence a government initiative.' \n   \nCall for action: Conservative MP Jesse Norman, who chairs the powerful Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee,  on Tuesday called for a BBC inquiry into the television executive's behaviour (file picture) \n  \nFamous faces: A string of actors, presenters and writers including Sir David Attenborough (right) and JK Rowling (left) signed the open letter, saying he Government's plans to reform the BBC would damage Britain \n\nMeanwhile, Mr Norman also lambasted Lord Hall over the way the letter was put together, and presented to the public as something the stars had done of their own accord. \n\n'It wasn't that [Miss Nightingale] offered it. She didn't know about the letter. Someone called her up and said will you sign the letter,' Mr Norman said. \n\nWhen Lord Hall responded that he did not 'know the detail' of how the letter was put together, the clearly exasperated MP said: 'Well, why haven't you held an inquiry into it?' \n\nThe BBC initially denied having 'anything' to do with the letter when it was published in July, and then issued a carefully worded statement insisting it was 'from the signatories [and] speaks for itself'. \n   \nBackfire: The lobbying attempt backfired after it emerged that Mr Cohen had put them up to it, and that one of the 29 signatories – DJ Annie Nightingale (seen in July) – had not even read the letter before it was sent out \n\nIt only admitted that the BBC was 'involved' around 36 hours after the letter was published, after Miss Nightingale and veteran presenter Michael Palin had both pointed the finger. \n\nBut today, BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead appeared to be oblivious of this sequence of events, as she insisted that the BBC had 'made it clear' that it was involved in the controversial letter. \n\n'I think it is reasonable for any organisation to encourage its supporters to speak out on its behalf and I also think the BBC made it clear that they were involved, so none of the public will have been under any illusion that there had been some BBC participation,' she said. \n\nMiss Fairhead, who also sits on the boards of HSBC and Pepsi, insisted that the controversial letter was a matter for the BBC executive to deal with. \n\nHowever, Mr Norman did not appear quite as easily satisfied. \n\nHe told Lord Hall that his answers were not 'adequate' and asked for a fuller response in writing. \n\nIt has been rumoured that Mr Cohen's wife, the glamourous Professor Noreena Hertz, was actually the brains behind the letter. \n\nMiss Hertz, who is six years his senior, put her name to a similar round robin in 2010, which tried to position the Liberal Democrats as 'change makers'. \n\nShe also counts two of the signatories of the BBC letter – Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig – as close friends.  \n\nThe Hollywood couple attended Mr Cohen's wedding to Miss Hertz in 2012, where Miss Weisz was a bridesmaid. \n\n

0858_5312b8a1-1081-45a5-b1a5-cfc5c57150b5	Review by Elisa DARKNESS BRUTAL\nby Rachel A. Marks Series: The Dark Cycle (Book 1)\nPaperback: 422 pages\nPublisher: Skyscape (July 1, 2015)\nLanguage: EnglishGoodreads | Amazon \nAidan O’Linn’s childhood ended the night he saw a demon kill his mother and mark his sister, Ava, with Darkness. Since then, every three years the demons have returned to try to claim her. Living in the gritty, forgotten corners of Los Angeles, Aidan has managed to protect his sister, but he knows that even his powers to fight demons and speak dead languages won’t keep her safe for much longer.\nIn desperation, Aidan seeks out the help of Sid, the enigmatic leader of a group of teens who run LA Paranormal, an Internet reality show that fights demons and ghosts. In their company, Aidan believes he’s finally found a haven for Ava. But when he meets Kara, a broken girl who can spin a hypnotic web of passionate energy, he awakens powers he didn’t know he had―and unleashes a new era of war between the forces of Light and the forces of Darkness.\nWith the fate of humanity in his hands, can Aidan keep the Darkness at bay and accept his brilliant, terrifying destiny? Darkness Brutal totally caught me by surprise. I had been reading books found in Kindle Unlimited--you can borrow one a month if you are a Prime member--and was sorely disappointed that all the books I want to read weren't available to borrow. But Darkness Brutal popped-up as a recommendation for me based-off of my ratings. Having just come out, there were few reviews to guide me. And I don't usually read Indie books (although here is another I recently read, Gift of Poison). Even so, I thought I would give it a chance.   I shouldn’t have been concerned. Darkness Brutal was great. Really great. Definitely in my top ten YA this year! I knew Andye was going to post an Indie Spotlight on Darkness Brutal, but I swore I would write a review too, even if later, because it was just that good and I wanted to make sure all of you know it! Darkness Brutal was like any classic Demon hunter book, very Cassandra Clare’s Mortal Instruments and it was just as engaging as any of her series. The story starts rolling with action right away, a homeless teen dispatching a demon and discovering that he had a few more skills up his sleeves than he knew of. We like the guy too, as imperfect as Aiden is. He is trying to keep his sister alive while dealing with crazy flashbacks of his past, like gory demon-led murderer and all the confusion in the world surrounding his witchy mother and father, vacated. Right away Aiden is introduced to a new crew. They are paranormal, but not in vampire and werewolf style, but more like superhero sensing. It made me think of a combo-pack of The Hourglass, Paranormalcy with a tad bit of Miss. Perigrine’s. I loved that together these kids hosted a TV show on paranormal activity, which seemed like a good income if you are so-gifted. There were some great characters in this book. The other people on the team just brought in the humor and pulled out the depths of the main characters. But, Sid. I really didn’t like Sid, the creepy guy who lead the kids. He seemed to dabble in pretty nasty stuff and we all knew he was hiding something. Then there was Kara, the tension was always so high with her and we knew she was hiding secrets under her tats with her disturbing gift and disturbing task. I wasn’t sure if I should dislike her, love her, or just feel pity, despite her tough exterior. But by the end of the book I ended up loving Kara. I originally was rooting for the other girl so in need of saving. I can’t always handle love triangles, and author Rachel Marks weaved this one in a way I’m still not sure I can tolerate, with too many hanging threads, despite how close one of these couples became. This novel was anything but boring. Through the whole story there was action, whether it was with people, love, family, or demons. I didn’t feel like it was shallow either, it ran deep in a way where it really was evil vs. good, rather than just on the surface and it provoked. Then there was the mystery; it took a few turns I was in no way expecting.  It wasn’t easy to piece everything together--I just read this a couple months ago and already want to re-read it, just to figure it out more and remind myself it wasn’t just in my imagination that I loved Darkness Brutal so much. I am so excited this is a series and can’t wait for the next one! Of course, after I was so impressed with this novel, I looked up the author, Rachel A. Marks, and discovered she is also a talented book-cover design artist and just all around looks like a cool person. I was bummed I didn’t go to the San Diego Comic-Con the week before to meet her. But at least I have Marks’ book and I am convinced you should too (something I rarely ever say), if you like paranormal even just a little bit.  I am afraid of saying more, lest I spoil anything. I want you to love it!

0859_70bebfae-c258-4e9b-8271-90e373cc317e	Latest news and developments from the US presidential election             \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The White House   Photo: Alamy      \n\t\t        \n • US presidential campaign has begun in earnest \n• Debates underway as Donald Trump leads polls \n• What you need to know about the election \n• Which Republicans are running?  \n\nAll the latest from the 2016 US presidential election: \nSeptember 8 \nAn admiring letter from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, sent in 1987, was uncovered on Tuesday. \n\nDonald Trump's US vs Them rhetoric on the campaign trail has led to comparisons with America's now-infamous 37th president. \n\nIt turns out that Mr Nixon, or at the very least his wife Pat, may have seen a bit of himself in the then 41-year-old real estate developer. \n \nNixon sent an admiring letter to Donald Trump in 1981, encouraging him to run for office http://t.co/iTtW1NeMxT  pic.twitter.com/hFzHWoUUPR \n— The New York Times (@nytimes) September 8, 2015  \nIn the letter, which is included in an upcoming biography of Mr Trump seen by the New York Times , the former president tells Mr Trump that his wife watched his appearance on Donahue, a talk show, and came away impressed. \n\n"As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!" Mr Nixon wrote. \n\nMr Nixon left office in 1974 and penned the letter 13 years later. \n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mrs Nixon's prediction will prove accurate. \nSeptember 7 \n Joe Biden spoke at a Labor Day rally in Pittsburgh on Monday, and while attendees embraced his enthusiastic message on organised labour and rebuilding the middle class, there was something else on their minds. \n\nChants of "Run Joe Run!" echoed through the crowd, and listening to his populist oration it would have been easy to mistake the US vice president for a presidential candidate. \n\nThis was a different Joe Biden than the man who said just weeks ago that he might not have the "emotional energy" to run. \n \nIn support of unions, Biden tells labor to "organize, organize, organize." Says labor builds America. pic.twitter.com/VmrK2VGhT6 \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) September 7, 2015  \nPerhaps sensing a cue, a man yelled out during the speech, "Run for president!" \n\nMr Biden's response? \n\n"You've got to talk to my wife about that." He then paused momentarily before adding, "I've got to talk to my wife about that." \n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mr Biden will join the race, but he'll have a prime venue later this week should he choose to make an announcement. On Thursday night he will be one of the first ever guests on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \nSeptember 6 \n Sarah Palin said Sunday that she would like to serve as Donald Trump's energy secretary if he becomes president, but that it would be a "short-term job". \n\nWhile the 2008 vice presidential candidate and Tea Party darling says "energy is my baby" she, like many Republicans, opposes the regulations imposed by the department of energy, and would like it eliminated. \n\nShe also defended Mr Trump's assertion that Jeb Bush should speak only English while campaigning in America. \n\nShe said while it is positive thing that Mr Bush is able to speak Spanish (noting that she took Spanish in school), he should send the message that, "when you're here, let's speak American". \n\n [embedded content] \n\nShe clarified that she meant English, adding that "a unifying aspect of a nation is the language that is understood by all". \n\nMr Trump has called Mrs Palin a "special person", and said In July that he would love to have her serve in his cabinet. \n\nIn Sunday's interview Mrs Palin also took aim at President Barack Obama for not confronting Russia and China for their military aggression during his trip to her home state of Alaska. \n\n"How about, while he was up here, he had carried a big stick, instead of a selfie stick?" she said, referring to a video released by the White House in which Mr Obama does, in fact, use a selfie stick. \n\nChinese military ships were spotted in the Bering Straight last week, while in July Russian aircraft were intercepted near Alaska. \nSeptember 6 \nIn Iowa, no Republican who has ever held political office has more than six per cent in an NBC/Marist poll released Sunday . Donald Trump and Ben Carson , a real estate developer and a retired neurosurgeon respectively, are miles ahead of the field. \n\n [embedded content] \n\nMeanwhile among Democrats in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton trails Senator Bernie Sanders , an unapologetic soclialist, by an 11 point margin. \n\nIn a race to become the world's most powerful political figure, the very word "politician" is hurled about like an insult. Voters appear to never have cared less who "looks presidential". \n\nIt remains whether to be seen whether the summer of America's discontent- with the so-called establishment, and with politics in general- will spill into the winter, when the first official ballots will be cast. \n\nIf so, the popular logic that Mrs Clinton is inevitable, and that Republicans will, as is their custom, fall in line behind a "sensible" candidate like Jeb Bush or Senator Marco Rubio may be flipped on its head. \nSeptember 4 \nDonald Trump had a series of foreign policy fumbles during an interview Thursday with popular conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \n\nTake this exchange for example- \n\n Hewitt : "Are you familiar with General Suleimani?" \n\n Trump : "Yeesss... Go ahead give me a little, go ahead tell me." \n\n Hewitt : "He runs the Quds forces" \n\n Trump : "Yes, OK. I think the Kurds by the way have been horribly treated by us". \n\n Hewitt : "No not the Kurds the Quds forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds forces, the bad guys." \n\n [embedded content] \n\nAfter a rocky few minutes in which Trump accused Hewitt of asking "gotcha questions", Hewitt asked if the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah mattered to him at this point in the campaign. \n\n"It will when it's appropriate," Trump responded. "I will know more about it than you know, and believe me it won't take long." \n\n"I will know far more than you know within 24 hours after I get the job." \nSeptember 2 \nWhen the Republican National Committee asked each of the party's 17 presidential candidates Wednesday to take a "loyalty oath" pledging to support whichever candidate ultimately won the party's nomination, it appeared they were attempting to put pressure on Donald Trump . \n\nMr Trump has publicly flirted with running as an Independent, a prospect which would all but hand the presidency to the Democratic nominee (probably Hillary Clinton ). \n\nDuring the party's first debate last month he memorably refused to pledge his support to the eventual Republican nominee. \n\n [embedded content] \n\nBut the billionaire real estate mogul may have changed his mind. He is holding an event tomorrow afternoon with RNC chairman Reince Priebus , according to the New York Times, where it seems likely that he will sign the oath. \n\nThis comes after Jeb Bush accused Mr Trump of being a Republican only when convenient (and Mr Trump, incidentally, said Mr Bush should stop speaking Spanish in America). \n\nThe Bush campaign was unwilling to give him much credit for his newfound loyalty. \n \n. @ZekeJMiller  @realDonaldTrump  @JebBush Generally, Republican candidates for President decide they are Republicans before they run for POTUS \n— Tim Miller (@Timodc) September 2, 2015  September 1 \n Jeb Bush has been attacked by the Republican base for not being a "true conservative". And yet the man currently leading the polls is a former Democrat who has in the past described himself as "very liberal on healthcare", "very pro-choice" and staked out positions way out of step with the Republican platform. \n\nMr Bush has released a new campaign advertisement in which he seeks to shed light on "the real Donald Trump ": \n\n [embedded content] \n\nMr Trump was unimpressed. \n \nYet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2015  August 23 \nShould the children of illegal immigrants born in the US be granted birthright citizenship? The Constitution seems to say yes, but Donald Trump says no, and has so very, very loudly in recent days. \n \nNow that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally speaking up. Just politicians! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2015  \nThe Republican base has been fixated with so-called "anchor babies" for years, arguing that undocumented families use American-born children to "gain a foothold" in the US. \n\nMr Trump has tapped into that sentiment, using the case of a pregnant mother crossing the border in order to have a child, and arguing that that child is not really an American. That rhetoric has fired up his supporters, but party strategists worry it will alienate not only Hispanics, but independents who polls show are much more moderate on immigration. \n\nJeb Bush provided a counterpoint, arguing that the way to fix the US immigration system was not to "take away rights that are Constitutionally endowed". \n \nHis massive inconsistencies aside, @realDonaldTrump ’s immigration plan is not conservative and does not reflect our nation's values. \n— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) August 21, 2015  \nScott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, was somewhere in the middle- or more precisely, on one side and then the other. He said last week that he wanted to end birthright citizenship, then said Sunday that he did not. \n\n Wisconsin governor and Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker   Photo: Bloomberg  \nAugust 22 \nVice-president Joe Biden raised eyebrows Saturday by meeting with Elizabeth Warren , the Massachusetts senator and progressive icon. \n\nMrs Warren, a banker bashing former Harvard professor, has a massive grassroots following and would perhaps have been Hillary Clinton's most fearsome challenger had she elected to run. Mr Biden appears to be cosying up to her as he decides whether to launch a presidential bid of his own. \n\n Barack Obama and Joe Biden run in the White House   Photo: YouTube/letsmove \n\nMr Biden is beloved by Democrats for his warmth, passion and fierce loyalty to president Barack Obama .

And she described how the Islamic world was once "the greatest civilization" on the planet and a centre of art, science and commerce. \n\n Although we are often unaware of our indebtedness to this other civilization, its gifts are very much a part of our heritage. The technology industry would not exist without the contributions of Arab mathematicians. Sufi poet-philosophers like Rumi challenged our notions of self and truth. Leaders like Suleiman contributed to our notions of tolerance and civic leadership.  \n\n Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina   Photo:  \n\nThose words are coming back to haunt her now that she is running to be the Republican president candidate in next year's election. \n\nA transcript of her speech was dug up and highlighted by Bethany Blankley, a conservative blogger, who said her gentle words about Islam "could not be more offensive". \n\n Perhaps she should move to Saudi Arabia where women are prohibited from driving; or Iran, where women are prohibited from working. Her speech 14 years ago only reveals that Carly has been flying on a mystical magical carpet to nowhere for years.  \n\nBlankley's post was pushed out on social media by Michele Bachmann, a former Republican congresswoman and a failed presidential candidate in 2012. \n \nCarly Fiorina delivered this speech in MPLS praising Muslims 2 weeks after 911. http://t.co/t74JLWrHye \n— Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) August 17, 2015  August 18 \nIn a videotaped conversation with BlackLivesMatter activists on Monday, Hillary Clinton acknowledged the need for a "reckoning" over past and current societal prejudice against Black people, but pushed the activists to produce concrete policy proposals that she could integrate into her platform. \n\n"In politics, if you can't explain it and you can't sell it it stays on the shelf," she said, constrasting BlackLivesMatter with the civil rights, women's rights, and gay rights movements. \n\n"You're going to have to come together as a movement and say, 'Here's what we want done about it'." \n\n [embedded content]  \n\nAugust 16 \nAfter Donald Trump arrived at the Iowa state fair in a helicopter with his name emblazoned on the side, his opponents were quick portray him as out of touch with the ordinary voter. \n\n"We left the helicopter at home," deadpanned Bernie Sanders.

0860_58893b22-6c73-42e0-b392-9d4ec81619a9	Jennifer Lawrence on fame, Amy Schumer and THAT photo with Kris Jenner. \n\n"I picture myself drowning." \n\nJennifer Lawrence swallows hard and continues: "I picture myself drowning. Outwardly, I look like I'm having a blast, and I am, at least on some levels. There I was — burp, burp, burp — just a little gal from Kentucky getting discovered by big ol' Hollywood. But inside I'm terrified. In an instant — boom — everyone's listening, everyone's looking."\n\nLawrence, 25, was trying to remember the even younger woman she was in 2011 as the promotional campaign for the first Hunger Games movie began.\n\nThe attention was not entirely new; she attended the 2011 Academy Awards as a best actress nominee, for the gritty indie film Winter's Bone. But that experience was nothing compared with the scrutiny that arrived when she signed on to play Katniss Everdeen, the reluctant fighter at the centre of the Hunger Games series.\n\nAnd now? How does Lawrence assess herself as she prepares to say goodbye to Katniss?\n\nThe answer emerged during an hourlong conversation last month. She arrived for the afternoon interview fully primped for a photo shoot (black stilettos, white micro-miniskirt with zippers on the side) and took command: efficient handshake, can we please turn off the air conditioning, let's get on with this.\n\nBefore long, though, she had her feet on the sofa and was unwrapping candy while laughing and showing signs of being a fun gossip. Here are excerpts:\n\nQ. At this point, Katniss has been through the mill. She's had to hunt children for sport against her will. She's been bedeviled more than once by that godforsaken cat.\n\nA. If Katniss was scared in the last movie, then she is almost numb in the next one. She's been through so much.\n\nDoes the same description apply to you? You've been through a lot, too, over these last few years. Your private photos stolen and published online. Your pay for American Hustle dumped on the Internet as part of the Sony hack. Falling down at the Oscars.\n\nCould you maybe rattle off a few more mortifying things about me? [Laughs.]\n\nSorry. How have you personally changed since the first Hunger Games?\n\nI don't feel like I'm being dragged by anything any more. I feel more in control. I'm calmer. I know that there's no point to feeling anxious all day, so I try not to. I'm still scared, but it's about different things. Now, I worry about — [Trails off and shifts a bit uncomfortably on the sofa.] OK, get ahold of yourself, Jennifer. This is not therapy.\n\nOh, but it is. Just a different kind.\n\nYou want to know how I've changed? I'm so scared to say anything now. I can see every negative way that people can take it, and I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. "Oh, she's so conceited now. Oh, she's so jaded now." It probably comes from Googling myself. If it were up to me, I would not talk. I would just act.\n\nYou Google yourself? You must promise to never, ever do that again.\n\nYou try being 22, having a period and staying away from Google. I once Googled "Jennifer Lawrence Ugly." [Laughs] Do I sound bitchy?\n\nNot at all. You sound like a real person.\n\nI can't think of a more wasteful use of my time than to worry about this. Why do I care what people think? But I do. I just can't pretend I don't care. I get really insecure about it. The world makes an opinion of you without ever meeting you. That worry should not bother me, but it does. It bothers me. [Takes a sip of water.]\n\nI'm going to leave here and think, Oh God, why couldn't I just have been cool and confident?\n\nHow do you deal with that anxiety?\n\nI have a prescription. [Laughs.]\n\nThat makes two of us!\n\nI find a certain peace by thinking of me in public as sort of an avatar self. You out there can have the avatar me. I can keep me. And I just try to acknowledge that this scrutiny is stressful, and that anyone would find it stressful. So I've got to try to let it go, and try to be myself, and focus on important things, like picking up dog poop.\n\nPicking up what?\n\nI have a little mutt, and we just moved into a new house. She thinks that the hallway with the guest bedrooms is a lost land where I never go and that she can use as her own personal bathroom.\n\nHow did you and Amy Schumer become friends?\n\nI emailed her after I saw Trainwreck and said: "I don't know where to get started. I guess I should just say it: I'm in love with you." We started emailing, and then emailing turned to texting. There's actually something about us that I'm dying to make public, but I'm not sure if I can. Let me text my publicist and ask if it's OK. [Types on her iPhone]\n\nShe says I can tell you: Amy and I are writing a movie together! We play sisters, and we're almost done writing. It just flowed out of us. We've got about 100 pages right now.\n\nWow. Any more details?\n\nAmy and I were creatively made for each other. We have different flavours. It's been the most fun experience of my life. We start the day off on the phone, laughing. And then we send each other pages. And we crack up. I'm flying out tomorrow to see her in Chicago.\n\nLet me just text Amy and tell her that I told you. [Types. Receives an instant response.] I wrote, 'I just spilled the beans to The New York Times. Is that O.K.?' And Amy wrote back: 'That you're gay? Totally! It's exciting!' [Laughs]\n\nA couple years ago, you said in an interview — see, your words coming back to haunt you — that you feel less overwhelmed by fame if you stay home, so you were just staying inside your house a lot. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore.\n\nI realised at some point that I can live this life in my own way, that there are ways of joining Hollywood without being someone other than myself. For example, I don't have to go to the Chateau Marmont to have a birthday party. I can just have it at my house.\n\nSpeaking of which, you just had a birthday. What was Kris Jenner doing there? The Internet lost its mind when someone posted that photo of the two of you.\n\nI would love to talk about this. My two best friends planned a surprise birthday with a big surprise within the surprise. So I'm there, and people start singing Happy Birthday. Kris Jenner comes out holding my cake. It was the closest I've ever come to losing consciousness. I had no idea! I'd never met her before, but we've always watched Keeping Up With the Kardashians. And then Kris Jenner and I sang Build Me Up Buttercup on karaoke and took that picture.\n\nThat sounds like an awfully fun time.\n\nI have an amazing life. I love my life. I love my friends.\n\nHas anything about being a superstar gotten easier with time?\n\nI believe in myself more, and that makes things easier. Early on, you wear clothes you don't want to wear or say the sound bite you didn't want to say because you're afraid to speak up or be rude. And then you start to feel like a puppet. Now I just speak up. "No, I know what my hair looks like when you do that, and I don't like it. No, we're not gonna just try it. I've already tried it." But things are tougher, too.\n\nLike?\n\nI can get movies fully greenlit, and hundreds of people are devoting years of their lives to something that may not be happening otherwise. Does that mean it's good? I can't be the only one with an opinion around here.\n\nI'm really afraid that I sound like I'm complaining, which I'm totally not. I'm just explaining.\n\nHow do you choose your films? After the next Hunger Games comes Joy, with David O. Russell directing you again, and then an outer space movie.\n\nYou know, I read scripts. I hire people for their opinions, and I listen. But ultimately the gamble is a part of your art. I do things that I respond to, and try not to overthink it.\n\nNot overthink it in the same way that you don't like to work scenes to death on your own before coming to the set?\n\nI'm happy that you have taken that to an intellectual level and made it complimentary, but it's really just pure laziness. I memorise my lines in hair and makeup.\n\nYou have two kids in the movie, right? Do you feel old enough for that?\n\nDavid gets visions. He's in his own beautiful, amazing world. Those kinds of silly questions don't really matter to him. It's not like I was old enough for American Hustle. And I was way too young for Silver Linings [Playbook]. That's why I almost didn't get it.\n\nWhat are you going to miss most about your Hunger Games experience? Your cast mates? I know you're particularly close to Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth.\n\nOn the last day it was so emotional, and we kind of couldn't let go of each other. We were kind of freaked out that something was ending. And then, a week later, we were hanging out at Liam's house. We were like, "Oh, OK, so now we can just be friends."\n\nAfter seeing that nothing really changed with the three of us — four, including Woody [Harrelson], but he lives in Hawaii, so it's trickier — we were fine. I mean, this was yesterday: Woody texted me, and said he had a dream about me. And I was like, "Was I amazing?" And then Josh called me and told me he had a dream about Woody. And then my friend came over to my house and told me she had a sex dream about Liam.\n\nI didn't dream about anyone, but there's always tonight.\n\nThe New York Times The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0861_479cbf8c-95ce-4cab-850a-1f060bcfbd02	Merchandise exports plunged 20.7 per cent to $21.3 billion in August from $26.8 billion in the year-ago period, the ninth consecutive monthly decline and the steepest in the first five months of this financial year. The fall resulted from a massive demand slowdown in global markets and an uncertain global economic environment, owing to a crisis in China. \nThe value of exports in August was the lowest in about five years. \n\n  \nIndia wasn’t the only Asian country to see a steep fall in exports. A YES Bank note said exports from Korea declined 14.7 per cent in August, the most in six years, while those from China contracted 5.5 per cent. \nFor April-August, exports from India stood at $111.1 billion, down 16.2 per cent compared with $132.5 billion in the year-ago period, according to data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Tuesday. \n\n“Average growth in export volumes remains subdued … In a nutshell, both the value and volume impact should continue to weigh on the exports trajectory in FY16,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist, YES Bank. \n\nIn August, imports shrunk 9.9 per cent to $33.7 billion from $37.5 billion a year earlier. For April-August, imports fell 11.6 per cent to $168.6 billion from $190.7 billion in the year-ago period. Gold imports, however, jumped 140 per cent to $4.95 billion. \n\nAditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA, said the surge in gold imports was mainly due to a decline in prices of the commodity. Others attributed it to the coming festival season. \n\nOil imports declined 42.6 per cent year-on-year to $7.35 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in August last year. For April-August, these imports stood at $41.5 billion, down 38.8 per cent year-on-year. \n\nThough it might appear that industrial activity saw a turnaround, as non-oil imports rose 7.01 per cent to $26.4 billion in August, a closer look shows much of the growth is coming from gold imports. \n\nNon-oil, non-gold imports contracted 4.4 per cent, showing demand for industrial goods was yet to pick up, evident from the fact that the import of project goods almost halved to $206.7 billion in August. \n\nFor August, the trade deficit stood at $12.5 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in July. For April-August, the deficit stood at $57.5 billion, against $58.2 billion in the corresponding period of 2014. \n\n“The trade deficit isn’t providing a cushion anymore, which is beginning to be an uneasy factor. For the past two months, it is around $12 billion and this, coupled with the fact that the withdrawal by FIIs (foreign institutional investors) is depleting forex, is becoming a concern. Unfortunately, due to this, advantages from a fall in crude oil prices aren’t available to us,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings. \n\nIn August, goods that fared poorly in terms of exports included petroleum products, which declined 47.9 per cent to $2.77 billion. While exports of engineering goods fell 30 per cent, those of iron ore declined 34.3 per cent and electronic goods 17.4 per cent. Exporters said softening of the prices of key agricultural and industrial inputs, coupled with a contraction in global demand, was the primary reason behind the decline. \n\nThe Federation of Indian Export Organisations appealed to the government for “immediate introduction” of three per cent interest subvention and sought the commerce and industry minister’s intervention in the matter. \n\nIn a recent interaction with Business Standard, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the government would roll out the interest sbvention scheme soon. \n\n\n\tDuring the month, imports shrunk 9.9 per cent to $33.7 billion from $37.5 billion in August 2014. For April-August, imports fell 11.6 per cent to $168.6 billion from $190.7 billion in the year-ago period. \n \n\n\tHowever, gold imports jumped 140 per cent --- from $2.06 billion to $4.95 billion. \n \n\n\tAditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA, believes the surge in gold import is due to a decline in prices. \n \n\n\tThe trade deficit widened to $12.5 billion in August from $10.8 billion in the corresponding month last year. For April-August, the trade deficit was $57.5 billion, against $58.2 billion in the year-ago period. \n \n\n\t'The trade deficit isn't providing any cushion anymore, which is beginning to be an uneasy factor. For the past two months, it is at around $12 billion and this, coupled with the withdrawal of FIIs (foreign institutional investors), is causing depletion in forex and is a concern. Unfortunately, due to this, the advantages of a fall in crude prices aren't available to us,' said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings. \n \n\n\tHe added despite the rupee being the strongest among emerging market currencies, Indian exporters aren't able to avail of this due to shortage of demand. \n \n\n\tOil imports declined 42.6 per cent to $7.35 billion from $12.8 billion in August last year. For April-August, these imports stood at $41.5 billion, 38.8 per cent lower than $67.8 billion in the year-ago period. \n \n\n\tNon-oil import stood at $26.4 billion, 7.01 per cent more than $24.65 billion in August 2014. For the first five months of this financial year, non-oil imports were $127.1 billion, up 3.39 per cent year-on-year.
0862_1e0ddeb0-5cb1-49b9-a95d-072044ccb0fe	Tuesday, September 29, 2015, 12:29 a.m. – The Lord Jesus put in mind the song “Hear My Voice.” Speak, Lord, your words to my heart. I read Isaiah 37:23-27 (NASB). The Kiss (vv. 23-25) “Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! “Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest. ‘I dug wells and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.’ The Lord Jesus gave me a vision (illustration) early this morning of a man turning his back on his wife and, in front of her, giving his lover a big kiss on the lips. As I prayed concerning what this “Kiss” represents, I felt it was something political, like between heads of nations, so I looked it up. What I learned is that Leonid Brezhnev (Soviet Union/Russia) and Erich Honecker (East Germany) were photographed in a fraternal embrace (kiss) on October 7, 1979, as “a symbol of equality, fraternity and solidarity.” The photo was reproduced as a painting on the Berlin Wall in 1990 with the caption which read: “My God, help me to survive this deadly love affair.” “The socialist fraternal kiss or socialist fraternal embrace is a special form of greeting between the statesmen of Communist countries… When the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks” (Wikipedia). See also: http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/socialist-fraternal-kiss-leonid-brezhnev-erich-honecker-1979/. Although the news media likes to paint a picture of Obama and Putin at odds with each other, the Lord was giving me a picture of the two of them this morning as having participated with each other in this fraternal kiss, signifying solidarity in their communist beliefs and practices. These leaders are both part of the New World Order “beast,” and their goal is unified, which is to bring the world under the rule of this beast. Thus they have turned their backs on (abandoned, rejected) the people of their own nations and the people of this world. They are both part of the P5+1 (US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany) of the UN Security Council (New World Order “Sanhedrin”), which serves as the police force of the “beast” in forcing sovereign nations to comply with the New World Order, i.e. with this one-world communist regime, as well as to enforce a one-world religion which includes all people who reject the gospel of Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ as their Savior. Both leaders are in agreement with the method of rules of the New World Order, which the Lord also showed me as the head of a shadow prussianized army. Prussianized means, “authoritarian control and rigid discipline.” The face of this “authoritarian control” was that of Obama, i.e. he serves as the face of this shadow government (and military) which is controlling what goes on in the world from behind the scenes. He is one of their main voices (messengers) promoting and pushing this one world order and one world religion, along with Pope Francis. When he warned Putin that “dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world,” I believe he was making reference to this authoritarian control of the New World Order “beast” and its privatized military force which is lurking in the shadows, and which is a pervasive threat to the people of this world. Many times the Lord has given me a picture of this prussianized army as political spies, who could be members of our own families, neighbors, friends or people with whom we fellowship with in gatherings of the church. They work for the New World Order. They are against the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they are against those of us who hold to the truths of scripture, who teach Jesus Christ as the only way to heaven, and who preach repentance and submission (obedience) to God as part of the faith which saves us (See: Luke 9:23-25; Ac. 26:16-18; Ro. 6:1-23; 8:1-14; 2 Co. 5:15; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:17-24; Tit. 2:11-14; 1 Pet. 2:24-25; & 1 Jn. 1:5-9). And, they are plotting our demise. Their goal is to get the leaders of nations to divorce their own people and to marry the beast. The Congress of the USA has also “kissed” Obama, who is the face of this shadow government (New World Order), which is a communist, authoritarian regime which is taking over all nations and peoples and the church (institution). They have turned their backs on the American people in handing us over to this communist control of our nation. This “kiss” is just the beginning of this “deadly love affair” between heads of nations who have joined forces to bring the world under the submission of this beast (N.W.O.), and it will be disastrous for our nation and for the world – a very dark time in our history. Again, those of us who they consider “hard-liners” or “radicalized” or “extremists,” because we hold to the gospel of Jesus Christ, must be dealt with, to stop the spread of the gospel of salvation. Pope Francis is also another primary voice (face) of the New World Order who is going around the world preaching solidarity with this one-world government and religion and their goals. He, as well, has “kissed” this brotherhood of those who espouse communism. He, too, has turned his back on the people of the world. He, too, is a messenger for this “beast” and its plan to rule the world. News articles use such words to describe him as “masterful,” “fierce,” and “skillful” with a “softer style.” He has, and/or news articles about him have made reference to a “cultural war” or a “cultural revolution,” which the pope is promoting worldwide (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution). This revolution includes the persecution and killing of those who follow Jesus Christ and who preach the gospel. Pope Francis wants to do away with anything which divides the people of this world so that we all come together as one. His goal, too, is to have the leaders of nations divorce their people and marry the beast (New World Order). He wants all who profess the name of Christ to divorce Jesus and his gospel and to unite with the beast and his one-world government and religion (the synagogue of Satan). The real “climate change” he and others are talking about is this political climate change which is death to the old order of things so out of the ashes of the old order the phoenix (new order) can rise. When news stories mention the “international community,” they mean the “New World Order.” All this talk of global climate change is about change from the old world order to the new world order. The agreements they are trying to forge are those in which they get heads of nations to divorce their own people and marry the “beast.” Talks of “sustainable development” are really talks about this Cultural Revolution and getting people to conform to the N.W.O. There are many, many references to “unity,” “solidarity,” and “oneness,” in trying to get the people of the world to bow to the beast and to take its mark. They are forcing us to have to make a choice between the lives we now live (“business as usual”) and these transformed lives in cooperation and conformity to the “beast.” The “transition” they speak of is this transition from being married to “wife” to “lover.” This transformation involves changing our beliefs, values, behaviors, education, etc. This “alliance” they are trying to forge is this “kiss” of solidarity with the “beast.” So, be very discerning. It won’t be long before he roars his ugly head and the world is truly under his totalitarian rule. God Ordained It (vv. 26-27) “Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps. “Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up. All this is in God’s plan to judge his adulterous church and the people of this sinful world. None of this takes God by surprise. Now he is bringing it to pass. The “beast” thinks he did this, and so he lifts his head high, but God reminds him that he is merely an instrument of judgment in God’s hands, to work God’s will, and when God is finished with them (the beast and his messengers), God will take care to judge them, as well. So, we can take comfort in knowing that God is absolutely in control of all that is going on, that he has a purpose for it, and that one day our persecutors will be dealt with. Yet, I believe scripture teaches that God’s purpose in judging his adulterous people is to revive their hearts and to restore them to proper fellowship with him, and to see many people come to faith in Jesus Christ before our Lord returns. As well, our Lord will never leave us or forsake us. He will carry us through this dark time if we put our faith and trust in him, and lean on his everlasting arms. Hear my Voice / An Original Work / July 9, 2012 Based off Psalm 27 The Lord is my great salvation. He’s the stronghold of my life. When my enemies attack me, My heart will not fear at all. Though a war break out against me, Confident in Christ I’ll be. Of the Lord, I ask that I may Live with Him eternally. Hear my voice, Lord, when I call you. Merciful to me You’ll be. Though my relatives forsake me, My Lord God will receive me. Teach me Your way, O my Jesus. Lead me in Your righteousness. I will sacrifice to my Lord. I will sing with joyfulness. I am confident that I will See the goodness of the Lord. All the richness of His blessings, My Lord has for me in store. He asks me to be of courage; To be strong and to take heart, Patiently as I wait for Him, And from Him to ne’er depart. https://vimeo.com/119813963
0863_23a78a6d-fea1-4bc3-a1ab-c43208aacb75	An anti same-sex marriage group has marked Father's Day by releasing a video warning of the dangers of children growing up without Dads. \n\nAn Australian anti same-sex marriage group has marked Father's Day by releasing a video warning of the dangers of children growing up without Dads.\n\nThe 60-second long Marriage Alliance commercial uses American statistics to back its claims that children without fathers are more likely to drop out of school, run away from home, be involved in crime and end up in prison.\n\nIt describes fathers as "a girl's first love" and "a boy's first hero", and ends with the message: "Australia is facing same-sex marriage which rejects the necessity of fathers. Some children will never celebrate Father's Day."\n\nThe video has already been seen more than 11,000 times after being posted to Facebook.\n\nMarriage Alliance had urged supporters to share the clip as it wasn't certain TV stations would broadcast it.\n\nSpokeswoman Sophie York said same-sex couples were deliberately denying children their fundamental right to have a male and female role model.\n\n"Allowing same-sex marriage legitimises social engineering and promotes dysfunction and suffering for kids," she said.\n\n"The powerful and well-funded LGBT rights lobby is so focussed on their cause, they either forget about the rights of children who are the innocent victims of an unnatural parental union."\n\nA Google search for the phrase "statistics on children without fathers" brings up a link to an American blog called Fatherhood Factor, which lists many of the same statistics used in the Marriage Alliance ad.\n\nOne statistic – that 80 per cent of rapists came from a fatherless home – is credited to a 1978 study that found "80 per cent of rapists motivated with displaced anger come from fatherless homes".\n\nWhile the video did not mention divorce, death and other circumstances that might result in a child growing up without a father, Marriage Alliance said in its statement it did acknowledge those factors.\n\n"But deliberately putting a child into fatherless parental arrangement as occurs with a same-sex relationship or a legalised same-sex marriage means putting that child at extreme risk," it said.\n\n"It legitimises an increase in fatherless kids."\n\nHowever a 2014 review of social science literature into child wellbeing in same-sex parent families prepared for the American Sociological Association found "a clear consensus... that American children living within same-sex parent households fare just as well as those children residing within different-sex parent households over a wide array of well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse."\n\nIt further stated: "Differences that exist in child well-being are largely due to socioeconomic circumstances and family stability."\n\nA 2013 study on same-sex parented families by Child Family Community Australia (part of the federally-funded Australian Institute of Family Studies) concluded that research to date challenged the notion that they were harmful to children.\n\n"Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as their peers from heterosexual couple families," the report stated in its key messages.\n\n"Some researchers have concluded there are benefits for children raised by lesbian couples in that they experience higher quality parenting, sons display greater gender flexibility, and sons and daughters display more open-mindedness towards sexual, gender and family diversity."\n\nNeither the Marriage Alliance commercial nor the media release made any mention of whether children who grew up with two male parents would receive extra benefits from having two fathers.\n\nLike Brisbane Times on
0864_f4167c7d-5d81-487b-915b-8675419659cf	HONG KONG (CNNMoney) – “In the red corner, fighting for the Bank of New York Mellon, is Will ‘Tyrannosaurus’ Jefferies,” the announcer roared. \n\nJefferies emerged from behind a red curtain amid a cloud of smoke, bounding straight into the boxing ring as loud music pumped from speakers, strobe lights flashed overhead and models pranced around in bikinis. The spectators, decked out in tuxedos and colorful sequined gowns, went wild chanting his name. \n\nThis is Hong Kong’s “Hedge Fund Fight Nite,” a white-collar boxing competition and charity fundraiser that gets the city’s financiers out of the office and into the ring. With a couple of fights each year, it’s one of the hottest tickets in town. \n\n“A lot of the people in finance, who are young, determined and want to achieve a huge amount — boxing is a perfect discipline to learn and try,” said Rob Derry of Ironmonger, a fight organizer. “Hong Kong is a very transient place … it gives people who are here for three years something to focus on outside of work.” \n\nUnder a giant tent near Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor, punches went flying as 720 guests cheered for the boxers. The attendees — sitting at tables that cost HK$24,000 ($3,100) a pop — munched on crabmeat salad with mango, parma ham with cantaloupe, slow-roasted beef striploin and Earl Grey orange chocolate cake. \n\nBetween bites, they bid on expensive trips, private dinners, fine artworks and luxury diamond jewelry. \n\nBy the end of the night, the fight had raised HK$630,000 ($81,300). The proceeds benefit three charities — one that provides cleft palate surgery for kids, another that offers art therapy to victims of drugs, violence or sexual abuse, and a third that connects at-risk youth with police mentors. \n\nMost bouts were fun and exciting to watch, but a few took a turn for the worse. When Richard “The Stinger” Stevenson took a particularly big swing, he suffered a shoulder injury. The audience quickly hushed as judges declared the fight over. \n\nStevenson, who works for real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield, was ushered to the hospital, and is scheduled for shoulder reconstruction surgery in about a week. \n\nAnother bout was called off after Alex “Adults Only” Oxford of LexisNexis Risk Solutions lobbed a blow that gave his rival, Turiya Capital’s David “Amber Rain” Coates, a severe bloody nose. \n\nAs popular as these glitzy white-collar fights are, the boxers do fight at their own risk. While headgear and padded gloves offer some protection, injuries can happen in the ring — some even had to drop out of training after getting hurt. \n\nStill, it didn’t take long for things to swing back into gear. Models in silver gowns mingled with the wine-drinking black-tie crowd, which got rowdier as the night wore on. \n\nThe night’s only female bout featured Megan “Mega-hurtz” Schmalzried of Ernst & Young, and Tanya “The Mental” Menzel of Consulting Group International. \n\nSchmalzried’s friends were “really excited to see me punch someone,” she said during training. “I’m learning how to make yourself a smaller target … and it feels good when you can get a couple of hits on someone and make it hurt.” \n\nEven though “The Mental” went home with the win, Schmalzried said she’d do it all over again “in a heartbeat.”
0865_5b654d38-f5d6-42d4-8231-4211619004c7	Bali Tourism at the Crossroads? Brahman ladies carry offerings into the Payadnyan at the big Maligia Geria Pidada in Sidemen, East Bali 20 September 2015\nThere is an odd article on the front page of today’s Bali Post suggesting that 64% of Balinese now want a ‘re-assessment’ of tourism goals, with more emphasis on cultural tourism. Obviously the 64% are not aware of the governor’s call for ‘urban tourism’ nor have they seen the uncouth hordes — hell bent on cheap beads ‘n’ beer  —  flooding in on the budget airlines. Bit hard to reverse the trend: cultural tourism has become a culture of tourism.\nOne can’t easily demolish the hundred or so culture neutral budget hotels that have sprung up in the green belts along the highways and in the jam-packed back lanes of Legian-Seminyak. •    •    • In a separate but related  development, there are calls on social media for village chiefs to be more mindful of Hindu hotel-employees work schedules when demanding attendance at temple festivals. This is in response to recent recruitment ads in the papers placed by hotels and such which make ‘Non-Hindu’ a condition of employment.\nWhat tourists originally came to see in Bali — the Hindu rituals — has now become an impediment to urban tourism. Very odd.\nMeanwhile the Balinese are ramping up their spiritual tourism: many now enjoying regular Yatra pilgrimages to Hindu temples in Lombok and Java, to ease the pain of a life on the juice blender. •    •    • Last month saw a heightening of interest, amongst the island’s Hindu and non-Hindu population, in festivals of a secular nature: The kite festivals, Sanur Village Festivals, the body music festival, the Ubud’s Yoga Hag (saggy tits and high colonics), to mention just a few.\nI document Balinese fashion trends, including the use of the weapons-grade breast broach, the cherry red tulle trains from hell and the general stampede for Ice Capade outfits.\nIn Java, at the same time, the local women-folks have been slowly weaned out of their saucy sarung-kebaya Javanese  traditional dress and into white poatato-sack moo-moo daywear, or into Rio Carnival confectionary for trumped-up festival wear such as the Batik, Butterfly and Blue Brand Margarine festivals now held in Java regularly.\nStrange times indeed. Fake Festival fashion of the third kind. Scary Amongst the plethora of fake festivals with all their padding and pyrotechnics there is sometimes a quite purely authentic Balinese ceremony and it is to these that am drawn, like an old die-hard moth to a pre-mass tourism lantern.\nI pick through the glam-brams and Ksatria Kardashians to find the true heart of Bali, the tastefully adorned centrum.\nI was rewarded last month with a Baris Gede warrior dance of unspeakable beauty at a $300,000 temple festival in Sidakarya, just outside Sanur — oh the feigning of the warrior-dancers it made your mother’s knees go week — and a 300 soul strong Baligyapurification ritual in the Brahman stronghold of Sidemen in East Bali.\nNow read on: 1 September 2015: To the Denpasar Brahman palace of Tampakgangsul for the start of an old friend’s soul purification rites\nI knew high priest Ida Pedanda Gede Karang through all his incarnations: as tourism pioneer, hotelier, bon vivant and finally as slightly dotty high priest. He had been my Balinese mum’s lover when they were teenagers when he was known as Gus Pung.\nA few months ago I attended his magnificent 21-gun salute cremation: today is the start of the next stage in his soul progress towards deification. •    •    • I arrive a bit late at the palace and see the tail end of a procession of 300 white umbrellas in the distance, heading west towards the setting sun.\nI race down the street, following the crowded, in my white pumps. I cross the Denpasar river bridge and I suddenly find myself in the forecourt of Denpasar’s most magnificent Majapahait-era palace, Puri Agung Jero Kuta. 300 plus pengiring (followers) are sitting in neat rows on the courtyard’s grass floor around a banyan tree. In the court’s gamelan pavilion I see my friends, including the deceased’s widow Pedanda Isteri, former society beauty Ibu Kompiang, and her very extended and very good-looking family.\nA gamelan and an angklung alternate in filling the heady ceremonial air with gorgeous music. I find a back court where Brahmans are downing pegs of Glenfiddich.  I indulge in a heavily laced Irish coffee then move back to the ceremonial court now bustling with activity. The high priest, Ida Pedanda Timbul from Sanur, has ceased his Vedic incantations and is busy plucking leaves from the banyan tree with a long bamboo pole. These leaves are then distributed amongst the pengiring to be fashioned, later in the week, into spirit effigies — then cremated, and the ashes thrown into the sea.\nThe procession home is one of the prettiest I have ever witnessed: The bleganjur marching band is animated and the rows of Gucci sunglasses are glistening as the ribbon of 300 umbrellas weaves back to the Brahman home. At the palace the pengiring placed the silver bowls of banyan leaves in rows in the ‘grandstand’ with in the sacred enclosure — called  payadnyan — that has been erected in the banjar hall opposite the palace. The family’s head then leads me to the high tea table where a bevy of beauties are scoffing packages of Nasi Yasa, ceremonial rice. I feel blessed. Ngangget Don Bingin ceremony\nGeria Gde Karang, Tampakgangsul, Denpasar, 1 September 2015 •    •    • Baligia ceremony, Geria Gde Karang,\nTampakgangsul, Denpasar, 4 September 2015 •    •    • VALE\nJean Lane Murniati\n26 December 1948 – 25 August 2015 Jean was the nicest expat lady in Kuta, all these years. She came in the early 1970s and married dashing Ketut Sulendra and together with Ketut’s mother they founded Bali’s first juice bar, TITIMAS, in Denpasar, on the bridge in front of the Kusumasari market. It was ground zero hippy heaven and poste restante for all of us back then, when Denpasar was the only place to buy punnets of white hamburger bun, blue brand margarine and make phone calls home.\nJean went on to found Kubu Krishna and then T J.s in Poppies Lane and to make beautiful jewelry and to paint (she recently illustrated a book with actress/ author Jennifer Claire). She was loved by all.\nKetut left Jean — with a son, Wayan Krishna lane — and moved to Australia, but all her myriad friends stayed close: she was a permanent court fixture at expat events for almost 40 years.\nHer passing after a long battle with cancer brings great sorrow to the old timer community and her big Balinese family. She never wanted to trouble anyone with her health problems over the last year.\nJean is survived by her son, two grand-daughters and a grandson.

But principal Briony Scott needn't have worried - she taught them to be brave. \n\nWhen she told her students she had been diagnosed with cancer, Wenona school principal Briony Scott assured them she was "full to the brim of hope".\n\nThis week she was also full of pride, after her young charges led the school community in making a heartfelt video tribute to her on YouTube.\n\n"Why be a principal?" Dr Scott tweeted, posting a link to the video. "In 2014, we talked about being brave. All year. In 2015, the students reminded me of all they'd learnt. This is why.

0873_b0981f0e-3076-496d-b09a-effa25d90535	VATICAN VITY: Pope Francis on Tuesday called on the rich and powerful to take care of Earth as he launched a day of global prayer ahead of key meetings on climate change. \n \nThe pontiff, speaking at St. Peter's Basilica, asked God to enlighten "those who hold power and money so that they avoid the sin of indifference... and take care of the world we inhabit." \n \nHis comments came in the first celebration of "World Day for Prayer for the Care of Creation," which the pontiff created to boost support for the environment. \n \nFrancis has become a leading defender of green causes, particularly in the fight against climate change, and is due to address the UN Special Summit on Sustainable Development this month in New York. \n \nUN members will gather in Paris from November 30 to December 11 in a bid for a deal to cap heat-trapping carbon emissions, the driver of man-made climate change. \n \nThe goal is to limit the temperature rise by by two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels, but the negotiations have proved long and hard. \n \nA crunch round of talks opened in the western German city of Bonn Monday, with delegates facing a sprawing 83-page draft of sometimes contradictory proposals. \n \nOn Monday, US President Barack Obama described climate change as an "urgent and growing" challenge that would define this century. \n \n"Human activity is disrupting the climate, in many ways faster than we thought," he said. \n \n"The deniers are increasingly alone, on their own shrinking island. \n \n"The science is stark, it is sharpening, and it proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present." - AFP 
0874_b595873f-9190-44d7-ad98-ff413bc2b19f	You have a special function coming up very soon but the venue that was chosen is very drab and plain. The best method of jazzing up the area is to utilize a decorative event planning company from Boston, MA. These companies can come in to the facility and turn your party or gathering into a fantastic work of art in a very short time. Table-length cloths and elegant chair covers complete with contrasting sashes can instantly revive and refresh an area. They are available in a variety of prints and solids from jewel tones to leopard prints. Select the colors that coordinate with a bride’s color selections, a company’s logo or a bat mitzvah theme. Use different colors of skirting for the head table, gift table, buffets and the sign-in table at the door for an elegant and inviting look. Ruffle or drape the contrasting linens on the table tops for even more color and contrast. Match these different but necessary table set-ups to the guest seating and table linens for a coordinated decor. Use pipe draping of velvet or other materials behind a set of risers or band set-up. This will absolutely transform a plain, dull back wall. Drapery can be utilized just for the back of the staging or across the entire wall for a very finished decor. Add spotlights to put a beam on the important members of the program or band so the guests will know who and what to focus their attention on. Up-lighting can be used to create an even more dramatic atmosphere. Swag large ribbons across the ceiling to make the large room more festive. Scatter regular columns or columns of beads to make a large area even more inviting. A room will appear more cozy and intimate and less cavernous and large. Add paper lanterns for a festive and inviting feel. The varieties of centerpieces that can be used is limitless. Some very formal examples would include those made out of ice sculptures or exotic flowers. More playful centerpieces would include those constructed of balloon art, feathers, or pinatas. A reputable company would have several to choose from, depending on the type of function. For the more upscale parties, chargers can be added to the place settings for extra punch. Outdoor events such as weddings will shine with such additions as arches and columns. Chairs can be decorated with swags of colorful blooms and blooming plants added around the area for more color. Indoor parties will come to life with color schemes and props for birthdays and children’s events. For example, south-of-the-border themed gatherings will look authentic with Mexican props such as sombreros, paper flowers, pinatas, and colorful blankets as ceiling, table and wall decor. Utilizing a business like this to assist you with your party will ensure a quality and original result. Everything will blend and give you a function that will be a memorable event that will be remembered for weeks. If you utilize their props, equipment, decorations, lighting and unlimited services, you will learn how to put on many different types of functions and gatherings in the future. We offer the most reliable decorative event planning at your disposal. Find out everything you need to know about our catering services from our website at http://www.stiritupcuisine.com today.

0875_c528a26a-a701-42e0-9fe4-90a463906868	BOCA RATON, Fla. — The football stadium at Florida Atlantic opened in 2011, and has already seen a handful of significant events.\n\nThing is, very few of them involved football.\n\nFlorida State won the national championship in women's Division I soccer there last December, a couple weeks before FAU played host to the inaugural Boca Raton Bowl. The U.S. men's national soccer teams have played there a handful of times — World Cup star Carli Lloyd, longtime American standout Abby Wambach and Boca Raton native Jozy Altidore have all scored at FAU while wearing the red, white and blue.\n\nBut Friday night is FAU's chance to shine, when the Owls (0-1) host Miami (1-0). The biggest home crowd in FAU history is expected, about 30,000 in a stadium that hasn't seen 10,000 on some game days. It's a perfect scenario for FAU, the classic trade-off of having everything to gain and very little to lose.\n\n"We understand it's the game that can move us up and have us shock the world," said FAU's Greg Howell, who ran for 138 yards and two touchdowns in the Owls' loss at Tulsa on Saturday. "We don't harp on it too much, haven't been doing a lot of 'Miami this, Miami that.' It's not like that. But we know what time it'll be when it comes to that game and we'll handle our business."\n\nIt carries personal significance to Howell. He went to high school in Coral Gables, just a couple miles from the University of Miami. One of the players he modeled his game after while growing up was former Miami star Clinton Portis. Howell even had some thoughts about playing his college ball for the Hurricanes, which made sense given his desire to stay close to home.\n\nInstead, he'll now try to beat them.\n\n"I want them to enjoy this," FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. "This is one of those moments that I want them to embrace it, to enjoy it and prepare with that kind of embrace as well."\n\nPartridge is seeking some sense of normalcy amid the hubbub that's sweeping his campus this week, and 45 miles to the south Miami coach Al Golden is finding himself in a similar situation.\n\nThe Hurricanes know this game is a big deal for the Owls. Golden would rather Miami take a business-as-usual approach.\n\n"We're just excited about the opportunity to play again. That's it," said Golden, whose team hosted FAU in 2013 and won 34-6. "The rest of it, we really don't want to get involved in. We want to be a consistent team. We want to focus on what we can control and do the things that we have to do to be consistent and improve every day. We know who we're playing. We know the energy they're going to have. We know the challenge that awaits us."\n\nThere's more than 50 players on the FAU roster who hail from South Florida locales. It's not unusual for Miami to see opponents from the talent-rich area every week, so they know it's a big deal for players from their backyard to face off against the Hurricanes.\n\n"It's going to be a great crowd, our fans, their fans," Miami running back Mark Walton said. "What we've got to do is not pay attention to the hype and go out there and just play football."\n\nEven the FAU players who didn't grow up around Miami understand the significance.\n\n"It's going to be big for people in this area," said FAU quarterback Jaquez Johnson, a native of Starkville, Mississippi. "I'm not really from this area but for me, it's still a big game. I played them my first year here and I'm looking forward to playing them again and having a better chance in the game."\n\nOddsmakers don't give FAU much of a chance: The Owls are 17-point underdogs.\n\nThat doesn't matter to Howell.\n\n"This is the game that I know everybody from my neighborhood is going to watch, no matter what," Howell said. "It's the game that everybody's eyes are going to be on me and our team."
0876_bc72793d-97a1-4dec-a86f-fddd5ca2432a	The new sony HT-XT3 review TrustedReviews – TrustedReviews September 29, 2015 \n\nGoogle Planning to Launch Premium Pixel C Tablet With Android Marshmallow … – International Business Times  September 29, 2015 \n\nPs 4: what’s The new sony offering for 2015? – Express.co.united kingdom  September 29, 2015 \n\nThe Logitech G410 will hit the U.S. and Europe in October. Return soon for much deeper impressions. \n\nBeing something for that gaming crowd, the G410 also packs inside a bevy of lights. Yes, they are still a little garish, but they are also greater than mere decoration. Designers might have specific aspects of their games activate different regions of the laptop keyboard — for instance, they are able to ensure secrets illuminate just like a speedometer for any racing game (something one clients are already doing). If you have other Logitech G products, such as the G633 headset and G303 mouse, you may also sync up all their lighting. \n\nMechanical keyboards are not just for old-fashioned PC customers any longer — they have also become fairly well-liked by laptop computer gaming crowd. The down-side for those that glorious, mechanical keyboard feedback? They are usually pretty hefty. Logitech seeks to solve this problem using the G410 Atlas Spectrum TKL ($130), a gaming keyboard that eschews the best-hands number pad for any slimmer design. In comparison to some mechanical keyboards, additionally, it does not possess a metal plate inside, which adds a great deal of weight. Logitech claims its Romer-G mechanical switches permit the G410 to join up key presses 25 % quicker than other mechanical keyboards, and they are also made to withstand 70 million keystrikes (around 40 % greater than your competition). At 1.8 pound, the G410 is half the load of Logitech’s bigger G910 keyboard, which makes it a much more sensible choice for carrying. \n\nI have grown accustomed to the flatter, chiclet-style keyboards which are nearly everywhere nowadays, but typing around the G410 cut back a number of my earliest PC reminiscences. There is the perfect quantity of “oomph” after i attempted typing a couple of sentences. Exploring the field of The Witcher 3 using the G410 also felt significantly diverse from my existing wireless mouse and keyboard setup. I am less than confident that it seems sensible to really write with mechanical keyboards any longer (thought I understand lots of people who recommend them), but I saw the way the extra feedback in the G410 might make games much more rewarding (even when it is a purely mental bonus).
0877_f4fe8969-8534-4104-b405-e1b28cc247ab	A FORMER fly-in fly-out worker convicted of murdering a man who had a threesome with his girlfriend will spend at least 17 years behind bars.  \n   \nRYAN Christopher Hawke was found guilty in the West Australian Supreme Court of murdering 50-year-old Mark Koller at the Crystal Brook Caravan Park in Orange Grove in April last year. \nHawke, 34, admitted stabbing the father of three but claimed he expected the confrontation would only be a fist fight and brought a knife with him to defend himself. The court heard Mr Koller was repeatedly stabbed, with the knife penetrating his heart twice to a depth of 18cm and 15cm. During sentencing on Wednesday, Hawke's defence lawyer John Prior said his client was angered when he returned home from work on an offshore oil rig and was told by his de facto that she'd had sex with Mr Koller and his partner. Mr Prior said she had also told his client that Mr Koller had a gun and had threatened the couple. The pair, who met during drug rehabilitation, had binged on methylamphetamines, heroin, benzodiazapines and alcohol for eight days in the lead-up to the attack. While he hadn't taken drugs that day, Hawke was affected by a substantial amount of alcohol when he made a last minute decision to take a knife as he left his caravan. "It was a spur of the moment decision to arm himself with the knife," Mr Prior said. "There was no intention to kill the deceased before he left the unit. Events escalated very quickly." The court heard the victim had fought back during the incident, which lasted no more than 10 minutes. Before Hawke fled the scene, he bent over and apologised to Mr Koller as he lay on the ground bleeding. Hawke, a father of four, also said "I'm sorry" as he was led out of the courtroom following his guilty verdict. Justice Ralph Simmonds concluded that Hawke was remorseful and had formed intent to kill on the spur of the moment, but it was a serious case of murder. Hawke, who has already been in jail for about a year-and-a-half, must serve a minimum of 17 years behind bars before being eligible for parole. Speaking outside court, the victim's brother Michael Koller told reporters he hoped Hawke would use his time in prison to reflect on his actions and rehabilitate himself. "There's no winners in this - his family is destroyed just as much as ours is," Mr Koller said. "It's a tragic situation. Again, drugs has risen its ugly head."

And the death we're going to treat as a homicide,” JSO Sgt. C.H. Ford said. \n\n\nWhen officials arrived they said it was hard to tell how long the body had been there. \n\n\nWorkers in the area said they weren’t shocked to hear about the body because they said they witnessed a drive-by shooting nearby on Monday. \n\n\nOne of those workers, who asked to only be identified as Dee, said he saw a man and woman walking along the railroad tracks Monday when someone inside a car drove by and opened fire as the couple ran away. \n\n\n“A Dodge Charger stopped and started firing at the two and the passenger was also firing at the two and they fired about 20 rounds and took off,” Dee said. “I think that it might be related. I think that one got hit and went down the railroad tracks and maybe bled to death or something.” \n\n\nPolice haven’t confirmed if the two incidents are related and a press conference given about the body made no mention of a drive-by shooting but officials said a homicide unit is working with crime scene technicians and the medical examiner's office to recover evidence as officials check missing persons reports.

The 550-page Harper review of competition laws, which Labor claims has been "punted off into the never never" due to divisions in the Abbott cabinet, cost $3 million in salaries and travel costs alone for the expert panel and 16 bureaucrats supporting them. The four-member panel, led by economist Ian Harper, was paid $466,000 in sitting fees during a six-month nationwide consultation phase that included public hearings, business forums and a specially convened conference.\n\nMr Harper was paid $1500 a day and his three fellow panellists — Peter Anderson, Su McCluskey​ and Michael O'Bryan​ — received $1000 a day, according to answers to questions on notice from the Senate.\n\nThe panel charged another $146,000 for flights and $11,000 for meals and received $15,000 in travel allowances.\n\nThe salaries of the 16-person secretariat drawn from Treasury and other departments would have cost $2.4 million, according to a breakdown of their pay brackets supplied by Small Business Minister Bruce Billson. Members of the secretariat charged $200,000 in flights, hotels and travel allowances.\n\nAnother $15,000 was spent printing 300 copies of the review and $450 on two "pull-up banners" promoting the review.\n\nMr Billson was left red-faced this week when the major recommendation from the Harper review was shelved amid cabinet tensions and resistance from big business.\n\nThe Small Business Minister was pushing the panel's recommendation for an "effects test" to be added to competition laws to prevent conduct by firms with market dominance from lessening competition.\n\nThe provision would bring Australia in line with 127 of 129 countries with competition laws but it was bitterly opposed by the Business Council of Australia and companies such as Coles and Woolworths.\n\nMr Billson would likely have been rolled by his colleagues if the recommendation was voted on\n\nAllan Fels, the former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission wrote this week that big business' success in stifling implementation of an effects test "likely sinks acceptance and implementation of the other 55 Harper recommendations which constitute a blueprint for far-reaching, productivity-enhancing competition reforms affecting the whole economy".\n\nBut Mr Billson told Fairfax Media on Friday that the effects test was just one of 56 recommendations and he would have more to say in coming weeks.\n\nHe said the panel represented "exceptional value for money" and ensured that voices outside of big business were heard in the review process.\n\nShadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said it was concerning that the panel's final report had gathered dust for six months so far.\n\n"In that time the government has found time to wage war on the ABC, run a loopy campaign against the renewable energy sector and block marriage equality. Yet it hasn't managed to respond to a key report which lays out serious options to boost Australia's economic growth," he said.\n\nThe Harper review is clearly being punted off into the never-never because cabinet can't agree."\n\nFollow us on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0880_ca99bdb1-ff90-4790-a012-bdd27abc4439	There comes a moment in every person’s life that changes the way people look at them. Skydiver Shital Mahajan is also an idol of such heroism. Holder of five world records, 14 national records and bestowed upon with Padam Shri in 2011, but Shital is still an unknown figure in India. \n\nShe is well known internationally for her skills but what hurts Shital the most is the lack of recognition in her own country. Having performed more than 655 jumps, adventure sports enthusiast Shital is a skydiving coach too. United States Parachuting Association has certified her with A, B, C and D licenses and coach ratings, which makes her eligible for skydiving all over the globe. But she still excessively depends on sponsors to stay in the sport and continues to plead the government for support. \n\nShe is known internationally for her skydiving achievements and even bestowed upon with a Padma Shri, but still Shital has no prominence among the Indian sports fraternity.\n \nIn an exclusive chat with IBNLive , the adventure-loving  Shital shared her sentiments and aspirations to do her country more proud. \n\nWhen and how you thought of starting skydiving? And how you turned professional in this adventure sport? \n\nI started skydiving in the year 2002. I deliberately wanted to do something different. In our society, there is a taboo that a girl can't do this and that. I wanted to erase that stereotypical image of a woman from people's mind. They think a woman is supposed to serve her family, raise kids and only do household work. When I started to face similar challenges, I decided to break barriers. \n\nThen I happened to meet one of my friends' brother, Air Force officer Kamal Singh. I came to know about skydiving from him only. Then I took coaching from him. I wanted to do skydiving so I asked him how can I start. His answer was "since you are a civilian, you need to go abroad for skydiving as it cannot be done in India." \n\nThen I decided if I have no choice than to go abroad to learn, then why not at a special place like the North Pole. \n\n\n\nDoes your family support you since it involves a lot of money and one has to risk his/her life? \n\nMy parents didn't support me initially but later on I convinced them. When I asked them I want to do skydiving, their answer was “have you gone mad! In our family no one has even travelled in an aircraft and you want to jump from it!" They said girls can't do such dares. But I had a strong determination, so I convinced them. I clearly said, it's my life and if I were to die, it will solely be my responsibility. They said "we can't allow you to risk your life". Then I started blackmailing tactics (laughs) by threatening to leave home. Girls leave their home for marriage, but I wanted to leave to sky-dive. \n\nTell us something about your awards and records. \n\nPresently I have 14 national and 5 world records in my name. On 18th April 2004, I became the first woman in the world to execute a sky-dive from North Pole, and that too without any prior training. There wasn't any land for my landing, so I had to land on an ice slope in a freezing temperature of minus 37 degrees, from a height of 2400 feet. Following my first world record, in the year 2006, I became first woman to perform sky fall from both South Pole and North Pole. Chasing achievements and records, the biggest accolade in my career came my way in the year 2011 when I was awarded the fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, from the then President Pratibha Patil. \n\n\n\nWe heard that your meeting with former President Late Late APJ Abdul Kalam had a touch of both sorrow and happiness attached to it. \n\nAfter my North Pole achievement, the Russian government approved me with a certificate recognising my feat, but the Indian government didn't accept my accomplishment. \n\nThen Sports Minister, Late Sunil Dutt, said: "There is no value of such certificates in India". They weren't ready to recognise my achievement. The government asked me to contact the Air Force and they sent me back to the Sports Ministry that said skydiving is not considered a sport in India. \n\nI was heartbroken, so I decided to meet the then President, APJ Abdul Kalam. I showed him all my certificates and told him how the Sports Ministry is refusing to recognise my achievement. He said "I, the President of India, recognise your world record. Now whose recognition do you need?" \n\nAPJ said: "My secretary Ashish is here. If you get stuck in any situation, give him a call. We are always here to support you." He was an amazing personality. \n\nWhere do you mostly practice skydiving? \n\nI usually practice skydiving in Spain, Finland, California and Arizona (USA). There are still no proper rules and regulations for skydiving in India. I want to make all this possible in India one day. \n\n\n\nWhat safety measures you take for skydiving? \n\nFAI (Federation of Aeronautics International) is the world regulatory body for skydiving. It has set up some rules and safety measures that every skydiver has to follow. Special suits are used for skydiving that are wind proof, even protect the body in negative temperature, where body contact with open air can lead to blood clots. \n\nWhen you perform a jump from 11,000 feet, only 40 seconds are there to open the parachute as you fall with a speed of 230 kmph. At this speed in a temperature like -38 degrees, hypothermia may take over the body. Our suits protect us from all this. Beneath that we wear four T-shirts and four pants, besides a  helmet, two face covers and medical tapes all over the body. Only the nostrils are left open to breathe. \n\nWhat runs through your mind when you are in mid-air? \n\nIn skydiving, you have just a 40-second timeframe mid-air. Either you can think or you can land safely. I give all the credit of safe landings to my subconscious mind. \n\nWhile in the air, even 4-5 seconds are precious and it can affect badly. Therefore, only subconscious mind works at that point of time. \n\nTell us about your institute - the Phoenix Skydiving Academy. \n\nThe Maharashtra Government suggested me to open a skydiving institute in Pune. It had my roots, where I could teach and perform skydiving. So I started the Phoenix Skydiving Academy. We are active in four states - Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. \n\nWhat is the average expense one needs to bear for skydiving? \n\nThe expense of one jump is 20 dollar in US but in India it costs 20-22 thousand rupees. We, at our institute, are trying hard to bring it to a nominal price of 9-10 thousand rupees. \n\n\n\nWhat are your aspirations regarding skydiving? \n\nI am planning for a sky fall from Australia along with hundred plus Indians. I want to associate more and more people with skydiving in India so that we can come up as a big powerhouse. I want to popularise skydiving as a sport in India. \n\nWho do you consider as your inspiration? And how do you see future generation’s interest towards skydiving? \n\nCurrent generation is very active and they are ready for adventure sports. A lot of enthusiasts want to get trained for skydiving. My inspiration is Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld (world skydiving champion, coach, author, speaker), and I feel good when my students seek inspiration from my achievement. \n\n           \t\n\n\n   \n  More from this Section

She’s promising to take a hardline on the regime in Tehran.\nHowever, during her time as the chief executive of HP, she “sold hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of products to Iran through a foreign subsidiary, despite strict U.S. export sanctions,” Bloomberg reports. While running the show at HP, Fiorina thwarted sanctions by dealing with Iran through European and Middle Eastern companies, allowing for the tech company to dominate the market in Tehran. By 2007, HP-made printers accounted for 41 percent of the total market share in the country, the report states.\nFiorina’s dealings with Iran were established thanks to a 1997 agreement made between the U.S. company and the Indian-owned, Dubai-based Redington Gulf. As Bloomberg’s Josh Rogin writes, HP was engaging in potentially illegal activity, as U.S. companies were prohibited from exporting to Iran thanks to two executive orders signed by President Bill Clinton in 1995. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started to inquire about HP’s activities overseas following a 2008 Boston Globe exposé that tracked the company’s dealings with Iran. HP responded, denying that it had thwarted the law, but admitting that the company had sold $120 million dollars worth of products to Redington Gulf, which then sent the products to Iran. Fiorina’s previous dealings with Iran were brought up when she ran for the California Senate in 2010. At the time, her campaign spokeswoman denied that HP had committed any wrongdoing while she was CEO. “It is illegal for American companies to do business in Iran. To her knowledge, during her tenure, HP never did business in Iran and fully complied with all U.S. sanctions and laws,” the spokeswoman said, according to the report.But later in the campaign, the Republican candidate changed her tone on the matter, telling the Lady Globes magazine that technology could help Iran reengage with the world. “But isn’t it wonderful that Dell PCs and Apple iPhones are in Iran, because this is why we know that a woman has been condemned to be stoned to death because she is accused of adultery… The knowledge that we gain about was going on there is important. It gives us a human face on a brutal regime,” Fiorina said.From 1999-2004, when Carly was serving as HP’s chief executive, the company’s lobbying arm consistently pushed for “unilateral sanctions reform legislation,” Bloomberg found.
0882_487ee9fa-987e-42b8-8ead-0db2a4ae36a8	I was interested to read the paper by Joseph Prandota and colleagues [1] who observed that: "latent chronic T. gondii [Toxoplasma gondii] infection have an important impact on triggering and development of ASD [autism spectrum disorders], at least in a subset of autistic children, and this requires some modification(s) of its diagnostic procedures and treatment regimens." Big words, I'm sure you'll agree.\nFrom the start I'll indicate that I'm interested in T. gondii on this blog. This parasitic protozoan is one of nature's survivors (and thrivers) with effects that may go far beyond your ordinary parasite. Aside from potentially making rats attracted to cats (or cat urine), I've been particularly interested in the collected research looking at a possible association between T. gondii and the presentation of schizophrenia (see here for example). The idea that infection with T. gondii under the right circumstances may be associated with a condition as complicated as schizophrenia is not without its critics, but in a world of increasing pluralisation of such labels (see here) I'd be minded to keep T. gondii on the research agenda (see here) for now.\nThe Prandota findings, based on a small-ish group of children diagnosed with ASD living in Egypt, take things one step further when it comes to T. gondii and it's potentially wide-ranging effects. Working with the aim to "estimate the seroprevalence of chronic toxoplasmosis among autistic children" researchers set about assaying for "anti-T. gondii IgG antibody seroposivity" alongside a couple of other parameters including "serum levels of IFN-g and nitric oxide (NO) in T. gondii-positive and T. gondii-free patients." I might add that a positive anti-T. gondii IgG result indicates previous exposure to T. gondii. It does not necessarily mean current or on-going infection which can only be reliably ascertained via other tests (see here).\nResults: "11 (29.3%) out of the 46 autistic children... were positive for serum anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies as compared with 2 patients (4%) with toxoplasmosis found among 50 control children." Age was one of the parameters that seemed to play a role in infection history which kinda stands to reason (the older you are, the more likely that you have an exposure). Further: "Autistic children with toxoplasmosis had markedly increased both serum IFN-g and NO concentrations... as compared with the values obtained in patients without toxoplasmosis."\nI don't want to over-analyse the Prandota results at this stage in terms of what elevations of IFN-γ and NO might mean to T. gondii infection in autism, so I won't. The authors go into some detail about immune function, tryptophan metabolism and even glutathione gets a mention in relation to these issues, but I'd prefer to stick to the T. gondii estimates for now.\nAs far as I can see, this is one of the first times that T. gondii infection has been discussed with autism in mind. That over a quarter of cases in the Prandota sample were found to have been in immunological contact with the protozoan is interesting and suggests that further independent investigations should be initiated in this area. I would, for example, be interested to know whether such findings are transferable to other geographical sites? Does cat ownership show any link to findings as per some discussions in schizophrenia (see here)? Are there any links with other 'autism-related' issues as suggested by Abdoli & Dalimi [2]? And, with some of my own research interests in mind (see here) could such findings further extend the observations of Emily Severance and colleagues [3] talking about T. gondii infection and "sensitivity to gluten" beyond schizophrenia (see here)? Well, it's not as if anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG) are strangers to [some] autism (see here).\nAs for treating any on-going toxoplasmosis, well in the US at least, this might just have got a little bit more expensive...\nQuestions (and answers) remain.\nMusic: Artful Dodger - Movin' Too Fast.\n----------\n[1] Prandota J. et al.

0883_bef8e156-4292-474f-8f40-932893f284e7	Here's a trivia question: If the Toronto Blue Jays make the postseason for the first time since 1993, who will have baseball's longest playoff drought? \n\nThat would be the Seattle Mariners, who haven't made it since winning a record-tying 116 games in 2001. \n\nThese are exciting times for franchises that haven't had much recent success. Kansas City, of course, won the American League pennant last year after going nearly three decades without a playoff appearance, and there are several teams trying to snap shorter-but-still-significant dry spells in 2015. \n\nThe Blue Jays lead the AL East, and Houston leads the AL West. The Astros haven't made the postseason since 2005. \n\nMiami (2003) owns the longest NL drought, and the Marlins are 23 games under .500. But the New York Mets (2006) lead the NL East and the Chicago Cubs (2008) are in good position for a wild card. \n\nWith the expanded postseason, it will probably become increasingly rare for a team to go more than a decade without appearing in the playoffs, so perhaps the Marlins, San Diego Padres (2006) and Chicago White Sox (2008) will be back before too long. \n\nHere are a few other developments from around baseball: \n\nLATE-INNING STRATEGY \n\nOne of the most discussed aspects of bullpen management is what to do when the game is tied and you're on the road. A manager will sometimes hold his closer back in these situations, not wanting to use him unless there's a lead — even if an inferior reliever might give up the winning run before the closer ever gets a chance to pitch. \n\nWe've seen plenty of this in the NL East race lately. Washington lost 8-5 at St. Louis on Tuesday when Brandon Moss hit a ninth-inning homer off Casey Janssen. The Nationals used six relievers in that game, but Jonathan Papelbon was not among them. \n\nThe Mets lost in walk-off fashion at Miami on Friday and Sunday, with closer Jeurys Familia not appearing in either game. Familia, in fact, hasn't pitched since last Monday. \n\nFANTASY FOCUS \n\nCorey Seager already has a couple two-hit games after being called up by the Los Angeles Dodgers late last week. The 21-year-old prospect has played both shortstop and third base for Los Angeles. \n\nThe Cubs called up an infield prospect of their own in Javier Baez. He hit nine home runs in 52 games last year but batted only .169 with 95 strikeouts. If Baez gets his strikeouts under control, he has good power potential for a middle infielder. \n\nLINE OF THE WEEK \n\nIf it feels like this award goes to a pitcher more often than not, that's just the state of baseball in 2015. Teams are averaging 4.23 runs per game this year — up a bit from the 2014 average of 4.07, but well below the average of 5.14 back in 2000. \n\nThis week's honoree is Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers, who struck out 15 in a 132-pitch complete game against San Francisco on Wednesday. Los Angeles won that game 2-1 to wrap up a three-game sweep of the Giants. The Dodgers now lead second-place San Francisco by 7 1/2 games in the NL West. \n\nIt was a massive performance by Kershaw in a crucial game in the middle of a pennant race — an outing worth remembering the next time his postseason resume is being picked apart.
0884_feb10e73-f791-4686-945d-f17c6a0bedbd	Portland, Oregon, Sept. 15, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading web solutions provider Dealer Spike offers top-notch search engine marketing tools for its customers, operated by its Google Adwords-certified team of SEM specialists. Dealerships see a measurable return on investment for advertising directly to their perfect prospects. Dealer Spike's search engine marketing techniques narrow down online users to people actively looking for the types of units sold at the dealership. This eliminates the possibility of wasted time and money spent marketing to people who are not in the market. Resources are invested in the customers who are most likely to purchase, allowing dealership owners to feel confident maximizing their budget. \n\nBruce Young, owner of B Young RV in the Portland, Oregon area, recently increased his dealership's ad spend. He made this decision after his monthly call with the Dealer Spike SEM team to go over his strategies and results. "It's a good value, and you can see it," Young explains. "The Internet is becoming more and more important to shoppers." \n\nYoung worked with another advertising agency, ReachLocal, before switching to Dealer Spike's services. "I prefer Dealer Spike," Young says. "If I can conceptualize an idea for my search engine marketing, the team at Dealer Spike can come up with ways to implement it. In the following months as we see results, they adjust our strategy. The team's responsiveness is really exceptional." Young says that one way he can see his SEM investment paying off for his dealership is through a high click-through rate from online ads to his dealership's website. Data and analytics information that the team shares with him also shows that these visitors stay on the page for a relatively long amount of time. \n\nDealer Spike's SEM services are able to offer higher lifetime value. Targeted ads allow dealerships to find customers who will keep coming back. Enabled re-targeting reminds customers of their purchase, or the purchase they are considering, with ads that follow them to other websites within the Google Display Network, as well as major search engines Bing and Yahoo! Dealerships are able to catch customers when they are most engaged - looking at websites similar to theirs. \n\nAngela Annamalai, owner of Shelby's Powersports in Bronx, New York, sees firsthand why SEM services are so valuable to her business. "Even though we are very much New York City, someone on Fifth Avenue may not consider coming here," Annamalai says. "I had a ten year-old from Manhattan Google us, then convince his mother to come out here. The only reason that happened is because our dealership showed up high in the search results."  Annamalai says she has similar experiences when she receives international calls from places like Dubai, with people interested in coming to look at her units when they are visiting the city. Online advertising opens up opportunities for her dealership that would not have been possible before. \n\nLike Young, Annamalai has also increased her ad spend with Dealer Spike. She made the decision to completely stop advertising her dealership on cable TV due to the amount of results she sees. "More traffic comes from our online ads than print advertising, direct mail, or any other marketing technique that we've tried," she says. While other SEM providers have contacted Shelby's Powersports, Annamalai is committed to Dealer Spike due to the impressive percentage of online visibility the team is able to offer. "They really know what they're doing," she says. "Dealer Spike has a high level of expertise. I'm willing to make the investment." \n\nClick, Call, or Come - these are the results dealerships can expect to see through Dealer Spike's SEM services. The most valuable online users and locations are targeted to drive traffic to Dealer Spike customers' online stores. Dealership owners watch as future customers click to submit a form, call the dealership, or come into the dealership location when faced with search engine marketing ads placed by Dealer Spike. \nContact: Press@DealerSpike.com \n800.288.5917 x410 \nwww.DealerSpike.com

0889_58be5215-c0b6-4254-8019-12d055551f0e	CBS has made a killing on cops and criminals over the years, but on Wednesday, the network will once again try to tap into another of TV's most reliable formats: the medical procedural. Code Black takes viewers inside the E.R. at Angel's Memorial Hospital, one of the busiest emergency departments in Los Angeles or perhaps the entire country. Inspired by a documentary of the same name about L.A. County-USC Medical Center's E.R., the drama is built around the moment when there are more patients on the floor than can be treated by the physicians on staff. That moment is the titular code black that the doctors will inevitably fail to avoid but heroically charge ahead. "We looked at it as it creates a situation where there's a level of heroism that's demanded on the part of the staff that we really don't see in any other aspect of society except for the military," executive producer Michael Seitzman says. "That, to me, was a great canvas for storytelling." Fall Preview: Check out all the must-see new shows Our heroes are led by Dr. Leanne Rorish ( Marcia Gay Harden ), the residency director who, of course, has endured a personal tragedy and, as a result, is willing to perform high-risk procedures to save lives, no matter who objects. Leading the objection most often is Dr. Neal Hudson ( Raza Jeffrey ), a standout physician in his own right, but one who disapproves of Leanne's "cowboy" approach to medicine. ("You're the doctor they want, "Leanne tells Neal in the pilot. "I'm the doctor they need.") Together with Jesse Sallander ( Luis Guzman ), a seen-it-all-before nurse who instructs the residents to refer to him as "Mama," Leanne and Neal are charged with guiding four first-year residents as they are thrown into the deep end on their first day. Christa ( Bonnie Somerville ) is a mother and wife who is judged for coming to medicine at an "old" age by Mario ( Benjamin Hollingsworth ), a former drug addict who has cleaned up his life and wants to give back. Angus ( Harry M. Ford ) is a doc who has the smarts to succeed, but he lacks self-confidence after living in the shadow of his older brother, who also came through the Angel's program. But he is inspired by Malaya ( Melanie Kannokada ), the only first-year resident who has already done time at Angel's and is therefore treated more harshly by Leanne. Page 2 of 3 - Despite TV's long history of medical shows, few have found success in the post- Grey's Anatomy era. But rather than focusing on the love lives of its doctors and their shenanigans in the on-call room, Code Black seems to taking its cues from the frenetically paced ER . Even so, Seitzman believes his show is unique. Code Black's Marcia Gay Harden and other familiar faces in new places "We wanted to make a world that was not like any other medical show," he says. "It's not glossy. It's not it doesn't feel Hollywood. The world feels very handmade, made by people to serve people. That was the key to how to tell the story: to light it naturally, to not worry if somebody falls into darkness, to create a code black and then put three cameras in the middle of it and shoot it. What we end up with is something that feels incredibly authentic ... and doesn't really doesn't feel like anything that I've ever seen before. ... By the end of an hour of watching it, you should feel like you've had a real experience, the way that doctors... will tell you you're a different person at the end of the shift than you were at the beginning. That's really our ambition." But is Code Black really the next ER ? Sure, there is a chaotic energy infused into the show thanks to quick cuts, constant chatter and an endless barrage of gurneys bursting through doors feet first. And when Leanne is busy drilling a hole in a teenager's head while talking one of her residents through an emergency C-section over a cell phone, there is a sort of riveting tension. But at this late date, none of it feels particularly original. Even so, the actors believe these are stories that need to be told. "You think, 'Oh, many of those stories have been done,'" Jaffrey says. "Then, during the course of this process, we got to talk to more and more doctors. ... You realize how many extraordinary stories that almost seem too incredible to put on screen happen every single day. And as long as those stories are told with the kind of integrity and with the passion that you see before us ... there's room for many, many more." Fall TV: Get scoop on your favorite returning shows Whether audiences will want to see this particular brand of storytelling remains to be seen, but those willing to give it a shot will get some good performances, most notably from Oscar winner Harden. (Guzman is also likable enough when he's not being saddled with exposition.) And the show will make you feel something as well. The pilot is chock-full of heartstring-tugging moments, which, as clichéd as they may seem at first glance, are still emotionally affecting. (In other words, keep the tissues handy.) Page 3 of 3 - "You can't beat the story engine," Seitzman says. "These people who come in at their worst and have to be greeted by people who are at their very best. Each one of them comes with their own perspective and their own particular way of doing things, their own problems, their own backstory. How do you explore all that in the face of this rolling catastrophe? "I think a lot of medical shows have a tendency to want to be the future of medicine," he continues. "What ends up often happening is it... kept me at arm's length. I wanted to be right up inside the story. To me, the most compelling thing about this world was the human element, the heroism of people. ... There's basic kindness in this environment that we don't see every day and sometimes we forget about. There are people out there, for very little money, comparatively, who go in there for these long shifts. And they're the ones who are there when someone comes in that door." Code Black premieres Wednesday at 10/9c on CBS. Will you watch? (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.) Other Links From TVGuide.com
0890_e5e0d63a-4e4b-47f1-ae21-dd3fae319eac	President Obama has launched a scaled-back college evaluation website that does not include what some in the higher-ed world had feared -- a government rating system of America’s roughly 7,000 colleges and universities. \n \nBut the site still has Washington asking questions about why the Department of Education is doing it in the first place. \n \nAmong the concerns is why spend taxpayer dollars when such for-profit operations as Barron's, The Princeton Review and U.S. \n   News & World Report have for years been providing similar information and rankings. \n“It’s definitely a government overreach, though less than they had talked about,” Neal McCluskey, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, told FoxNews.com on Monday. “The federal government shouldn’t be involved in assessing whether a college is good or bad.” \n \nHe also said underlying problems included little context about such factors as student bodies and suggested the federal government felt compelled to make the assessments given the roughly $150 billion it gives out annually in grants and loans.
0891_8d1d974f-a176-403a-91f5-b855c632bf47	In her first debate against Democrat Barbara Boxer in California’s Senate race five years ago, Carly Fiorina waited all of one minute to broadside the incumbent Democrat in her opening remarks. \n\nBoxer was indifferent to Californians, Fiorina said, and her record was “devastating for this state.” \n\nAt the time, Fiorina and Boxer were nearly tied in public opinion polls. Fiorina was performing so well that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it planned to invest in the race, and Jon Fleischman, the conservative blogger and former state Republican Party executive director, said Boxer finally had “a real opponent.” \n\nThen Fiorina flickered out. Two months later, she lost to Boxer by more than 10 percentage points. \n\nIn her return to politics – culminating in a breakout performance in Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate – it is unclear if Fiorina is enjoying only a moment, or something more lasting. Republicans in 2012 cycled through a league of up-and-down candidates before ultimately settling on Mitt Romney. \n\n“Things change pretty quickly, especially in our primary process,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. “What’s up today might be down tomorrow.” \n\nAsked about the long-term prospects of candidates who are surging now, he said, “I have no idea.” \n\n“What’s up today might be down tomorrow.” \n\nReince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee \n\nBuoyed by her success in an “undercard” debate last month, Fiorina on Wednesday kept up her criticism of Hillary Clinton and challenged Donald Trump, the front-running real estate developer and TV personality. She invoked the 2009 death of her stepdaughter to call for more investment in drug treatment, saying, “My husband, Frank, and I buried a child to drug addiction.” And she assailed Planned Parenthood over videos showing organization officials discussing the procurement of fetal tissue for research. \n\n“I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes,” she said. “Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.” \n\nCritics said the videos contained no such image, and Planned Parenthood accused Fiorina of lying. \n\nBut the debate was widely viewed as a success for Fiorina. While many of her opponents and their surrogates streamed into the post-debate “spin room” on Wednesday night to recast their performances, Fiorina demurred. Her on-stage effort stood for several hours on its own. \n\nThe next morning, the former Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive told ABC News, “I was very satisfied.” \n\nDespite her prominent showing in early debates, Fiorina’s political network remains narrower than candidates who have spent years raising money for lower offices, and her fundraising lags behind. Fiorina reported raising just $1.7 million in the second quarter of this year. \n\nDuring Wednesday’s debate, her campaign took to Twitter, asking followers to “pitch in $3” for the campaign. And the candidate herself appeared to acknowledge the field she has yet to overcome. When the candidates were asked what Secret Service code name they wanted if elected president, Fiorina said “Secretariat,” the horse that overcame slow starts on his way to winning the Triple Crown. \n\nIn her 2010 Senate campaign, Fiorina faced not only Boxer, but a Republican primary challenge from former Rep. Tom Campbell and then-Assemblyman Chuck DeVore. \n\nMarty Wilson, who managed Fiorina’s Senate campaign, said the primary was “no walk in the park.” Campbell, he said, was “a very good candidate, very articulate, obviously well schooled on the issues.” DeVore was more of a “classic conservative firebrand.” \n\nIn a debate that year, Fiorina dealt a blow to Campbell when he said people on the federal government’s no-fly watch list should not be able to buy a gun. \n\n“That’s why Tom Campbell has kind of a poor rating from the National Rifle Association, right there,” Fiorina said. \n\n“Carly had to first prove that she could hold her own with those guys, and she did, and came out of those debates on top, and then had to go debate Barbara Boxer,” Wilson said. “Carly’s pretty practiced in terms of debate performance.” \n\nThough she ultimately lost, her defeat came in a heavily Democratic state – not the Republican primary electorate she is seeking to attract now. \n\nAsked to respond to Trump’s remarks in Rolling Stone magazine about her appearance – “Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?” – Fiorina said, “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.” \n\nHer response impressed even one prominent Democrat. Maria Shriver said on Twitter that Fiorina “handled response to #Trump comments about her face really well.” \n\n“I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.” \n\nCarly Fiorina \n\nFiorina is not above personal comments – she called Boxer’s hair “so yesterday” in 2010 – or sarcasm. On Wednesday, she characterized Trump as a “wonderful entertainer” and declined to say if she would feel comfortable with him holding the country’s nuclear codes. \n\nTo Scott Wilk, a Republican assemblyman from Santa Clarita, Fiorina appeared sharper than in 2010, offering “a lot of specificity” and “great rhetoric.” \n\n“I think having gone through that experience in the Boxer campaign has … honed her skills and, I mean, she rocks it out there,” he said. “She’s definitely top tier now.” \n\nIn this year’s unusually large field of candidates, Fiorina, Trump and Ben Carson – all of whom come from outside politics – together hold more support than the candidates who have held elected office. On Wednesday, Fiorina said “this nation’s possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it.” \n\nWithout achievements in elected office, Fiorina is promoting her record at HP, which became a liability for her in 2010, when Boxer criticized her relentlessly for laying off 30,000 employees and outsourcing jobs. \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said HP “is a disaster and continues to be a disaster,” provoking Fiorina to criticize the real estate developer for bankruptcies at his casinos while running up “mountains of debt using other people’s money.” \n\nAmid a lengthy exchange, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie interjected – assuming the role of a scold. \n\n“While I’m as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly’s career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn’t have a job, who can’t fund his child’s education, I’ve got to tell you the truth,” he said. “They could care less about your careers. They care about theirs.” \n\n“Now that she’s done really well at this level, you’re going to see some criticisms of her.” \n\nBeth Miller, California GOP strategist who worked on Fiorina’s Senate campaign \n\nFollowing the debate, former California Republican Party Chairman Ron Nehring, who is chairing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign in California, faulted Fiorina for engaging with Trump. \n\n“It’s not smart to get into this back-and-forth on the debate stage, like this is some type of game show,” he said. “And I think it diminishes a candidate to get into that.” \n\nBut for Fleischman, who considered Fiorina a “real opponent” for Boxer in 2010, the debate was evidence that Fiorina has only “stepped up her game.” \n\n“You almost wish the Fiorina of today was the one running back then,” he said. \n\nBeth Miller, a Republican strategist who served as an adviser to Fiorina in 2010, said Fiorina’s gender – she is the only woman in a sea of men – puts her in a “unique position to talk about Hillary Clinton,” while her experience in business affords her a “unique position to go after Donald Trump.” \n\nShe said a good debate can rally interest in a candidate, opening some donors’ wallets. But there is a flip side of gaining momentum in a campaign. \n\n“Now that she’s done really well at this level,” Miller said, “you’re going to see some criticisms of her.”

Evidently a feasibility study of traffic, parking and schools does not have to be done when zoning is done to give tax exemption to developers. Parking on the street is currently a problem, and the parking issue is not addressed in the plan. Also, traffic issues on Willamette are not addressed in the plan or previous changes except for capturing bike lanes. The plan allows developers to increase the height of buildings if more green space is allowed. Is this like green space around Capstone Apartments? \n \nGreen space and wildlife can be seen while walking in our neighborhoods, and these buildings will impact that experience. The new Cascade Manor buildings are close to the sidewalk and cast a big shadow on the streets. The current Cascade Manor also gives a negative sample of how taller buildings impact our neighborhood experience; however, there is a green space from the surrounding single family dwellings that may go away with the plan. \n \nWe have some beautiful trees that are struggling in our area, and I am afraid this will also change; we will be seeing these trees disappear as the plan is implemented. \n \nAnn Miller, Eugene \n \nDEVELOPER’S DELIGHT \n \nI oppose the South Willamette Special Area Zone in its current form. Contrary to Ken Standhardt’s suggestion [Letters, 9/3], my opposition to this plan is not out of ignorance. I have read every document and studied every map. The new design rezones 229 single-family homes to allow seven-story condos and apartments.  \n \nThere are many insular neighborhoods here. While some blocks could benefit, other historical neighborhoods will have their character and stability negatively altered. I bought my 1952 home on Portland Street north of 31st   Avenue a year ago. I did my research, too. \n \nI received no notice from the city. I was not aware of the plan until the record before the Planning Commission was closed. \n \nThis area is too diverse in character to take such a broad-brush approach. The area should be looked at block-by-block, lot-by-lot for change. While the city claims it wants to make the area more pedestrian and bike friendly, the design contains no requirements for traffic, sidewalks, bike lanes, parking or underground utilities. I’m sure it is a developer’s delight. City documents show that it is already planning to extend MUPTE to developers of the area. \n \nAllison Hassler, Eugene \n \nDOWNWINDERS SUFFER \n \nOn a recent Saturday, I went to a birthday at Emerald Park. I smelled cigarette smoke and saw numerous parents smoking in the playground area, including vapor cigarettes. They want to watch their kids and make sure they’re safe, just like I do. They’re not worried about the smoke. That’s up to them. I don’t think it is OK for my kids. \n \nWe had our party on picnic benches by the skate park. Our kids rolled their decorated scooters around the skate park while boys on bicycles smoked vapor cigarettes inside the fence. Someone else smoked a cigarette outside the fence. At Monroe Park, close to home, people talk at the picnic benches and smoke. The smoke travels downwind into the playground area. \n \nThe problem isn’t homeless smokers. The problem is smoke in public space. When I inhale cigarette smoke, my private space, my body, is being infringed upon, and so are the bodies of my children. \n \nI used to smoke. I know it is a hassle to be told you can’t satisfy your addiction when you want. Unfortunately, we share a responsibility toward our mutual wellbeing. And some of us — many of us — have our strongest feelings around the health of our children. \n \nA smoking ban isn’t a class issue. It is possible to be homeless and be a nonsmoker. The health of someone homeless counts too along with the health of my children. Everyone, even smokers, suffer from secondhand smoke. \n \nOtis Haschemeyer, Eugene \n \nVINIS A GREAT CHOICE \n \nLucy Vinis is a compelling choice for the next mayor of Eugene. With deep roots in this community, she cares about the things that are most important to me and my family: protecting our quality of life while promoting a healthy, vibrant economy. \n \nI’ve known Lucy as both a colleague and friend. A warm and open individual, she is a natural leader — articulate, thoughtful, principled and inclusive. During her many years of service to this community, she gained firsthand experience with some of our most pressing issues: homelessness, jobs, education, sustainability. She plans to build on the progress we’ve made in these areas over the past decade, earning Eugene its bragging rights as one of the most livable cities in the country. I hope you’ll join me in supporting her. \n \n  Sonja Snyder, Eugene \n \nMILD FRAGRANCES \n \nMy family was disappointed to learn that the Saturday Market Board of Directors has voted to suspend Barbara’s Soaps of the Season, due to a complaint about scent-sensitivity from one of the other stall owners [see Biz Beat last week]. I understand that some people are sensitive to fragrances, but we find it difficult to believe that this business is affronting anyone’s olfaction. My husband is the most fragrant-sensitive person I know. He can’t tolerate perfume and has to leave areas where people are wearing strong scents. Yet he isn’t able to detect Barbara’s Soaps until he is in their stall, and even then, the scents are mild.  \n \nBarbara and her husband, David, make amazing products, and we use the soaps as well as the deodorant. Because we frequently give the soaps as gifts, or run out of them as our own supply runs low, we are often at Saturday Market. If this stall isn’t there, it’s doubtful we’ll go more than once or twice a year. I imagine there are many who feel as we do. We hope the board will reconsider suspending Barbara’s Soaps of the Season, and instead do whatever is needed to move the affected parties’ stalls apart so that everyone can continue to enjoy Saturday Market.  \n \nDuana C. Welch, Eugene \n \nSOAP OPERA \n \nI want to thank you for your short article in Biz Beat Sept. 3 on the troubles at Saturday Market. I am a fan of the market and especially of Barbara’s Soaps, which I think are wonderful. I question the fairness of ejecting her from the market — she seems to be the only vendor targeted by the new scent-free policy. It bears mentioning that one of the board members who voted on this issue is a soap maker who has been heard to complain about Barbara’s products cutting into her sales. I have always thought the atmosphere of the market was one of tolerance and acceptance. Surely there is a less extreme solution to this problem. \n \nMeanwhile, I will follow Barbara wherever she sells her soaps, shampoos and lotions — I wouldn’t use anything else! \n \nTeresa McFarland, Eugene \n \nWORKER POWER \n \nJim Hightower’s Sept. 3 essay “Democratic Audacity” presents some important points regarding the origins of Labor Day. However, it failed to mention what I consider to be the most important aspect of those origins. Before there ever was an American Labor Day, there was a far more radical labor day, May Day (May 1). This was, and to some extent still is, Europe’s genuine celebration of working people. In the spirit of social amnesia that characterizes so much in the U.S., America’s Labor Day is a depoliticization of International Workers’ Day , chosen by the Socialists and Communists of the Second International to commemorate the Haymarket affair in Chicago (May 1886).  \n \nThere were other times — and other countries — in which politicians actually cared about (and feared) what working people thought and did. Much of the social safety net now enjoyed by German workers was enacted in the late 19th century by Otto von Bismarck (otherwise not exactly a “progressive”). The reason: to take the wind out of the sails of socialism, at the time the most vibrant social movement in Europe.  \n \nWhat will it take for America’s elites to care about what working people think and do? \n \nStephen Slater, Eugene \n \nDENYING REALITY \n \nWhat is cognitive dissonance? It happens when new information doesn’t jibe with existing beliefs, ideas or values. It causes mental distress. For example, the fact that Oregon’s snowpack this past year was only 11 percent of the average of what we’ve seen in the past 121 years doesn’t fit with how I want to proceed with planning for this upcoming ski season. Yet the past is often the best predictor of the future. So how do I resolve this disconnect? I deny climate change is happening. That way, I can go ahead and buy my new ski equipment and rev up my SUV. \n \nThe Oregon Center for Public Policy recently published some data that ought to produce some cognitive dissonance. In 2014, a minimum wage worker in Oregon working 40 hours a week earned $18,928. The problem is, the income needed for a single adult to achieve a basic level of economic security, in Eugene, is $26,958. (This does not include saving for retirement, college or a rainy day fund.) \n \nLet’s not react with denial. Let’s support increasing our minimum wage to $15 per hour. When we know our bills can be paid, we all sleep better. \n \nJennifer Gordon, Eugene \n \nSINGLE TINGLE \n \nThankin’ Rankin for contribution to conversations on loneliness [cover story by Kelsey Anne Rankin, 8/27]. \n \nI myself finally understood that a person more fascinating than myself simply doesn’t exist. (Except in an abstract, ephemeral sort of way.) Dependence on others is a cruel burden ... especially dependence on stuff like groceries, shoes and, sure, sex. Those others are all even more driven by grandiose fantasies of boundless success or power or perfect love than me. \n \nOnly solution I’ve discovered is make your own clothes, produce your own food (chewed and swallowed by your very own digestive apparatuses), create your own entertainment and march along to your unique copyrighted beat. I don’t claim to have achieved this exalted ideal but, man, it sure makes for a real local low-energy lifestyle. \n \nBreak it to them gently. Let the others know you don’t need them any more. Make rare great art for no one but yourself. \n \nDavid Hugh Tyson, Eugene \n \nHUGE STINK \n \nDearest Eugenean dog owners, I love how you love your pups, and I wish that I could own one right now. But can you please mind your poop? Thank you to all who bring poop bags on their walks, but when you throw them in residential garbage cans, it creates a huge stink, and they sometimes fall out on garbage collection day to get run over by cars or picked up on the road by yours truly. Thank you for being mindful citizens of such a wonderful town. Let’s keep it up! \n \nMarylin Magnus, Eugene \n \nLIGHTEN UP \n \n“Appalling”? Well shut my mouth, but wait until I get my tongue out of my cheek. In reference to Margaret Hadaway’s response in the Sept. 3 letters to my earlier letter about a front page picture about care of books, all I can ask is “please lighten up.” \n \nIt was only my attempt at laughing about the preaching at Eugene Weekly cover art. The world needs to remember that you cannot communicate from a soap box. Opinions are not facts. \n \nKenner McAlister \n \nCottage Grove \n \nCLEANER BUSES \n \nThe other day I learned that LTD is considering the purchase of zero-emission, electric buses. I’m glad to see this shift towards cleaner forms of transportation. I hope that this continues, as it is better for the air that we all breathe and more economically cost effective in the long run. \n \nCharles V. Perricone, Eugene \n \nBETTER INVESTMENT \n \nTo the Egyptian billionaire who’s offered to donate an Italian/Greek island to the escaping refugees of the turbulence in their African and Mideastern home countries: It might be wiser to invest your resources in seaworthy vessels and honest, conscientious, well-trained navigators and thus eliminate the unscrupulous smugglers who separate individuals from their dignity, their life savings and in many cases, their lives! \n \nJim Graham, Eugene

0894_0d572ba6-1103-48a4-8ec6-095a82cf97c1	Research Analysts’ updated eps estimates for Monday, September 21st: \n \nAAC Holdings (NYSE:AAC) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at William Blair. The analysts wrote, “Universal Health Services Acquires Foundations Recovery Network; Demonstrates Continued Interest in the Substance Abuse Space On Friday, September 18, 2015, Universal Health Services (UHS $137.93) announced its intention to acquire Foundations Recovery Network (Foundations) in a deal valued at roughly $350 million. This follows the late-2014 purchase of CRC Health by Acadia Healthcare (ACHC $75.84) and highlights the continued interest in the substance abuse treatment space by the industry’s largest behavioral healthcare providers (which we believe shows the positive macro trends in the industry). Foundations was founded by American Addiction Centers (AAC) CEO Michael Cartwright, and we therefore believe the organization provides similar services, targets a somewhat similar customer base (via direct-to-consumer marketing platforms and a national sales team), and has a relatively similar sales mix as AAC.”” \n \nAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) had its hold rating reissued by analysts at S&P Equity Research. S&P Equity Research currently has a $82.00 target price on the stock. \n \nNational Securities initiated coverage on shares of StoneCastle Financial Corp (NASDAQ:BANX) . The firm issued a neutral rating and a $19.00 target price on the stock. The analysts wrote, “We are initiating coverage of StoneCastle Financial Corporation (BANX) with a NEUTRAL rating and $19 price target.  BANX is unique for a number of reasons, the first being it is not a BDC per se but a registered investment company (RIC) which puts its asset coverage requirement at 300% as opposed to 200% for BDCs.  Also, StoneCastle invests primarily in investment grade companies (75% rated investment grade as of 2Q15) as opposed to BDCs which investment primarily in below investment grade companies.  The non-BDC status permits BANX to maintain its industry concentration of community and regional banks.  We believe that community banks are an attractive investment as regulation continues to drive M&A in the sector, banks continue to require capital, and StoneCastle’s deal flow pertaining to this sector remains robust.  The company has had no losses or impairments of assets since its inception.  StoneCastle is also seeking to invest in a pooled bank transaction which would be funded with non-recourse financing and permit higher leverage than what would otherwise be in the RIC structure itself.  We believe BANX is in a position to continue to improve effective yields and NIM (net investment margin).  We also think that BANX will continue to see sizable deal flow and should be relatively immune from the slowdown in traditional middle market originations.   Our $19 price target implies an estimated 2016 Price/Net Investment Income (P/ NII) of 10.7x, dividend yield of 6.9%, and Price/Net Asset Value (P/NAV) of 0.83x.  BANX does not really have a publicly traded comp set.  Although there are certainly other non-BDC RICs, there are none to our knowledge that invest exclusively in community banks.” \n \nSky Plc (LON:BSY) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \n \nConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a buy rating. The firm currently has $47.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, “In fiscal 2016, ConAgra aims to improve its profitability with the help of three major strategic initiatives; reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses; expansion of Lamb Weston as well as Consumer Foods business through capital investments and portfolio improvements; and balanced capital allocation. The company believes that its acquisition of Blake's All Natural Foods would serve to improve top-line results in the upcoming quarters by tapping the growing demand for frozen foods. Moreover, backed by lucrative dividend and share repurchase programs, ConAgra aims to augment the value of its shareholders. However, appreciation of the U.S. dollar, extensive industry rivalry as well as volatility in input supply might pose challenges before the company, going forward.” \n \nCommerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Commerce Bancshares’ second-quarter 2015 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Improvement in revenues and a reduction in provisions were partly offset by elevated costs. We believe that a robust capital base and sturdy liquidity level makes the company well positioned to capitalize on its penchant for inorganic growth. Also, the company’s initiatives in the mortgage banking area are expected to pay off in the form of enhanced fee generation going forward. Further, the company’s steady capital deployment activities continue to boost shareholders’ value. However, we remain apprehensive regarding the impact of weak expense management, stringent regulations and prevailing low interest rate environment on profitability in the near-term.” \n \nCarnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) had its market perform rating reissued by analysts at William Blair. \n \nCidara Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CDTX) had its outperform rating reaffirmed by analysts at Wedbush. They currently have a $22.00 target price on the stock. \n \nColgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Colgate-Palmolive commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. We believe that Colgate-Palmolive’s continued focus on product innovation along with globally recognized brands and presence in both developed and emerging economies enables it to capture growth opportunities and boost profitability. Also, its capital allocation strategy enables it to constantly reward shareholders. However, the company reported dismal second-quarter 2015 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines declined year over year and lagged estimates due to the impact of adverse foreign currency fluctuations. Also, estimates moved lower as the company expects these currency headwinds and macroeconomic woes to linger in 2015 and in turn, hurt results.” \n \nDeckers Outdoor Corp (NASDAQ:DECK) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a buy rating. They currently have $68.00 target price on the stock. According to Zacks, “Deckers posted narrower-than-expected loss of $1.43 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. However, the loss widened from the year-ago period. On the other hand, net sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but rose 1.1% year over year on the back of strong performance of its Teva and HOKA ONE ONE brands, offset by softness witnessed across the UGG and Sanuk brands. Sales trends remained sturdy across the Direct-to-Consumer division, while Omni-Channel initiatives boosted consumer experience. Management now projects top- and bottom-line growth of 8% and 10.5%, respectively, for fiscal 2016.” \n \nDaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE:DVA) had its outperform rating reaffirmed by analysts at William Blair. \n \nDexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at William Blair. \n \nEMC (NYSE:EMC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “EMC Corp. reported mixed second quarter results with earnings surpassing the Zacks Concensus Estimate while revenue missed the same. We believe the modest performance was due to significant competition in storage, cloud computing and Big Data markets, which, along with the sluggish IT spending and pricing pressure, will continue to pressure the stock. Nevertheless, the company’s long-term growth remain supported by customer wins, strong backlog, high-end product launches and VMware. EMC’s strategic acquisitions, partnerships and product breadth focusing on the third generation IT platform (Big Data, predictive analytics and mobile computing) will help enterprises move to the cloud, thus driving its top line.” \n \nRandgold Resources (NASDAQ:GOLD) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \n \nHuron Consulting Group (NASDAQ:HURN) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at William Blair. The analysts wrote, “Commentary About Large Project Creates Short-Term Headwind, but Still Like Stock for 2016 What Happened? Shares of Huron Consulting have traded down 7%-8% over the last three days following a presentation by management at a competitor’s conference.”” \n \nICICI Bank (NYSE:IBN) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “ICICI Bank’s first-quarter fiscal 2016 (ended Jun 30) results primarily benefited from growth in revenues, partially offset by elevated operating expenses and higher loan loss provisions. We believe the company’s increased dependence on domestic loans, focus on improving fee income, a stable fund base and market leadership in the insurance business will keep enhancing growth. However, a highly competitive operating environment, mounting expenses, persistent deterioration in credit quality and stringent regulatory requirements will continue to dampen the company’s performance.” \n \nInfineon Technologies AG (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Infineon’s third-quarter fiscal 2015 results showed improvement both in term of revenues and earnings driven by strong seasonality in demand pattern. The company witnessed robust performance across all segments, coupled with considerable benefits from the International Rectifier acquisition, which drove earnings in the quarter. However, cyclical nature of the semi-conductor industry and prolonged time-cycle test for products will likely act as headwinds. Moreover, the company operates in a highly competitive environment. As a result, it might be forced to reduce prices or increase spending, both of which will impact sales and profits adversely. Also, frequent introduction of products and difficulty in integration of acquired companies may weigh on Infineon’s near-term results.” \n \nJohnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) had its strong-buy rating reaffirmed by analysts at S&P Equity Research. S&P Equity Research currently has a $64.00 target price on the stock. \n \nJohn Wiley & Sons (NASDAQ:JW.A) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “John Wiley & Sons reported first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of $0.58 per share that outdid expectations, while revenues of $423 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $429 million. However, on a constant currency basis, both metrics were up year over year driven by growth in Online Program Management, Online Test Preparation, Custom Material, and Author-Funded Access.  Given the gradual decline of print media, the company is transforming its business into a more digital services oriented one. Revenue from Print books declined 9% in quarter and market for the same is expected to remain under pressure. Moreover, due to its global operations, the company’s revenues are vulnerable to currency fluctuations.” \n \nMeredith (NYSE:MDP) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Favorable advertising trends in the digital section and recent acquisitions continue to favorably impact Meredith’s performance. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein earnings of $0.94 per share grew 6.8% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the seventh straight quarter. Though revenues of $426 million came almost in line with the estimate, it grew 9% year over year. Waning print media trends and stiff competition continue to be immediate concerns. Nevertheless, Meredith is focused on bolstering advertising revenues, primarily in the digital space, and is increasingly concentrating on brand licensing, marketing services and e-Commerce. Recently, Media General has announced its decision to acquire Meredith.” \n \nMicrosemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Microsemi Corporation is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. Fiscal third-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Also, forward revenue guidance was encouraging. Microsemi’s compelling products, scope for margin expansion and decent balance sheet are other positives. However, pockets of weakness related to the high-margin satellite business, product transition at medical customers, push-out of some communications spending in China and a softer oil & gas market will impact revenues. Also, heavy investment in R&D could impact near-term profitability.” \n \nMGIC Investment Corp. (NYSE:MTG) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “MGIC Investment’s improving housing market, outstanding credit quality and new business will continue to spur growth in 2015. In 2015, the annual persistency is expected between 80% and 85%. However, lower annual premiums by the Federal Housing Administration, stricter capital regulations and persistently low interest rates are the headwinds.  Nonetheless, the company expects to comply with the revised PMIERs, which are likely to be effective by year-end 2015. With respect to earnings results, the company’s second-quarter net income per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and more than doubled year over year on a rise in new insurance written and lower loss. Increase in premiums and decrease in new delinquent notices, paid claims and a delinquent inventory resulted in the upside.” \n \nNike (NYSE:NKE) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Nike posted splendid fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings and sales results along with enhanced margins. This encouraged management to issue a positive outlook for fiscal 2016, as it expects the strong momentum to continue. We remain impressed with Nike’s robust growth and product innovation that have helped it deliver positive earnings surprises for 12 straight quarters now. Further, the company aims to increase its global reach and market share by expanding its operations in the emerging markets while focusing on digital development, direct-to-consumer business and other brands. However, unfavorable currency fluctuations remain a matter of concern. Also, the company remains prone to the soft economic environment and risks of operating in overseas markets.” \n \nOrmonde Mining PLC (LON:ORM) was downgraded by analysts at TheStreet to a hold rating. \n \nPROSIEBENSAT.1 MEDIA (OTCMKTS:PBSFF) had its buy rating reiterated by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \n \nPetra Diamonds (NASDAQ:PDMDF) had its hold rating reiterated by analysts at Beaufort Securities. \n \nPetmed Express (NASDAQ:PETS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “PetMed exhibited a mixed performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. Incidentally, reorder sales growth in the quarter failed to fully offset the decline in new order sales. Meanwhile, increased product cost weighed on gross margin. However, we are encouraged that after a series of disappointing quarterly operating margin numbers, the company has been witnessing a turnaround in this regard in the last three quarters. This is mainly owing to the company’s ongoing cost reduction initiatives. On the flip side, however, lesser advertising raises concerns. The company is currently trying to implement several strategies to revive its top line including focus on advertising efficiency to improve new order sales.” \n \nPier 1 Imports (NYSE:PIR) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Wedbush. The firm currently has a $9.50 price target on the stock. \n \nPool (NASDAQ:POOL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Pool Corp. has been negatively affected by seasonality, especially in the last reported quarter. Heavy rainfall and severe floods in Texas hurt demand in the region. Cooler weather in the Midwest and Northeast also delayed pool openings. Also, new pool construction remains well below the pre-recession levels, which is a concern. Further, currency headwinds weighed on international sales. However, the company’s base business sales growth, along with favorable trends in the housing market should make up for the headwinds to some extent. The continued strong growth in the pool renovation category along with reasonable sales growth in the green segment (the Horizon segment) is another positive.” \n \nProvidence & Worcester Railroad Company (NYSE:PWX) had its buy rating reaffirmed by analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm currently has a $87.00 price target on the stock. \n \nRestaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) had its sector outperform rating reissued by analysts at Scotiabank. The firm currently has a $50.00 price target on the stock. \n \nBankrate (NYSE:RATE) had its outperform rating reaffirmed by analysts at RBC Capital. They currently have a $15.00 price target on the stock. \n \nRelx PLC (NASDAQ:RELX) had its buy rating reaffirmed by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \n \nRTL Group (EBR:RTL) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \n \nSEI Investments Company (NASDAQ:SEIC) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “SEI Investments’ second-quarter 2015 earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Steady growth in revenues was offset by higher expenses. Further, the asset position continued to be robust. We believe that the company’s innovative and diverse global investment products and services will keep the earnings momentum alive going forward. Also, sturdy asset inflows will continue to support top-line growth. Though the company’s steady capital deployment activities remain impressive, we remain apprehensive regarding the impact of weak cost control, high dependence on fee-based revenues and a stringent regulatory landscape on profitability in the near term.” \n \nSky Plc (NASDAQ:SKYAY) had its neutral rating reiterated by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \n \nSymrise Ag (OTCMKTS:SYIEF) had its buy rating reissued by analysts at DZ Bank AG. \n \nTate & Lyle PLC (OTCMKTS:TATYY) had its neutral rating reiterated by analysts at Citigroup Inc.. \n \nVF Corp (NYSE:VFC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “V.F. Corporation reported impressive second-quarter 2015 results with both top and bottom lines faring better than expectations. Strong results were backed by solid performances at its business segments as well as lower tax rate. Also, the company raised its earnings outlook for 2015, anticipating a strong second half 2015. The company’s sustained focus on opportunistic acquisitions and expansion of global operations highlight its growth prospects. Moreover, its solid brand portfolio and opportunities with regard to distribution bode well. However, its significant global presence exposes it to currency headwinds. A prevalent soft macroeconomic environment, stiff competition and seasonality of business also remain challenges.”
0895_566ba1d5-390b-427e-9292-909e73a543ea	Believe Digital   \nKentucky county clerk Kim Davis stirred up enough religious noise that even Pope Francis had to sit down with her. \n\nReverend Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman, confirmed to that Davis, who defied a court order to issue marriage license to same-sex couples, met privately with the pontiff during his trip to Washington, D.C. last week.  \n\n"I don't deny the meeting has taken place. but I have no comment to add," Lombardi said. \n\nTheir meeting was rumored to have happened after Davis' account of the incident was by Dr.  Robert Moynihan , the editor and founder of Inside The Vatican. The piece was later publicized on the Liberty Council's .   Davis told Moynihan that the pair had seen each other in private in the afternoon of Sept. 24—the same day the pope to Congress. \n\nThe next day, Davis was awarded the Cost of Discipleship award at the Family Research Council's Values Voter Summit in honor of her actions surrounding her initial incident—the original reason for her trip to the city, according to Moynihan. \n\nAfter Davis was brought to the Vatican Embassy along with her husband, Moynihan said the pope thanked her in English for her courage and presented her and her husband with a pair of blessed rosaries. \n\n"Stay strong," Moynihan claims he told Davis as he held out his hands and asked her to pray for him. According to the account, Davis obliged and asked for the same in return. \n YouTube   \nDavis's attorney, Mathew Staver, said in a  with USA Today that the meeting lasted around 15 minutes long. No photographs of the meeting have been released as of yet. \n\nDavis rose to notoriety following the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage over the summer. She continually failed to issue marriage licenses to gay couples "under God's authority," citing her Apostolic Christian faith and religious liberty as the reason behind her objections. She was later issued a court order which she continued to ignore until she was and released five days later. \n\nThe pope addressed the entire ordeal during a gaggle with reporters on the papal plane on the return flight to Rome, declaring that government workers may object to their duties if they have a "conscientious objection" to it because that is their "human right."
0896_e6530c2c-4a58-4076-93bd-71b64169dad1	Mike and Jennifer Wendland Podcasting from Florida's Emerald Coast \n  \n (PRWEB)  September 05, 2015  \n\nIn a little over 10 months, Roadtreking : The RV Podcast that features interviews, RV news, bucket list destination reports and tips and technology advice to enjoy the small motorhome lifestyle has just reached the coveted 1 million download mark. \n \nProduced weekly by award-winning journalist Mike Wendland and his wife, Jennifer, the show began in October 2014 as an hour-long podcast available from iTunes, Stitcher and various online apps and services, as well as the Roadtreking.com RV Travel blog. \n \n"Very, very few podcasts ever reach that 1 million downloads milestone," said Wendland. "And for those that do, it usually takes years. The fact that we hit that number in a little over 10 months shows just how much interest there is in RV travel and the small motorhome lifestyle." \n \nNot all of the listeners are RVers, Wendland notes. \n \n"We hear all the time from people who say they just want to listen to something that is positive and entertaining. People love hearing about the interesting people and places we visit, with no politics or bickering. People are too tired of bad news and they really seem to gravitate to contest that is essentially positive and entertaining." \n \nFor most of his professional career, Wendland was one of those hard-nosed investigative reporters, working for both major newspapers in Detroit, as well as the leading TV station. He also does a weekly tech report for all 215 NBC TV stations. He won numerous honors, including 18 EMMY awards for his reporting. \n \n"They used to call me bad news Wendland," he says. "That was all I reported. And it took a toll. I became a real cynic. When I left daily journalism, I bought an RV and we started to travel as a way to decompress. Along the way, we discovered that all was not gloom and doom and, in fact, not people were quite happy and content and paid no mind at all to the negativity that pours out of the mainstream media." \n \nSo to share the interesting stories he kept encountering out on the road, he started the blog in 2012. It now has 350,000 readers a month.  The podcast began last fall. \n \nEach hour-long episode of the podcast features listener questions, RV News of the Week, a segment on Traveling Technology , an RV Event Calendar and off-the-beaten-path bucket list reports on the favorite travel destinations of RVers. The Wendlands produce the show from wherever they happen to be each week as they travel North America in a 2015 Roadtrek CS Adventurous XL that is outfitted with solar power and high tech, high efficiency Lithium Ion batteries. \n \n"We can do the show from literally anywhere," he said. "We don't need shore power. Between solar and the lithium batteries, we are energy independent. So we've done the show from very remote places like mountaintops and the deep woods of national and state forests. Last week, we did the podcast right next to our Roadtrek, parked right on the beach of Florida's Emerald Coast." \n \nThe Wendlands also visit many RV shows. They are planning to visit the Hershey, PA show in two weeks and will do an episode of the podcast from there, as well as the National RV Show in Louisville, KY in December. \n \nOne of the reasons the podcast is successful, Wendland believes, is that RVers are on the road a lot. "Podcasts really help the miles go by," he said. "The entertainment systems on most newer RVs interface perfectly with smartphones and tablets and right from the podcasting apps, people can play the show as they travel. Podcasts and RVing are a perfect fit." \n  \nShare article on social media or email

0899_acedaa54-9820-4b71-aa7b-38dc7ed1d2a6	Dell Curry is many things "” the Charlotte Hornets"™ all-time leading scorer, the team"™s TV color analyst for the past six seasons and the father of NBA players Steph and Seth Curry. \n\nIn the past few months, Dell Curry has not only watched Steph win an NBA title with Golden State, but he has also become a grandfather again "” Steph and his wife, Ayesha, had another baby girl in July to join big sister Riley. And Dell Curry played a round of golf on Aug. 14 in a foursome that also included Steph, former NBA star Ray Allen and President Obama. \n\nCurry will return as a Hornets broadcaster again for his seventh season and said he is impressed that the Hornets have improved their perimeter shooting (which was always Curry"™s specialty in his playing days and is now the best part of his sons"™ games as well). I caught up with Curry this week by phone while he was in Utah on a hunting trip. \n\nQ: Is life any different for you now that Steph has won both an MVP and an NBA title? \n\nA: Well, a little. It"™s been a whirlwind summer, for sure. I"™m recognized  little more. \n\n \n \n\t \nAs my daughter said way back when Steph was at Davidson, he put me back on the map. After the Hornets"™ season ended, I was pretty much able to stay out in Oakland and go to all the playoff games and ride that wave with him and the family. \n\nQ: You will have two sons in the NBA this year, with Seth signing a two-year guaranteed deal to play for Sacramento. He had interest from several teams after starring in the D-league and the NBA"™s summer league, including Golden State. So why not go play beside his brother? \n\nA: I"™m really excited for Seth and proud of the way he has worked. He wants to create his own path in his own city, and I respect and understand that. Seth has an opportunity now. I know he can do it. He knows he can do it. But he still has to do it. \n\nQ: So how was playing golf with President Obama? \n\nA: That was one for the bucket list, for sure, to play golf with the most powerful man in the free world. Steph and I played against President Obama and Ray Allen. We lost on the 18th hole and lost a few bucks. The president is a good golfer. He plays from the left side and has a good short game. \n\nQ: You are a respected NBA analyst, and you are Steph"™s dad. If every NBA player was a free agent, you were a head coach and you got the No. 1 pick to start a new team, would you choose LeBron, Steph or someone else? \n\nA: Wow, that"™s a loaded one. All things considered, I"™m going Curry. \n\n"”"”"” \n\nÂ©2015 The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.) \n\nVisit The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.) at www.charlotteobserver.com \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\n_____ \n\nTopics: c000213164
0900_eacc9625-b22d-4a44-a62e-7d53c132af1a	It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction, Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code. "It'll simplify the tax code, it'll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn't seen for decades."\n\nThe highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks. Individuals that make less than $25,000 (and $50,000 for married couples) would pay no income taxes under Trump's plan.\n\nHowever, the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $150,001 and more and couples making $300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25%. That's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40%.\n\nThe tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone, lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more.\n\nAsked at Monday's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate, Trump dodged the question, saying: "We're reducing taxes, but believe me, there will be people in the very upper echelon that won't be thrilled with this."\n\nHe also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays, only saying, "I fight like hell to pay as little as possible."\n\nPerhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan's deep tax cuts, though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country's debt or deficit.\n\nThe candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways: killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas, thereby boosting growth at home.\n\nTrump's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals: Jeb Bush.\n\nBush's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven. The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor's plan is 28%, and the lowest is 10%. Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20% -- another popular idea among conservatives. Trump would go even further, lowering the rate to 15%.\n\nLike Bush, one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest, which is a share of profits paid to investment managers.\n\nSince launching his White House campaign in June, Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest.\n\nTrump, who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $10 billion, frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers, he often says, fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals.\n\n"I know them. They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton," Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. "They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck. They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes."\n\nStill, the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street. Since Trump's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board, taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code.\n\nThe tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates.\n\n"We will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains," Bush's tax proposal said.\n\nIt's also popular rallying cry for the Democratic candidates.\n\nFormer Secretary of Hillary Clinton has been hitting Wall Street tax breaks since the first days of her campaign, as she's faced pressure from progressive Democrats to embrace a more populist agenda. Antagonism towards Wall Street is a central message of Clinton's rivals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.

0904_eea50da5-c5ef-4e37-8d9b-db7942c1b7fd	Scotland manager Gordon Strachan felt his players were just short of the accuracy needed to break down a stubborn Georgia defence as his team fell to a 1-0 European Championship qualifying defeat. \n \nScotland started the better side in Tbilisi but struggled to carve clear chances and the hosts improved before Valeri Kazaishvili fired them in front in the 37th minute after no blue-shirted player could close him down quickly enough as he brought down a headed knockback 18 yards out. \n \nShaun Maloney nearly scored direct from a corner and Steven Fletcher hit the post but a foul on the goalkeeper was given the first time and the offside flag went up the second time. \n \nScotland failed to test the home goalkeeper and a succession of crosses and corners came to nothing in the final 15 minutes. \n \nStrachan said: "We didn't do enough to win the game. We definitely didn't do that much wrong to lose the game. \n \n"The game looked like a draw but if you get the first goal life is a lot simpler. We had to play catch-up when we lost the goal. \n \n"Before that, apart from one break, I didn't see any problems in the game. I felt comfortable. I was looking to get to half-time and tell them to up the tempo and think about a couple of things. \n \n"Then they scored and put on a great defensive show and got behind the ball and ready to break. Even then I didn't think there was a problem for us. \n \n"I thought we were a couple of yards away with our passes and intricate moves to try and get through, because we don't have the physical presence to fight them for a goal. \n \n"The lads were brave on the ball but maybe just a wee bit now and then, a foot or two here and there, we couldn't get through and it wasn't to be." \n \nNukri Revishvili's only save came from a deflected Charlie Mulgrew cross but Strachan said: "We can't just throw balls in there, we are not big enough or strong enough. So you have to work our way in there. If you want to do that you have to be precise. That was missing. \n   Promoted stories   \n"You only need one of those balls at somebody's feet and you've got a chance. When we do make a chance it's usually a good one because we are not a scrappy team. We have not got the presence up front to do that." \n \nDespite the game kicking off at 8pm local time, it remained hot and humid in the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena after temperatures hit the mid-30s this week. \n \n"I don't want the players or myself or anyone else to use that as an excuse because it could get lobbed in our faces," Strachan said. "We just have to accept what happened and accept we have to do better the next time with a couple of passes and be more precise." \n \nGeorgia manager Kakhaber Tskhadadze, who replaced Temuri Ketsbaia midway through the campaign, felt his side's second win in Group D was a major step forward but warned they have a tougher task in Dublin on Monday. \n \nTskhadadze, who was applauded into the media room, said: "I'd like to thank everyone for their support and especially the fans. It was a pity there were not more people here but hopefully the crowds come back. \n \n"It was important for our self-belief to win because it's teams of Scotland's quality that will be competing for places in major finals. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"The team were fantastic, especially the defence. Scotland did not really have a clear-cut chance. \n \n"It's no reason to celebrate for long though because we have a more difficult game in three days' time against Ireland and we will be focused on that game in a few hours."

0906_2a804a4e-ddf1-41a6-ad42-816a9c68f8fb	Ray: I have been listening to Tim May talk about the Buckeyes being six-time national champions\never since they defeated Oregon. In your 2015 season preview, the six national championships are\nmentioned again. What gives? \n \nAnyone not just getting to town knows that the Bucks have eight national championship trophies!\nJust because all of them were not “consensus” titles, they were titles nonetheless! \n \nWhat’s Tim’s problem? Maybe he is related to Mark May? \n \n — Pat Stuhldreher, Columbus  \n \n Pat: Here’s what I tell people: You celebrate however many Ohio State titles you like. We\nrecognize six, though “consensus” has nothing to do with it. In fact, two of OSU’s titles (1954 and\n’57) are shared and thus are not consensus at all. Our standard for pre-BCS championships are those\nawarded by a wire service (AP writers or UPI coaches), which excludes 1961 and ’70 — and,\ninterestingly, a lot of other years.  \n \nMr. Stein: I have to take exception to the ranking of “two leaves” for “Fun quotient” in the\nBottom Line (Tuesday). My wife and I had a great time. You didn’t think it was loud? You must have\nbeen sitting indoors. \n \nI have been at a white-out at Penn State, an OSU-Michigan game in the Big House, and the ’Shoe\nfor most of the largest crowds ever. My section of Lane Stadium was just as loud, and Hokies fans\nboisterously cheered their team until the game got out of hand and they had no real quarterback who\ncould stage any sort of comeback. \n \nAll the fans I met (I sat in a Hokies section, and tailgated in a reserved section of the\nparking lot) were friendly and courteous throughout. \n \nI am a Buckeye season-ticket holder and online Dispatch subscriber living in northern Virginia, and I can say that Virginia Tech has a\nbeautiful campus and a fervent fan base. \n \n — Bob Klocek  \n \n Fairfax Station, Va.  \n \n Bob: I don’t disagree about the campus scenery, but I sure didn’t get a sense of fever-pitch\nrowdiness from my press-box seat. The place was no mausoleum, especially in the second quarter, but\nit was a far cry from Madison or State College. It reminded me of OSU’s 1998 game against West\nVirginia in Morgantown, where the home fans expected their team to get thumped, and then were not\nsurprised.  \n \nEditor: I hope the Buckeyes players who were suspended for the first game are proud of\nthemselves — nothing like a selfish act to put your teammates in a bind right from the start. I\nrealize a championship team has to have depth, but that doesn’t give players with scholarships the\nOK to do as they please, knowing that they have someone to pick up their slack. \n \nThese young men are role models to kids who idolize them. So what do they take away from this?\nAre they learning that if they’re an important player, they can do what they please and let someone\nelse cover for their mistakes? \n \n — Terry Culp, Canal Winchester  \n \n Terry: Well, I suspect they’ve learned that they can’t do as they please, because they were\ndenied perhaps the one thing they cherish the most — playing time. That’s not nothing.  \n \nEditor: Nooooo!!! I watched the Wisconsin-Alabama game last Saturday night. Why was the hulking\nvisage of mega-chump Mark May appearing on my screen? \n \nI thought I had read, maybe back in January, that he had rightfully been dumped into the ash can\nof video history. \n \n — Richard Erb  \n \n Clear Brook, Va.  \n \n Richard: May was bounced from ESPN’s College Football Final about the same time Lou Holtz\ndeparted, but the network gave him another, less visible show to continue his shtick of banging on\nOhio State.  \n \nEditor: I am a graduate of Virginia Tech who was invited to the OSU-VT game on Monday by an OSU\nfan. I unfortunately sat in the OSU section. \n \nI have never experienced arrogant, taunting and offensive behavior like I saw Monday. Obviously,\nOSU has the better talent. While many OSU fans were enthusiastic and avid supporters of their team,\nmany others were cussing, booing, laughing at injured players, taking pictures and mocking VT fans\nleaving. Many were loud and abusive. \n \nWe gladly gave up our seats during the first half but saw the same behavior in other sections of\nthe stadium. \n \nYou may have one of the best college football teams in history, but you also have some of the\nmost unsportsmanlike fans I have ever seen. I hope the fan behavior improves as the season\nprogresses. \n \n — Thomas Sherrod  \n \n Statesville, N.C.  \n \n Thomas: Well, there’s always hope, even if for a few people it resides in a different area code\nfrom reality.  \n \nRay: As the NFL kicks off its season, it is absurd that the league will celebrate its 50th Super\nBowl at the end of the year. Did the league not have a championship game during its first 50\nseasons? Well, of course they did. \n \nIt was only called the NFL Championship, which is exactly what the Super Bowl represents. As a\nmatter of fact, the Cleveland Browns have won four championships. Yet they never receive the proper\ncredit because they all occurred prior to the championship game being called the Super Bowl. \n \nDuring the Browns’ first decade in the league, the team played in the championship game seven\ntimes, winning three. Yet not one football talking head mentions these historical feats, only that\nthe Browns are one of four teams that have never played in a Super Bowl. Granted, those\nchampionships were a long, long time ago, but I am old enough to remember the last one, in\n1964. \n \n — Steven H. Spring, South Charleston  \n \n Steven: I remember that last title, too. And I also remember about that time watching Jonny\nQuest and drinking Choc-Ola out of a can. In other words, a lot has changed since Gary Collins was\ncatching passes from Frank Ryan. The truth of the matter is the Super Bowl is the biggest sporting\nevent in the country, and the Browns have never been in it.  \n \nSports editor: As a transplanted Pittsburgher living now in central Ohio, I have been amazed at\nthe large number of Pittsburgh fans here, especially on the East Side. During football season, you\nwould think on Sunday that you were in a Pittsburgh suburb with all the people wearing their\nSteelers gear. \n \nBut The Dispatch ignores this whole section of readers, instead concentrating on the Bengals\nand Browns every day during the season. I can say it is rare that I see anyone wearing Browns gear\nin Columbus! \n \nPlease give the Steelers faithful in Columbus some coverage during the season! \n \n — Tom Thompson, Pickerington  \n \n Tom: Note to self: Stay away from the East Side, especially on Sundays.  \n \n*** \n \n Ray Stein is sports editor of The Dispatch.  \n \n rstein@dispatch.com

0908_19bc3777-94a7-4d86-903c-94504c7420df	Cindy Lehmann was a natural mother \n\nCINDY Lehmann was a natural mother.\n\nIn 26 years of foster caring, she and husband Rob Lehmann welcomed more than 300 children into their home.\n\nTogether they raised six of their biological children and took three of their foster children into permanent care.\n\nBut tragically the 58-year-old Warrnambool woman’s life was cut short when she died after a horrific crash in August.\n\nMrs Lehmann has been described as an incredible woman who provided love and a safe place for children who had been forgotten by the world.\n\nWith a quiet dignity, Mr Lehmann told The Standard how on the night of the accident their son Bo, who lived on Rooneys Road, rang and asked for a ride into work.\n\nMrs Lehmann and her son Joel drove the less than five-minute trip to Bo’s house and headed to the Rooneys Road and Raglan Parade intersection.\n\n“Fortunately Bo and Joel were on the passenger side of the car - Bo was in the middle seat and Joel in the front seat,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\n“She stopped at the lights, she looked up the road to see it was all clear. There were no traffic lights there.\n\n“She looked up and must have thought it was clear. She went across the intersection and the next thing Bo must have turned around and he said ‘truck’ and with that … bang.\n\n“The truck pushed the car and hit her driver’s side. Bo tried to grab the hand brake to stop it from moving or spinning.”\n\nMr Lehmann said 14-year-old Joel bravely ran back to Bo’s house to call for help while Bo, 24, stayed by his mum’s side.\n\n“I got to the intersection and I just saw all the ambulances,” he said.\n\n“They’d gotten her out of the car. I just couldn’t believe it. The car was in a U shape.\n\n“She had severe head injuries and we went to emergency in Warrnambool.\n\n“When I finally saw her, she was in a bad way.”\n\nMrs Lehmann was later airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition.\n\nMr Lehmann said early CT scans didn’t reveal the extent of her injuries because of swelling.\n\n“She also had fractured ribs, a fractured jaw, a fractured elbow – all things that could get better,” he said.\n\n“The main thing was the trauma to her head. It was just a harrowing week. We were in there talking to her, telling her, ‘wake up, Mum’.”\n\nMr Lehmann was on his way home to Warrnambool to check on his family when he got a call to return to the hospital because the MRI results were back and they weren’t good.\n\n“My heart just dropped,” he said.\n\n“All the thinking there might have been some glimmer of hope.\n\n“We had the big family meeting and they said her whole brain was severely damaged beyond repair and she’d never wake up.\n\n“We all sat down and had to make a big decision.\n\n“She always said to me, ‘if I end up like that, I don’t want to live like that’ - and I’m the same. I don’t want to live relying on a ventilator to keep me alive, but it was a pretty hard decision to make.\n\n“With the vibration she was hit, the whole brain shook and damaged everything in the brain, which she wouldn't wake up from. It’s really hard.”\n\nMrs Lehmann died two days before the couple’s 40th wedding anniversary.\n\nMr and Mrs Lehmann met at a fellowship function and their relationship soon blossomed.\n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Mr Lehmann worked full-time and Mrs Lehmann did family day care. It was from that work Mrs Lehmann saw there were children in need of a loving and secure home.\n\n“She turned around to me one day and said, ‘How about we do foster care?’,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\n“We only had a young family then and the kids were more or less brought up with foster care, but we did talk to them about it. It just snowballed and we’ve been doing it ever since.\n\n“We were a good team and we just felt sorry to see the plight of these kids. More than anything you could just see the way they came to her.\n\n“We just wanted to give them that care that they didn’t have.”\n\nMr Lehmann said although foster care work was challenging, the rewards always outweighed any difficult experiences.\n\n“We’ve had our hard cases - the real demanding cases and some we couldn’t handle,” he said.\n\n“We did everything we possibly we could.\n\n“We’ve had some that left us that have gone on the downward spiral. We’ve had phone calls from some who have gone on to be doctors and just blossomed with their careers and lives. That just made us absolutely happy.”\n\nMrs Lehmann was recognised as carer of the year in the statewide Robert Clark Memorial awards in 2012.\n\nFoster care team leader Marion Noye, from Brophy Family and Youth Services, said Mrs Lehmann had the ability to accept and love all the children who came into her care.\n\nShe said those incredible skills had been passed on by Mr and Mrs Lehmann to their other children.\n\n“You always knew that when you placed a child in the Lehmann house they were going to be safe and happy,” she said.\n\nBrophy chief executive Francis Broekman said Mrs Lehmann was an extraordinary woman who opened her house to children who had often been forgotten and were unable to live at home.\n\n“She offered them love and unconditional support,” he said.\n\n“She and Rob offered their home to children and were able to repair trauma in them.\n\n“They showed them there were people in the world who loved them for who they were.”\n\nMore than 500 people attended Mrs Lehmann’s funeral on September 11 and she was celebrated and remembered as a kind and caring woman who was always doing things for other people.\n\n“It was heartwarming that she was loved by so many but very sad that someone was taken who was so special to me and everybody else,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\nMrs Lehmann also volunteered as a football trainer at Merrivale, Old Collegians and later at Koroit.\n\n“She loved doing that. It was just her break to get away from the family,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\n“She was a wonderful, caring person and she just thought of everybody she was involved with.”\n\nMr Lehmann said he planned to continue the foster care work and he was grateful for the support from family, friends and the community.\n\n“I just want to move on doing exactly what she would like me to do,” he said.\n\n“It’d be nothing to come home at night and see two new faces as I walked in the door and I’d say, ‘Oh Cindy who are these?’ and she’d say, ‘These are so and so. We’ve only got them for a week’.\n\n“Then that week would turn into weeks and months. We’d bring them into our family and bring them up the same way we brought up our kids.\n\n“She was just a natural mother around the home. She was a wonderful mum.”\n\nStory courtesy of The Standard

0910_d2589e20-bd42-4e20-a8c0-9684cda04f30	WASHINGTON (CNN) – President Barack Obama and 2016 presidential candidates paid tribute to legendary baseball player Yogi Berra — a cultural icon and one of the greatest catchers in history — who died Tuesday night at the age of 90. \n\n“Yogi Berra was an American original — a Hall of Famer and humble veteran; prolific jokester and jovial prophet,” Obama said in a statement. “He epitomized what it meant to be a sportsman and a citizen, with a big heart, competitive spirit, and a selfless desire to open baseball to everyone, no matter their background. Michelle and I offer our deepest condolences to his family, his friends, and his fans in New York and across the world.” \n\nSharing one of Berra’s most famous quotes, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted “‘Baseball is 90% mental—the other half is physical.’ Yogi gave everything at least 140%. We’ll miss him. My prayers are with his family.” \n\nIn light of Pope Francis’ historic trip to the United States, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted an anecdote about Berra and Pope John XXIII. \n\n“When asked if he had an audience with Pope John XXIII, Yogi Berra replied ‘No, but I met with him.’ Am sure they’re meeting again today. RIP,” Bush tweeted. \n\nAnd billionaire real-estate mogul Donald Trump shared a photo of himself with Berra at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, New York on Instagram. \n\n“Yogi Berra was not only a great baseball player, he was a great guy. Yogi will be missed,” Trump wrote.

New York State’s Division of Tourism dubbed I Love NY hosted a special Culinary Harvest ‘Beer Garden’ inside of the luxury of the East 27th Street ballroom, an in-person ode to the change in seasons, earmarked by seasonal dishes and refreshing cold weather inspired spirits. With a sizable open bar on one side and a full-on game of corn hole being played on the other, there was plenty of activity to pique the interests of attendees during the three hour affair. \n \nThough there was plenty to enjoy during the evening- from the food to the drink to the interactive games- the night’s primary focus was the promotion of New York state and the incredible aspects that lay outside of the comforts of city life. The rich history of sporting events, the rural agriculture, the picturesque rolling green mountains and the combination of seemingly endless vineyards and distilleries for touring make New York a far more diverse place than the urban jungle might otherwise have you believe. Despite a multitude of attractive features from Long Island to upstate, in order to keep job growth moving forward and funding progressing, it’s important that the state continue to promote the adventure, the excitement and the pageantry that most of us probably take for granted and are missing out on. \n \nBeating the ninety degree New York City heat, we caught our breath for a moment by grabbing a deliciously thirst quenching pour from Tousey Winery, where their crispy Chardonnay was both versatile and refreshing. With hunger pangs aching, we washed down delicious bites of “Goat Cheese Flan” courtesy of The Gould Hotel , which was a perfect marriage of sweet and savory. Moist and flavorful with a drizzle of honey at the bottom of the plate, Chef Christopher Kuhns also served up an inventive garden-grown green tomato chutney spread over a simple cracker and slice of cheddar, which was just as mouth watering as the flan itself. \n \nBetween savory bites, pours of Defiant Beer – especially their Fall classic “Pumpkin Ale” left us yearning for falling leaves and Halloween scents as we slugged down repeated pours. With each passing beer, guests managed to stop different waitresses with trays of passed around fare from BBQ dishes to New York State Fair style corn dogs. But despite the hankering for fall- it was hard to allow freshly shucked oysters to pass us by. With that in mind, the friendly pairing of Empire Oysters and The Oysterhood doled out ice cold mollusks layered with shaved horseradish and a selection of spice-filled condiments in anticipation of NYC Oyster Week, which rolls through September 27th. \n \nOther highlights included the likes of Chef Robert Borden ‘s pairing of wild American meat and poultry alongside some delicious sushi, fried seaweed and freshly prepared guacamole, Chef Julie Taboulie ‘s (paired up with Empire Beer , both from Syracuse) live demonstration and serving of savory “Salt City Potatoes” and Chef Rich Parente ‘s inventive “Fried Rabbit and Waffles with Red-Eye Gravy,” a deliciously experimental take on the traditional chicken meets waffles comfort dish. Booze-fueled pours from Doc’s Draft Ciders, the Long Island Wine Council and Finger Lakes Hard Cider were pleasantly fulfilling as we awaited some of the event’s more poignant moments. \n \nSpeaking on behalf of the New York State Division of Tourism, Ross Levi put the entirety of the evening in perspective as the assembled crowd continued to indulge in some of the state’s locally produced eats and drinks. 2014 saw visitor spending increase by more than 5%, including the state’s most visited year by overseas travelers in it’s last 14. Moreover, employment increased by more than 20,000 jobs year over year as sporting events like the Belmont Stakes and statewide tourism brought more and more folks to other parts of the state. While the focus- and Wednesday evening’s event for that matter- continues to be in the five boroughs that comprise the New York City area, there is a preponderance of activity outside of our realms- most of which are just a short commute away- that are both eye opening and mouthwatering, given that they continue to flourish right in our very own backyards. \n - Alexandra Fetsey \n  \nFood Highlights from Culinary Harvest “Beer Garden” 2015 \n \n \nThe Gould Hotel – Seneca Falls: “Goat Cheese Flan ” & “Green Tomato Chutney” \n \n \n  \n \nEmpire Oyster – The Adirondacks: “Trout with Granny Smith Apples ” & “Pan Roasted Venison, Petit Fall Squash” \n \n \n  \n \nSachi Asian Bistro \n \n \n  \n \nClocktower Grill – Hudson Valley: “Chicken Fried Rabbit & Waffles with Local Kale Slaw & Red Eye Gravy” \n \n \n\n \nJulie Taboulie – Syracuse: “Stuffed Syracuse Salt Potatoes a la Julie Taboulie Style” \n \n \n\n \nCity to Table:  “Local Cheeses and Charcuterie, Candied Bacon, Rick’s Picks Veggies”  \n \n  \n \nSmokehouse of the Catskills: “Pork and Chicken”
0913_10af65a5-41a3-49e3-964c-8fa98370ee39	Ireland boss Joe Schmidt declared that his side's World Cup starts now after they claimed a convincing bonus-point victory over Romania. \n \nThe 44-10 win at Wembley sees Ireland move to the top of Pool D but their progress to the quarter-finals will depend on tougher tests against both France and, more immediately, Italy next Sunday. \n \nIreland can guarantee qualification to the knock-out stages if they beat the Italians at the Olympic Stadium but it will be important to finish first too, given reigning champions New Zealand could lie in wait for the runners-up. \n \n"Next week is the pivotal week," Schmidt said. \n \n"It's where we can qualify ourselves. The game against France just decides who we play in the quarter-final if we can win next week. \n \n"It's pressure for us and pressure for Italy. That's why people come to a World Cup - they want to see how teams respond to the pressure cooker environment." \n \nSchmidt added: "We know we can qualify if we win next weekend. Italy, after a win and a loss, need to win next weekend to qualify. It becomes a last-16 game for us." \n \nIreland are sweating on the fitness of Rob Kearney for the match after he injured himself scoring the fifth try shortly after coming on as a substitute. \n \n"Rob was involved in a high-speed play after coming on the pitch and just after scoring the try he's jarred himself," Schmidt said. \n \n"We hope it's not too much but the next 24 to 48 hours will tell if he's done anything telling for next week. \n \n"It's through his glute and hip. It happened when his knee hit the ground." \n \nLosing Kearney would be a blow to Ireland but a number of players put their hand up for selection after a dominant performance against Romania. \n \nSchmidt made 12 changes with Italy and France in mind, but his altered line-up showed few signs of weakness, scoring six tries, including four in the second half. \n   Promoted stories   \nTommy Bowe and Keith Earls crossed the line twice each, before Kearney and Chris Henry added two more late on, and Simon Zebo also staked a claim with an impressive display at full-back. \n \n"There were a number of players who performed really well and will create a big of selection headache for Italy," Schmidt said. \n \n"I don't think you're ever totally satisfied. We know we've been imperfect but it's a difficult thing to work through a couple of games where you're heavily favoured." \n \nEarls' second try was his seventh at World Cups, bringing him level with Brian O'Driscoll as Ireland's top-scorer in the tournament's history. \n \n"It's nice for him to be mentioned in the same sentence as Brian O'Driscoll," Schmidt said.  "Because that's the standard that any Irish player in the backline wants to reach." \n \nEarls' milestone came in front of 89,267 fans at Wembley, a record attendance at a Rugby World Cup, beating the 89,019 that watched New Zealand beat Argentina earlier in the tournament. \n \n"It's pretty empowering," Ireland captain Jamie Heaslip said. \n \n"You try block a lot of it out during the game to be composed but their energy bleeds into the squad. \n \n"When you're digging deep and you're blowing hard they do pick you up. The support has blown the squad away to be honest." \n \nRomania managed a consolation try late on through Ovidiu Tonita but they were largely outclassed and head coach Lynn Howells is also targeting the remaining games against Canada, who they play next, and Italy for a victory. \n \n"The first two games against France and Ireland, once we knew the draw, it was about competing and showing everybody we can compete at this level," Howells said. \n \n"I think we've managed that. Now as far as Romania are concerned we're probably playing a semi-final and a final now." \n \nThere was one success for the Romanian squad as scrum-half Florin Surugiu proposed to his girlfriend on the Wembley pitch after the match. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"I tried to advise him not to but there you go," Howells said. \n \n"She said yes. It's too romantic for me but I'm sure she enjoyed every minute of it."
0914_caf89d24-e2c4-4fe6-bc5c-10230764d5ed	Hidden charges make me see red. I know from sad experience that if you don't check all the small print, you're almost asking to be taken for a ride – but still I get caught out. And I was caught out this summer simply because I had tried to be clever and cut costs. \n    \nThe story centres on spending money on a foreign holiday. The cheapest way to do is to use a prepaid currency card that has no usage charges, no loading fees and no charges when you take money out. \n\nOnce you apply and receive a card, you can simply transfer cash from your current account online – and, if you're really lucky, you can buy currency when the pound is strong ahead of your trip. Do that and you'll be quids in – or euros in – giving you extra holiday cash to spend. \n\nOnce it's arrived you have a card – normally backed by MasterCard – that you can use at most restaurants and shops or even cashpoints abroad. And you won't be facing an unexpected bill when you get home as a result of so-called currency conversion fees or double charging by banks. \n\nWhen I looked into holiday money a couple of years ago, I discovered the exchange rates on most of the cards were also much better than you could get on the high street or at airports. So it made perfect sense to snap up a My Travel Cash card, load it up, and use it to spend abroad on our family holiday that year. \n\nAll went well. It was accepted everywhere we went and I was able to take cash out of overseas ATMs with no worries and no extra charge. The amount we paid – or took out of the cash machine – was the amount taken off the card: simple! When we returned, there was even around €80 still on the card, which I thought would be a good kickstart for our spending next time we went abroad. \n\nAs it happened, that wasn't until this summer. When we talked about holiday money I smugly produced my card and said: "We'll use this. It's already got a fistful of euros on it." But it hadn't. \n\nI had made the cardinal sin of not checking the small print thoroughly and therefore missed the fact that the card has a punitive "inactivity" fee of €2.50 a month. So putting the card away in advance of our next foreign trip – which happened to be 24 months later – ended up costing me around €60. In a stroke that ate up all the potential savings I'd made, both on the holiday back in 2013 and probably every holiday I'll have in the future. Thanks, My Travel Cash! \n\nThe company's website lists 11 free (or "FREE", as it screams the message) services offered by the card before mentioning the expensive inactivity fee. There's no discussion of the vengeful joy of breaking the card into little bits. But I bet they'd charge a fee for that too, if they could. \n\nThere is, of course, a €4 card replacement fee, which hits the hasty.
0915_5bb17a4c-94b9-49bb-815d-2c8c55570bb8	CALGARY - During the four months her foot didn't touch the ground, Hayley Wickenheiser wondered if she'd walk normally again, let alone skate. \n \n\n                            She was able to do both in time to re-join the Canadian women's hockey team for this week's camp in Calgary. \n \n\n                            Canada's all-time leading scorer underwent season-ending surgery in Toronto on Feb. 18 to have a plate and eight screws inserted in her left foot. \n \n\n                            She played in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, with a broken bone in that foot. Wickenheiser had a screw surgically implanted in it just over a year ago, but pain continued to dog her. \n \n\n                            Of the slings and arrows Wickenheiser has played through in her two decades wearing the Maple Leaf, this one had the potential to end her career. \n \n\n                            So when Wickenheiser's surgeon told her she couldn't put weight on her foot for four months, she obeyed. \n \n\n                            "It was a pretty serious injury to the point where they said if you put any weight on it you could risk long-term damage," Wickenheiser said Tuesday at WinSport's Markin MacPhail Centre. \n \n\n                            "This is the most serious injury I've ever had in my career — a lot of dark days wondering if I'd ever walk normally again. I did everything the surgeon said" \n \n\n                            In the weeks following surgery, Wickenheiser did one-legged windsprints using a scooter and wrapped her cast in a garbage bag so she could swim laps. \n \n\n                            "I had to be very creative in my training and my rehab, but I think I made really good progress in the span of six months to be back here," she said. \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser started skating in July, but she's held off on running and jumping in dryland training. \n \n\n                            "The bone is now fully healed," she said. "If I was a sprinter or a track athlete I wouldn't be back at this point, but because it's hockey I can get away with that lateral push and it doesn't seem to bother me." \n \n\n                            Jayna Hefford's retirement last week at age 38 makes Wickenheiser, 37, the elder stateswoman on the national women's team. \n \n\n                            Of the 47 women invited to training camp, only Wickenheiser and goaltender Charline Labonte are in their 30s. \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser and Hefford are the only two Canadian women to have played in all five Olympic women's hockey tournaments. They won gold in four of them. \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser also played softball for Canada in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Her foot responding the way it has, she was contemplating a seventh Olympic appearance in the 2018 Winter Games. \n \n\n                            "I'd like to play through 2018," Wickenheiser said. "Today, I don't see any reason why I can't. Physically I'm fitter than I've ever been really, considering my foot and the way I was able to come back and feel pretty healthy and good on the ice." \n \n\n                            She intends to play a full season with the Calgary Inferno of the Canadian Women's Hockey League, as well as represent Canada again at November's Four Nations Cup and the 2016 women's world championship in Kamloops, B.C. \n \n\n                            The five-foot-10, 162-pound forward from Shaunavon, Sask., leads Canada all-time in goals (168), assists (207), games played (270) and penalty minutes (312). \n \n\n                            She was captain of the Canadian team that won Olympic gold in 2010 and assistant captain in 2014 in Sochi, but she's now faced with carving a new role for herself. \n \n\n                            Hockey Canada is grooming players such as Marie-Philip Poulin, Rebecca Johnston, Natalie Spooner, Haley Irwin, Lauriane Rougeau and Laura Fortino to be Canada's captains and assistant captains. Where does that leave one of the most decorated women in hockey? \n \n\n                            Women's team general manager Melody Davidson, who coached Wickenheiser in both the 2006 and 2010 Olympics, says making sure Wickenheiser's foot is healthy is the first hurdle upon her return.   \n \n\n                            "Then it's what does she want her role to be, where does she fit it, where do we see her? We've only had her at one camp since Sochi," Davidson said. \n \n\n                            "You can't teach her compete level, her intensity and her willingness to do whatever it takes to win a hockey game and be successful. There's a lot of learnings there for the younger players to observe and see. A lot of them have never played with her or never even been to a camp with her." \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser accepts the leadership torch has been passed to the 20-somethings. \n \n\n                            "I've been around for a long time, played on the team for a long time," she said. "My voice has been around for a long time, so I think it's nice to have a fresh, new look going forward. \n \n\n                            "Others have to step up and carry some of that load now and that's a nice thing. I still do the same things I've always done and led by example, play hard and train hard and all those things." \n \n\n                            The Canadian women play a series of exhibition games against Alberta Midget Hockey League teams starting Thursday. Their camp concludes Sunday. \n \n\n                            By Donna Spencer, The Canadian Press
0916_18e18bca-7313-41d9-b636-827cce77433e	Stormy skies can be restful \n \nWarnings for : musings ( 1 ), mentions of vigorous exercise, and substitute swear words (“Cuss Lite”(TM) \n \nI have given up swearing for autumn, and taking up running til at least early December. It remains to seen which one proves more chuffin’ difficult. \n \nI’ve probably whinged before – and undoubtedly, unless WordPress shuts me down, or the world ends, will again – about the fact that new immigrants to the UK do not receive a handbook on arrival. Nor did the “Life in the UK” test cover such useful subjects as food, old telly shows, or swearing. \n \n“Life in the UK” did ( 2 ) include a section on sport, though it was comparatively brief compared to such useful bits of information as, “What percentage of the Welsh population are from ethnic minorities?” According to my husband, who’s a Yorkshireman, and helped me study, the real answer is, “All of them: they’re Welsh.” \n \nThe citizenship exams are probably on my mind because a Polish lady we know has just sat her English exam, and is sitting her “Life” exam next. The subjects of immigration, refugees, and the like are also in the news and, judging from my own life, a heated topic of conversation. \n \nIt’s also nearly five years since I officially became a British subject. I say “officially” because both practically and emotionally, I already thought of myself as Anglo-American. On a practical level, I had worked, paid taxes – including National Insurance (NI) – and did my best to follow laws and rules such as putting my bins out on the correct day. I’d also become involved in local causes, politics, and charities, as well as given money, and, quite literally, blood. \n \nWhich brings me to my latest charitable venture, and the Shoes of Extreme Pinkness: \n \nSee? \n \nSo far, the shoes and several pairs of socks are the only kit which I’ve purchased for the fund raiser I’m running on Sunday 6 December: the 10k “Percy Pud” race in Sheffield . \n \nI do have one other bit of kit which I have been wearing whilst training: a t-shirt given to me by one of the two charities I’ll be raising funds for, Combat Stress . The other charity is also a mental health one, and is specifically round a project(s) aimed at helping people in my adopted home town of Doncaster. \n \nBecause, whilst I’ll always be American – and tick the “ White, Other ” box on forms – I consider myself to be not only British in law, but by choice, and heart. \n \nBecause, in part, I was allowed to make that choice. I was and am white, speak English , and am not – directly, at least ( 3 ) – perceived as belonging to a “scary” category of immigrant. \n \nNext time someone asks “But why don’t the such-and-such – fill in the blank with the ethnic and/or religious group of your choice – assimilate?” – ask yourselves: are we honestly giving people a real choice to join in? \n \nSwans on still waters: Doncaster, 2015 \n \n( 1 ) This blog is subtitled “Musings of a British Eccentric”, so it’s on the tin \n( 2 ) As of Spring 2010 \n( 3 ) I am half-Romanian on my dad’s side

0918_c84322c1-aa3b-4429-99d0-12cb3413804b	This has been a disaster of a legislative session for transparency. Earlier this week we noted the turkey that would prevent cities from shedding light on union negotiations, or even getting an independent financial analysis of them. Here's another bad bill on Gov. Jerry Brown's desk: AB 1544, which would do away with the state-mandated reporting of government payments made at the behest of an elected official, a rule that makes it easy to track political influence in obtaining government money for private companies or individuals.\n\nOf the 120 members of the Assembly and Senate, 112 voted for it. But Brown gets the final say with his veto. He should listen to Jodi Remke, whom he appointed last year to chair the state Fair Political Practices Commission.\n\n"This bill would roll back current law and lessen transparency," Remke wrote the governor last week. "Elected officials would no longer need to disclose when they request or solicit government money on behalf of others -- even when those government funds are being given to for-profit corporations and private individuals and organizations."\n\nThe FPPC says elected state officials this year alone have reported more than $15 million in requests to government agencies. Millions have gone to private companies.\n\nTo understand why this matters, consider the biggest example this year: Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, asked the California Energy Commission to award a $3.4 million grant to Viridis Fuels of Oakland.In April, the energy commission approved the grant, to build a plant that will manufacture up to 20 million gallons per year of biodiesel fuel and 4 million gallons of technical-grade glycerin.\n\nThen, on June 6, Viridis CEO Kathy Neal contributed $1,000 to Bonta's re-election campaign, and her ex-husband, Elihu Harris, former assemblyman and former mayor of Oakland who is listed as chairman of Viridis' advisers, contributed $250. The company's president, Mario Juarez, had already contributed $500 to Bonta.\n\nThis is the sort of money trail that the state's Political Reform Act aims to expose -- and the Legislature now wants to hide. Under AB 1544, Bonta would not have been required to report his requests on Viridis' behalf, so the gifts from Neal and others wouldn't have raised eyebrows.\n\nAs Remke wrote, "This disclosure is vital because it helps to identify actual or perceived influence individuals may have over elected officials."\n\nThe Political Reform Act was written at Brown's instigation when he was secretary of state and approved by voters in 1974. It can be changed with approval by the governor and two-thirds of the Legislature.\n\nReporting of so-called behested payments was not required in the original act. The Legislature wisely added them in 1997. Now, it wants to narrow the scope so elected officials don't have to report government payouts made at their urging.\n\nIf members had nothing to hide, they wouldn't have a problem with the law. That's why it has to stay as it is. The governor needs to stop it.
0919_37149bd8-6033-494d-aefe-b55312a71dc4	LONDON , Sept. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Hortonworks, Inc. (NASDAQ: HDP ), the leader in Open Enterprise Hadoop, today announced it has expanded its European customer base with the addition of Open Energi, a company harnessing flexibility in demand for energy. Open Energi has selected the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP™) to transform the way energy is delivered and consumed through smart grids with Hadoop-powered, real-time, Internet of Things (IoT) data. \n \nSmart grids, powered by sensor data, allow energy consumption to be managed in real-time based on immediate demand and supply data rather than historic patterns of energy use. With HDP, the industry’s only Open Enterprise Hadoop solution, Open Energi will help organisations gain valuable insights by analysing real-time information based on data streamed from over 3,000 electricity consuming assets and meters around the United Kingdom . \n \nHortonworks and Open Energi: Building the Virtual Power Station \n \nOpen Energi’s patented demand response technology is helping to drive momentum behind smart grids by enabling organisations – including the likes of Sainsbury’s, United Utilities and Aggregate Industries – to turn energy-intensive equipment such as fridges, pumps and fans into “smart devices” which can alter their energy use intelligently in response to fluctuations in electricity supply and demand nationwide. Its unique Dynamic Demand technology aggregates consumption across its customers’ sites to provide a fast, flexible solution equivalent to a power station, only instead of adjusting supply up or down, it adjusts demand to meet supply. \n \nUsing HDP, Open Energi will collect, store and analyse sensor data containing information about real-time electricity consumption and control processes more efficiently and at a far greater scale than previously possible. Additionally, HDP will provide a single view of all this information to enable organisations to react swiftly to changing conditions on the grid, and identify ways to generate extra revenue from existing assets, maximise energy savings and spot opportunities to reduce CO 2 emissions. \n \n“Our vision is to build the world’s first virtual power station and we aim to do that by developing a smarter platform built around smarter demand,” explained David Hill , Business Development Director, Open Energi . “Using the HDP in combination with the IoT will enable us to make connections between a wider range of disparate datasets at a far greater scale, so that we can provide organisations with a previously unattainable level of insight into their use of energy and ultimately create an energy system which is cleaner, cheaper and more secure.” \n \nHadoop and the Internet of Things: Better together \n \nAs more devices connect to the IoT, an ever-increasing amount of data is being created that can offer valuable insight into a number of areas. In addition to supporting the optimisation of smart grids, Open Enterprise Hadoop’s ability to accommodate over 1 trillion files through an internet-scale storage layer can be used to track everything from weather patterns to supporting the healthcare industry to more effectively record and monitor patients’ vital statistics and other health indicators.  \n \n“Data is the driving force behind a smarter energy grid and with access to more accurate technology, it is now possible to build a far more detailed picture of energy usage,” said Andy Leaver , Vice President of International Operations, Hortonworks. “Through its use of the Hortonworks Data Platform, Open Energi will have real-time information and insight into grid conditions that can be fed back to customers help them make more informed decisions about their energy consumption. This collaboration is a great example of Hortonworks’ momentum internationally as more customers in more industries turn to Hortonworks to solve their big data problems.” \n \nAdditional Resources \n \nHortonworks DataFlow:                     http://hortonworks.com/products/dataflow/ \n \nHortonworks to Acquire Onyara:        http://hortonworks.com/blog/hortonworks-acquires-onyara/ \n \nHortonworks Customers:                  http://hortonworks.com/customers/ \n \nAbout Hortonworks \n \nHortonworks is the leader in accelerating business transformations with Open Enterprise Hadoop by developing, distributing and supporting an enterprise-scale data platform built entirely on open source technology including Apache™ Hadoop®.

Solutions such as this, coupled with on-site generation and energy storage technologies means that the energy market is no longer a linear value chain driven by fossil fuel production but is becoming bi-directional; creating a new energy economy where energy consumers can both take and provide service back to the grid and generate revenue. \n \nMedia Contact:  \nMichelle Lazzar \n408-828-9681 \ncomms@hortonworks.com \n \nLogo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140227/SF73721LOGO   \n \n  \n \nSource: PrNewsWire All \n Hortonworks and Open Energi to Deliver Smarter Energy Grid
0920_85adf986-0acf-4616-af5d-669aa50e89eb	Fairfield City Schools will break ground on its new buildings next month, about five months earlier than planned. \n\nIn a special meeting this morning, the board of education approved three amendments that will allow construction manager Skanska-Megan to begin the site work on all three buildings as early as next month, officials said. \n\nThe buildings are still scheduled to open for the 2017-18 school year, but by starting early, the district hopes to save some money, according to Treasurer Nancy Lane. Because the work has not been contracted out yet, Lane said she didn’t know exactly how much the savings would be. \n\nThe district is building a new Central Elementary, a new freshman school, and a new yet-to-be-named elementary school building. Voters approved the $80 million project after passing a $61 million bond issue last year; the state will contribute the other $19 million. The site work is expected to cost $4 million. \n\n“This is starting the dirt work while we’ve got a couple of good months of weather before winter,” said Peter Becker, project executive for Skanska-Megan. “Everything’s still on track … if you do it in the spring and you’ve got a wet spring, you’re behind the eight-ball for being ready to start the structure.” \n\nThe early site work involves getting the dirt to the proper levels for construction. The actual construction is not expected to be until the spring, but the groundbreaking ceremony will be held sometime in mid-October, he said. \n\n“Right now, what the district is doing is saving money, because you don’t have to spend a lot of money drying dirt in the spring,” Becker said. \n\nBoard member Dan Hare suggested regular community updates on the project, noting there was confusion about the district’s renovated stadium, which fell behind schedule, requiring the district to move its first home game to Lakota East High School.

0922_fa529766-124a-47dd-9d56-2f314a26dbdd	My poor Erik, has been getting the brunt of my attention the past couple of months.\nAside from the sleeping issues (resolved hopefully), he also struggles with homework.  This has been an issue from the first day he walked into school (pre-k).  Erik is smart but writing has always been a major struggle for him.   When asked to write, anything, he panics and throws a tantrum.\nI had dealt with this in the past by carving out one-on-one time each weekend to help him through it in one day so we didn't have to struggle through it during the week.  This year, that's not possible, which actually is probably a blessing because it's forcing me to address the real issue.\nI've wondered in the past whether or not his writing reluctance was behavioral or a learning issue.\nThis year though, I'm pretty sure it is a learning issue.\nErik never fusses about any homework that doesn't involve writing - spelling city, the math website, reading.  His reluctance is only related to writing.\nWhen I ask him what the issue you he says, " I have the answer in my head mom, like my head is a paper, but I can't get it out."\nHe is a fairly quiet kid, who has never played pretend, told stories, etc.  Basically his expressive language seems to be somewhat delayed.  He's been in counseling, due to the sleep and marriage issues, and his counselor has mentioned to me that he is very slow to answer her questions (has to think before he speaks for quite sometime and seems unable to express how he is feeling aside from being "fine).   He also struggles with tying his shoes and can not tell left from right.\nHis kindergarten teacher mentioned in two report cards that he was slow to finish his work, seemed distractable.   I spoke with his first grade teacher briefly this week, and she said she had also noticed this last year, primarily in math where he could tell her the answer but really struggled to show his work.\nI have told his second grade teacher about our struggles with writing homework and she spoke with the school psychologist who gave her some ideas to try and identify what is the main issue.\nThis writing issue has never been a true issue at school though because academically erik is ahead of his grade level - so he hasn't had to worry about the actual work, and has been able to focus solely on writing the answers.   As the school work becomes harder, I am really concerned that he will fall behind as he won't immediately know the answers anymore and will have to actually work on the answers PLUS the writing.  Yikes!\nSo here is what we are doing so far....\n1) Mom gave me some very good ideas regarding homework.  She suggested with the reading response homework that instead of using a book he has read that week (his reading is very advanced) he use a book more appropriate to a second grader (Gingerbread Man style book).  This level of book will make figuring out the answers much easier, so he doesn't have to struggle through finding the answer and the writing.\nMom knows Erik and wasn't surprised he was struggling with writing as she has noted his limited expressive language in the past.  She explained that in order to show your work/write, you have to get an idea from your head to paper, which is a more advanced skill than getting your answer from your head to your mouth.   Erik struggles to get the answer from his head to his mouth; so it's no surprise the more advance step (head to paper) has been a big struggle for him.  This week I had him dictate the answers to me, I wrote them out, and he copied them.  I did the same for him in math and it went SO much better!!!  I am going to do this for a number of weeks.  Then, if it continues to go well, I am going to try to have him look at my written work for a little bit, but then see if he can write the answer on his own.\n2) His counselor, who is a elementary school counselor and a licensed pediatric therapist, is going to work through some material she uses for her autistic kids on helping them express their emotions. (Erik isn't autistic, but struggles with some of the same communication skills.)\n3) His teacher is aware and watching him for this, early assessments have been put in place. I feel much better about everything now than I did two weeks ago, because at least we have some things in place to help my little buddy.\nThe ability to communicate (emotions) is something Victor has always struggled with and was a big part of why our marriage has struggled/failed.  I feel an intense need to equip Erik with these skills as he also really struggles with that.\nPlease keep my sweet boy in your prayers!
0923_b8cda84d-cf9b-40ef-8aae-a74eefe5ba5f	Google’s September 29th event announced this morning is rumoured to be where we’ll see the first sight of the new Chromecast, but more importantly new Nexus phones. The rumour this year is that we’ll see two Neuxs phones with one built by LG and a larger model built by Huawei, and now there seems to be names for them. \n \nThe LG built Nexus, known internally at Google by the fishy name ‘Bullhead’, will be called the Nexus 5X according to a rumour from Android Authority a couple of weeks back which also rumoured the price to begin at US$400. Overnight the guys at DroidLife have apparently received confirmation from a source of theirs that the Nexus 6 2015 , known internally at Google by it’s fish codename of ‘Angler’, will be called the Nexus 6P . \n \nNexus 5X \n\n \nSpec wise, the LG built Nexus 5X will have a 5.2″ screen, though rumours about resolution are split between 1080P and QHD (2560×1440). A Snapdragon 808 is very heavily rumoured to be under the hood with 3GB of RAM with either 16GB or 32GB of storage and powered by a 2700mAh battery. \n \nThe rear of the phone shown in leaks to date have shown a protruding camera bump which will house a 12.3MP camera which may include Optical Image Stabilisation and from the looks of it, laser auto-focus is included as well next to an LED Flash. \n \nColour wise, the phone look set to come in the traditional ‘Panda’ colour options of Black (or possibly a Dark Blue) and White, but a recent leak pointed towards a mint colour option as well, though that could just be a prototype with Google playing around with colour variants. \n \nNexus 6P \n\n                   \nGoogle’s big (hah) hope this year is the larger screened Nexus 6P built by partner Huawei – currently the number 1 manufacturer of mobile phones in China and number 3 manufacturer in the world. The Huawei Nexus partnership is an important one for Google with hopes that the Huawei Nexus will be a bridge for the company into the potentially highly lucrative Chinese market. \n \nThe larger screened Nexus 6P with its 5.7″ QHD (2560×1440) resolution display is set to be a more premium option with a rumoured metal body construction along the lines of their recent  P8 and Mate S launches which have shown the manufacturing prowess of the company to build a solid piece of hardware. \n \nUnder that metal body hood is rumoured to be a Snapdragon 810 (V2.1) processor with cores clocked at 1.9GHz and 3GB of RAM. Storage options range from 32-128GB on this option according to some rumours, finally ending the 16GB option. A massive battery over 3,000mAh is expected to power the Nexus 6P which when paired with new power saving features such as Doze in Android Marshmallow, could mean great battery life. \n \nRumours for the camera point to a camera similar to that of the Nexus 5X, with a 12.3MP camera with OIS and laser auto-focus. As you can see from the leaked photo above, the phone has a unique camera bump on the rear. \n \nNexus \nBeing a dual release, the Nexus phones will both feature a fingerprint scanner, a feature backed up by both leaks of the phones and the announcement of fingerprint support in Android Marshmallow that the Nexus phones are built as reference devices for. Also, though not shown as yet in anything other than renders, the phones will both have a USB-C connector on the bottom of the phone, something that Google advised during I/O this year. \n \nThe naming and specs aren’t for certain until that September 29th event rolls around, but it seems pretty solid.
0924_dd83964f-25d0-4703-a3a9-0699a94f2808	Tsabong — The Apostolic Faith Mission church men's fellowship member for Tsabong branch, Atamelang Mmereki, says sports fellowship builts strong families, associations and general society whose moral is slowly decaying. Tsabong Apostolic Faith Mission church sports fellowship was formed in 2010 and has been used as a forum where the spirit of botho, could be instilled among the youth.\n\nThe primary purpose of the sports club according Mmereki is to teach married men the mannerism that could build strong homes.\n\nHe said the club also kept those actively involved mentally and physically sharp at all times.\n\n"Fitness in the church and the general public is an important element that cannot be ignored."\n\nHe said the church would continue on its mission to lure as many people as possible to the club. Mmereki expressed happiness saying positive outcomes were slowly coming to the fore as the club continued to attract scores of young men to the church.
0925_259ae48d-0428-4f8d-a451-0684e28429d8	GMC Sports Information \n  \nThe Georgia Military College Bulldogs fell to visiting College of DuPage at home on Saturday. \n \nIt was all DuPage to start out the game as they held Georgia Military College (GMC) to a 3-and-out and scored on their following drive on a 5-yard touchdown with 10:50 left in the first quarter to put DuPage on the board first 7-0. \n \nIt was more of the same as DuPage held GMC to another 3-and-out and scored on another rushing touchdown, this time for 56 yards to put them up 14-0. \n \nAfter a couple of stalled out drives for both teams, DuPage scored once again on another rush touchdown increasing the number to a 79-yard touchdown, putting them up 21-0. \n \nGMC finally got on the board with a field goal from Evan Pantels to put the score at 21-3. \n \nThe following drive DuPage converted for another rushing touchdown from 4 yards out after a big return to set up the score. \n \nAfter an interception thrown by GMC, DuPage scored on field goal and increased their lead to 31-3. \n \nTo start the second half GMC came out strong on defense holding DuPage to no points, but on the Bulldogs’ following offensive drive they threw an interception returned for a touchdown, putting the score at 39-3 after the 2-point conversion. \n \nGMC kept fighting as David Mims intercepted the DuPage pass with 1:13 left in the third quarter. \n \nThe Bulldogs closed the game out strong, playing good defense and stalling out a few DuPage drives, forcing a safety on a punt followed by a TD by Josh Nurse. \n \nDuPage ended the game with an interception and win with a final score of 39-12 in the opponent’s favor. \n \nGMC head coach Bert Williams had a few thoughts after the game. \n \n“It was certainly a disappointing day for us all. We would have loved to pick up a win, but we ran into a very good program in DuPage College. Not taking anything away from them, but we were a bit dead-legged with the short preparation week. We will now have an open week were we can get rested, regroup and work on our areas that need improvement. We trust that our young guys will take some lessons away from this and get better. There is a lot of football left and we will be ready to go on Oct. 3 when we line it up against a very good program in Nassau Community College (N.Y.).”
0926_7351f501-5b1f-4c2e-8093-efe3a98d5b8f	It’s better to burn out than fade away as old Neil Young observed from the safety of his thirties… yet how would you feel if you’d done both? Sixty years after her silent flame flickered so brightly did Louise Brooks spend her days in doubt and remorse?\nAs with politicians, actors’ careers often end in failure – a life measured by success, commercial and critical popularity, appreciation of your talent and your looks (although I think we’ve all got to contend with that…). Few had the visceral, visual impact of Louise Brooks nor the unique combination of intellect and beauty than enabled her to transcended the self-made mess of her Hollywood years to become an icon; her posters and postcards the gateway experience to a face that still compels attention and repeated viewing.\nAny excuse... Leslie Mildiner’s new play American Venus takes the title of one of Brooks’ (mostly) lost films to tell the tale of her life as she lives out her final days in the bedroom of her Rochester apartment.\nMildiner bravely takes on the task of recreating one of the most complex personalities in film and succeeds in presenting a version of Brooksie that rings true not just from a fans’ point of view but on a human level.\nThis is in large part down to a titanic performance of wit and integrity from Susan Penhaligon who fights against the dying of the light in her own way: denying her usefulness and importance, putting down her carers and long-suffering friends as she is slowly weakened by a combination of emphysema and a heart condition.\nSusan Penhaligon Penhaligon’s delivery is pitch perfect and out of every excruciating coughing fit she flies with stinging one-liners striking out at herself and those around her.\nShe has dreams of her past and relives the brief affair her younger self, played by the sparkling Angharad George-Carey with elfin energy, had with Charlie Chaplin in 1925 New York. Brooks was 18 at the time and a dancer in the Follies just about to embark on a movie contract with Warner Brothers. There’s no evidence that she thought Chaplin was “The One” but in the play their relationship is used to show the intensity of Louise’s character – her near limitless possibilities the near-equal of Chaplin’s own…\nAngharad George-Carey poses as young Louise Tim Walton (who I’d last seen in the excellent City of Angels at the Donmar) plays Chaplin as a charismatic, muscular intellectual who is fascinated by the young woman’s refusal to submit to his will. Chaplin has just become a father again but Louise is unimpressed, she is a self-sufficient unit who will make her own mistakes with no room for phony sentimentality.\nMildiner appears to suggest that a combination of harsh parenting and her sexual abuse aged nine, may have made Brooks the unyielding truth-sayer and performer she was – who knows? She certainly seemed capable of inspiring loyalty and was supported by financial contributions by an ex-lover for the last few decades of her life.\nMary Keegan Here she is cared for by Phylis (Mary Keegan who is also superb) who is stronger than anyone suspects, ignoring Louise’s art of misdirection and trying to do the best for her. One hopes that Brooksie did indeed have such a steadfast supporter.\nLouise rides Phylis hard but this seems to be part delusion and part thank you… Phylis’ husband Frank (Brian Deacon) is not as strong as the women and whilst he makes himself busy Louise always has something more for him to do.\nSusan Penhaligon and Nicholas Waring in rehearsal Louis has a friend Stan (Nicholas Waring) who collects her library books and brightens her day with his tales of romantic failure. He leads with his heart, something Brooksie would never do, and as a consequence is constantly disappointed by the men in his life. His latest lover is clearly only after his money and a green card… he leaves him in the end for a woman. Poor Stan, if only he had a tenth of Louise’s spirit.\nAnother visitor is the librarian Tara (Sophia Swannell) who arrives initially to complain about Louise’s annotating the books she borrows with corrections and other “helpful” observations (including one concerning Tyrone Power that I probably shouldn’t repeat in writing). She stands her ground and is accepted.\nSophia Swannell and Brian Deacon Louise is invited to be guest of honour at a retrospective screening of six films at Eastman House and has to be cajoled into going by Stan, she weeps at the sight of herself in Pandora’s Box… like being “present at her own autopsy…”\nDirected by Sarah Berger who makes splendid use of the limited space of Fred’s Place this was close-contact theatre with every emphysematic fit making the audience squirm. I have no idea how the performers can stay so focused mere feet away from their audience but if you want to see how actors really work this is the place to be.\nAngharad George-Carey and Tim Walton rehearse napping Louise’s passing was felt most pertinently by Phylis – I won’t give away exactly how – but her message of obstinacy in the face of incapacity is a call to all to be true to themselves and to treat the twin imposters of fame and failure just the same.\nDon’t waste it… and I’m pretty sure, Brooks, for all her trials, never really did. There are no doubts from Louise who’s only regret was growing old and hating it: if all you wanted to do was dance why love life when you can’t do what you love anymore?\nAmerican Venus is part of the Ever Hopefull Repertory Season of plays which completes at Fred's Place today… it deserves a wider audience and hopefully will get another airing. There's a short video about the season here.\n6 Frederick's Place, just round the corner from Bank station Keep an eye out for further events at No. 6, Fred’s Place and from the So and So Arts Club. It's the most intimate of venues in a side-street Georgian townhouse where Disreali lived in the 1820's and we almost felt like intruders as west end tales were passed around the room... a real treat!

0928_9e74613b-5d0f-479b-b981-c32f6e6a0f0f	James Ernette encouraged family members to get involved in the printing business he founded, and he mentored them along the way. \n\nAfter retiring, he helped his daughter, the company's new president, become certified through the Women's Business Enterprise National Council. \n\n“The paperwork had to be a foot high. We did it together,” said Lisa R. Frederick, president of Unity Printing Co. Inc. near Latrobe. \n\nJames L. “Jay” Ernette of Greensburg, Hutchinson Island, Fla., and Port St. Lucie, Fla., died unexpectedly Monday, Aug. 31, 2015, in Excela Health Latrobe Hospital. He was 70. \n\nHe was born July 18, 1945, in Greensburg, a son of the late William C. Ernette Sr. and Dorothy R. (Longsdorf) Ernette. \n\nHe graduated from Hempfield Area High School, Point Park College and the Pennsylvania State Police Academy. \n\nMr. Ernette was a state trooper for 20 years. After retiring, he continued to work in the printing business, “teaching by explaining,” said his son-in-law and company COO, Joe Frederick. \n\nMr. Ernette “stepped right in” when Frederick's father died to support him and his younger brother, he said. \n\nMr. Ernette was a member and officer of numerous Masonic organizations. In 1998, he was elected to serve a term as Right Worshipful Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. \n\nA highlight of his swearing-in ceremony included the use of a Bible once owned by Mason and Founding Father George Washington, his daughter said. \n\nShe recalled his determination to bring the Masonic Village at Sewickley to fruition. \n\n“He really wanted Western Pennsylvania to have an option,” she said. \n\nAn avid Steelers fan and season-ticket holder, Mr. Ernette saw promise in a team ball boy he got to know.

0929_f3552212-8dbe-4f29-9415-76d800052a84	Here comes the much-awaited month in the fashion magazine business: September. It's the month where every publishers around the globe brought the best in fashion for Fall/Winter collection. This year, the tradition is continued as far as the 'real estate' of the magazine is concerned - by which, what I meant is its thickness. I don't need to explain it anymore coz it's known that September issues always had that hefty weight they're carrying. If you don't get those biceps toned up while bringing those mags in your arms, then don't call it September issues! Unlike the previous years where I always joined the fashion bandwagon by getting myself a bulk of those September mags, in 2015 I somehow reduces the added weights by choosing just a couple of printed versions. Not only to save budget (which is probably the big reason during this economic downturn!), but also to save some spaces in my home library... coz apparently I'm having some issues for storing my reading materials. See, September issues, storage issue. The safe bet: going digital. And the best bet: free digital versions! These are some of the digital version I'm adding into my list for this year's September issues: Men's Health UK. For some reason this year, most upscale bookstore that I went to like Kinokuniya, Times Bookstore and Borders no longer carry this mag. I dunno what's the reason, but IMO Men's Health UK is the best Men's Health mag among all of its global franchise in existence. For this month, they went for Mr. Superman - Henry Cavill - to front the magazine. The fashion editorial to look for is the 'Green is Good' section, where they featured a selection of green-inspired thematic pieces in forest green, emerald, pea green and olive, from the jacket to accessories like bag and shoes, to even the gadget like headphones, bearing the color. Men's Health US, with Colin Farrell as the cover guy. As Fall fashion is concerned, the editorial spread to look for is the 'camping in the wood' theme - bearing the laid-back casual pieces that brought the lumberjack feel into a new level (nope, I'm not referring to that lumbersexual thing!) GQ US. I have one statement to say about this issue: HATE IT. There's nothing in this issue is inspiring. Fashion is very blah - I mean, totally lower than mediocre - and the choice of cover guy is totally wrong! Even if they're putting Joe Manganiello in one of the editorial spread, I can't comprehend the choice of fashion pieces they've selected. All wrong for a coveted issue. Eeek! Details. This issue could be a collector's item - that's why I had the print version as well. The front cover is what a front cover of a fashion mag should be - fronted by the male models. Not one, not two, but 31 male models du jour.  Either veteran models who made it in the industry for years, to the rising star to watch, this is definitely a great cover. Rivals that 2014 Vogue! GQ Australia. Honestly, I never took sight to this friend Down Under, but it seems that they're doing way better than its sibling out there in the States. Jam-packed with fashion pieces from the clothes to watches and bags galore, and not to mention the overflowing editorial spread - definitely, this is what GQ mag should be! (and a GQ September issue should be!) Oh, September issues are definitely for the ladies - hands down. I'll be taking some time to check those in the women's fashion soon. All on the digital version, like these lots. Some of you could be asking why should one read these mag? Well, for September issues... this is the answer [CLICK] September issue would not be the September issue without the mother of all September issues - which is none other than Vogue US. Continuing the tradition, the magazine is again as thick as the phonebook like before. Yet, it seems that the mag is reducing in number of pages, peaking when Lady Gaga took the cover in 2012, and declining as years go by. Is it a signal that economy is not doing well for Condé Nast? No comment.

0931_3ddfa461-a842-4255-a006-8ea82da1428b	A Conversation with Steven Romick, First Pacific Advisors, and David Herro, Harris Associates. \n \n[buffett] \n \nH/T Dataroma \n Steven Romick & David Herro: Bottom-Up Investing In A Macro World by Litman Gregory Analytics  \nWe recently hosted an investment panel with FPA's Steven Romick and Harris Associates' David Herro. Romick serves as portfolio manager of FPA Crescent Fund and the FPA Contrarian Value product. Herro has managed the Oakmark International, Oakmark International Small Cap, and Oakmark Global Select funds since inception. The conversation, moderated by Litman Gregory chief investment officer Jeremy DeGroot, centered on how these fundamental stock pickers are navigating today's investment environment. \n \nYou are both bottom-up investors, but we're operating in a world where macroeconomic events can impact and overwhelm industries and individual companies. And these are certainly interesting macro times, particularly when we have examples such as Greece in the headlines. How do you balance or incorporate specific macro risks given your very bottom-up focus? \n \nDavid Herro: Well, if you back up, a company operates in an environment in which it either has a very fertile environment where you have strong demand growth and you have euphoria—people are buying your goods or if you're a business-to-business, the capital spending boom is on—[or it may be operating in not a fertile environment]. \n \nA lot of this environment depends on what's happening in the macroeconomy and with macroeconomic policy. \n \nI think all too often, we ignore what's happening in microeconomics. If you look at Europe, the whole European crisis—in my view—is more micro-driven than macro. \n \nEurope cannot compete—same with Japan, by the way—because of structural inefficiencies. Not because of some macro. What you have is structural inefficiencies leading to macro disturbances, in a way. Having said all of that, remember we're pricing a business based on its cash flow stream. So if there's a macroeconomic slowdown, it will impact the company's earnings stream for maybe a quarter or two. Or even a year or two. \n \nBut wait a minute. The value of the business is just not a function of the next couple quarters' or the next couple years' free cash flow. The value of the business is all those cash flow streams discounted into perpetuity. \n \nI think the big mistake people make is trying to play these macro cycles. Yes, you have to be aware how the businesses you're invested in are impacted by changes in the levels of aggregate demand, etc. \n \nAnd you also have to be aware of how they're impacted by the local rules of which they're operating in around the world. So, macro certainly is the biggest event or influence that people like to think about, and I think it's completely wrong. People should be looking at the company's ability to grow profit streams. They should be looking at the risk factors to those profit streams of which macroeconomics is a very small factor, generally speaking. \n \nAgain, it's a small factor because it affects it over the short term. And if a company has a strong enough balance sheet, we can analyze their ability to withstand macro shocks. \n \nIf this is the case, then we could use macroeconomic volatility as our friend. And I think one of the best examples for us is, if you remember in late 2008, when we all knew the world was in a recession, and a very stiff one, but we kind of piled into consumer discretionary stocks. Not because we thought, well, the world's going to bounce back in a couple months. But because the price of those businesses dropped like 60% and 70% and 80%—far more than what were the “safe” consumer staples stocks. \n \nSo, what was the barometer? Price. We knew that the companies were going to be impacted by the business cycle. And a very strong business cycle. \n \nBut then you go through it and look for companies that have the balance sheets, the brands, the capital position, the unique selling propositions that could withstand the weakness. Enabling us [to determine] that when the storm leaves, the stocks aren't [going to be] up 20% or 30%; but up 70% or 80%. \n \nSo, we like to look through the cycle and use the volatility of the macro economy to position the portfolio to the degree at which we could populate that portfolio with companies with the most economic upside. \n \nSteven Romick: You imposed the question by saying, “macro.” David had interpreted it to be macroeconomics. I'll just give it a little bit of a different spin. So I'll just call it macro-big-picture. \n \nSo I'll just put the question to all of you. Right? \n \nWe've never seen rates this low in our lifetimes. The perversion in asset prices that we've seen out there as a result of low interest rates is affecting many different parts of the world. And it's lifted all asset prices. \n \nSo a very, very smart friend of mine said very simplistically, “Look. So goes the 10-year, so goes the market.” Now obviously, again, it's a fairly trite view. But, it does beg the question, what happens to rates? \n \nAnd I, by the way, don't have a view. I'm not going to call it on the rates or direction or the timing or the magnitude. Anything like that. \n \nI tend not to engage in that. I do come back down to whether or not the business we buy is a good business and if it can operate successfully through whatever is coming our way. \n \nI do feel that [investors feel] a need to be invested because there is a lack of opportunity elsewhere. This has tended to lift prices to a level where we don't see the risk-rewards for our portfolio. \n \nWe have cash in our portfolio as a result. A lot of it. It's a byproduct, though, of the underlying [bottom-up] analysis of these businesses we're investing in or looking to invest in. \n \nSo, if we see something that meets our risk-reward, we'll buy it. I don't care about the environment. \n \nWe had 40% of the portfolio going into cash going into 2008. Then we just were buying distressed debt hand-over-fist in 2008 and 2009. I mean we were on the precipice of a depression. Now, I didn't know what was going to happen. Obviously, a depression didn't hit. But I didn't know how it was going to come out. \n \n  \n \nSee full article here . \n \nSteven Romick \n \nThe post Steven Romick: Bottom-Up Investing In A Macro World appeared first on ValueWalk . \n Like this article?

0932_f115db03-0dd2-4ad3-af66-4740c6aafddb	(Reuters) - The Kentucky clerk's office that had refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples in defiance of orders by a federal judge on Friday morning began the process of ending that resistance. While Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis was jailed on Thursday for refusing to follow the orders of U.S. District Judge David Bunning, her deputies began processing a license for James Yates and William Smith, who had previously been denied in the quest for a marriage license on Friday.
0933_3e3cee50-753a-45be-8b5e-992ae4c838e6	Move over, Boomers. You may have more money (for now), but Millennials have more people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Millennials now represent more than one-quarter of the nation’s population with 83.1 million people, compared to 75.4 million Boomers. And in a short time, Millennials will be the generation with the most financial pull. Source: Money Matters: How Affluent Millennials Are Living the Millennial Dream, The FutureCast That being said, how do brands attract this ever-so-illusive generation? Easy. Understand their wants and needs, and make their lives easier by solving an everyday problem. Some people say Millennials feel entitled, but there’s definitely more than what meets the eye. For example, Millennials… have strong brand loyalty. desire quick, but accurate results. have high expectations. are passionate about civic causes.  are plugged in and highly engaged on social media. Here are a couple of brands that are doing it right: Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay Who doesn’t love a pumpkin spice latte on a cool fall day? Okay, maybe that’s just me. But what happens when you’re in a hurry to make it to work on time and can’t afford to sit in the drive-through for 20 minutes? You order ahead, obviously. And with Starbucks’ mobile app, you can have your favorite beverage or snack waiting for you. With no added cost, it’s a no-brainer. Blue Apron Now that we’re living on our own, we’re faced with a new challenge. Cooking. We grew up loving mom’s home-cooked favorites, but we don't have the time (or, frankly, skills) to whip up pan-seared scallops with mushroom risotto from scratch. That’s where Blue Apron hit a home run. They deliver original recipes weekly, with pre-portioned fresh ingredients, straight to your door. So easy, my husband could do it.  If you’re hung up on where to start, there are three marketing objectives you should focus on right away to attract this demographic: Be authentic and genuine Keep it simple and effective Solve a problem Let me know: What other consumer-facing brands do you engage with because of their ability to accomplish these three goals?
0934_12482e90-c11e-431a-ae68-2540cbcf0922	I've been in Marrakech for a few days now.\nIt's probably my second favorite city in Morocco. There is part of it that is almost like any big modern cities, but part of it that is very Moroccan. My favorite part of the city is probably joining the crowd at the main square where there are tons of food stalls, shopping, drummers, dancers, monkey acrobats, snake charmers, fortune tellers, jugglers, old medicine men, etc.\nIt's actually my last day in Morocco today. On my first day here, I walked passed a coffee place with only men sitting outside facing the street...it was intimidating. As a woman, I wondered if I was allowed to go in. If you do go in, men will stare at you as if you've done something wrong. It's still a men's world here...but I've met Rachida, a very independent woman...she taught me a lot about Moroccan culture. There are women who push and fight, women who drive cars, women in parliament, polygamous marriages are almost completely abolished and you're actually allowed to wear short shorts and spaghetti straps in bigger cities (unlike other middle eastern countries). A few years ago, women only went outside twice in their lifetime; on her wedding and on the day she dies. Now, if a man tells a woman to go back home, other women will stand up for her and tell the man to mind his own business.\nA lot of things we have in western countries is taken for granted, but we have to remember it's because there were women who fought for us to have those rights. It's such a young country...the older ones resists changes, but try to tell a younger one how it's done and he does exactly the opposite. It's a fascinating country here, and you feel the evolution when you're travelling from the country side to the bigger cities. It was a great lesson.\nTo be honest, the hot weather really isn't for me, and I've been sick the past few days...but I will miss desert, the medinas, the mountains and the people!
0935_b12f0805-57dc-47ce-adbe-a7f09ec4fcbb	The latest developments as Russia and other nations counter Islamic State militants in Syria. All times local: \n\n9:05 p.m. \n\nIraq's prime minister is clarifying that his country's cooperation with Russia, Syria and Iran is for intelligence only and not a military cooperation. \n\nThe office of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi posted a statement on his official Facebook page saying that "Iraq has not agreed to establish a military coordination cell with the said countries, and any claim to the contrary is false." \n\nThe statement was issued hours after Russia announced its airstrikes in Syria and said the strikes were targeting the Islamic State group. \n\nRussia, Syria, Iran and Iraq startled the United States on Sunday when Iraq's military said the countries will begin sharing "security and intelligence" information to help combat the Islamic State group. \n\nEarlier Wednesday, Syrian state TV quoted the country's foreign minister as praising a new mechanism for coordination between the countries to combat terrorism. \n\n--- \n\n8:40 p.m. \n\nA moderate Western-backed Syrian rebel group says one of its leading officers has been killed in the Russian airstrikes in Syria's central Homs province. \n\nThe group said on its website Wednesday that Iyad al-Deek died in an airstrike in the rural north of Homs. Al-Deek was an officer in the Syrian army but defected soon after the Syrian revolution turned into a war in 2011. \n\nThe group didn't provide any more details. \n\nActivists and a rebel commander in Syria earlier Wednesday claimed the Russian airstrikes in the country have mostly hit moderate rebel positions and civilians. Russian officials have dismissed such claims. \n\n--- \n\n8:25 p.m. \n\nGermany's foreign minister says Russia's airstrikes in Syria don't diminish his concerns about the situation in the country and is calling for more information on the attacks. \n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier said on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York that there's no authoritative information yet on "the targets and methods of these airstrikes." He added that "Russia must have an interest of its own in ensuring that this is cleared up as quickly as possible." \n\nSteinmeier said that "in this heated situation, there is a great danger that there could be further misunderstandings." \n\nHe noted that his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov has said all must ensure that international efforts to fight the Islamic State group are coordinated, and said: "this also goes for Russian activities." \n\nSteinmeier insisted that there ultimately will be no military solution to Syria's conflict. \n\n--- \n\n8:20 p.m. \n\nSyria's foreign minister says his country strongly endorses "the initiative of President Putin" and is calling French and other airstrikes in Syria that aren't coordinated with his government a "blatant contravention" of international law. \n\nWalid al-Moallem spoke to the U.N. Security Council shortly after Russia announced its own airstrikes and circulated to council members a draft resolution aimed at coordinating global efforts in the fight against terror. \n\n"Those who really do want to fight terrorism in Syria need to cooperate their work with the government in Syria," al-Moallem told the council, and he urged everyone to follow Russia's call. \n\nHe also questioned what the council has done to fight terrorism. Russia's use of its veto has blocked several proposals on Syria. \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States is prepared to welcome Russian military action in Syria as long as it is directed against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida affiliates. \n\nSpeaking at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, Kerry said that the U.S. would have "grave concerns" if Russia conducted strikes against other groups. And, he said Russian operations must not support Syrian President Bashar Assad or interfere with those of the U.S.-led coalition that is already attacking Islamic States targets. \n\nKerry spoke as Russia launched its first airstrikes in Syria targeting what it said were Islamic State positions. U.S. officials and others cast doubt on that claim, saying the Russians appeared to be attacking opposition groups fighting Syrian government forces. \n\n--- \n\n8:10 p.m. \n\nSyrian state TV is quoting the country's foreign minister as praising a new mechanism for coordination between Damascus, Russia, Iran and Iraq to combat terrorism. \n\nWalid al-Moallem was quoted by state TV Wednesday as discussing the new mechanism with his Iraqi counterpart at the sidelines of a United Nations' meetings in New York. \n\nIraq had previously said it will begin sharing intelligence with Syria, Russia and Iran to help combat the Islamic State group. \n\nAl-Moallem said the new mechanism provides a way for the four countries to coordinate their fight against terrorism. \n\n--- \n\n8:00 p.m. \n\nU.S. Senate Republicans are denouncing Russia's actions in Syria. \n\nSenator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the airstrikes "pretty incredible" and criticized President Barack Obama's administration for not taking a stronger stance against Russia. \n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that initial reports are that Russian pilots were hitting targets not controlled by IS. \n\nHe said some strikes were near the city of Homs, which the militants do not control, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin's true intentions are to maintain a strong position in Syria and support Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n\nHe also criticized Obama for saying that the U.S. is willing to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the Syrian conflict. \n\n--- \n\n7:55 p.m. \n\nBritain's foreign minister says his country welcomes Russia's new "focus" on using force against the Islamic State group in Syria, but warns it's "very important that Russia be able to confirm that military action it has undertaken this morning" doesn't target Syria's moderate opposition. \n\nPhilip Hammond told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that actions in support of Syria's government are incompatible with the fight against terrorism. \n\nHammond said the international community will expect Russia to use the growing influence it has in Syria to pressure Syria's government not to use barrel bombs against civilians and to prevent any use of chemicals as weapons. \n\n--- \n\n7:40 p.m. \n\nFrance's Foreign Minister says "initial indications" show Russian airstrikes in Syria didn't target zones controlled by the Islamic State group, and said if confirmed this runs counter to a condition France has set on agreeing to join a Russian coalition against the extremists. \n\nLaurent Fabius says "verification is underway" to determine what the Russian strikes targeted, but that it currently appears they may have targeted zones held by Syrian opposition forces, who Russia considers terrorists seeking to overthrow its long-time ally Bashar Assad. \n\nFabius said France is not against the Russian proposal of an anti-IS coalition, but on three conditions: that strikes only target IS, that the Syrian regime end barrel bombing of civilian populations, and that negotiations for a political solution resume, with the understanding that Assad cannot be a part of the solution. \n\n--- \n\n7:35 p.m. \n\nA prominent member of Russia's parliament has suggested that Russia could strike beyond Syria if the extremists targeted by its airstrikes flee across the border. \n\n"When you poison an insect it's not enough to send it into the neighbors' kitchen," said Konstantin Kosachyov, who chairs the international affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house. "This would make our efforts to counter terrorism meaningless." \n\nKosachyov noted that President Vladimir Putin's request for authorization to use military force abroad did not specify the country, adding that this was intentional. \n\n--- \n\n7:30 p.m. \n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has told Russia's LifeNews TV station that reports of civilian casualties from the Russian airstrikes in Syria are part of an "information war." \n\nShe said "all this is the same sort of information attack, the same sort of information war, of which we hear so many times and which, it appears, someone prepared well." \n\nActivists and a rebel commander in Syria earlier Wednesday claimed the Russian airstrikes in the country have mostly hit moderate rebel positions and civilians. \n\n--- \n\n7:20 p.m. \n\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the use of Russian military force in Syria adds a "troubling" new development to the war in Syria and throws Assad a "life line." \n\nHe said it could be more destabilizing than Turkey's effort to combat the Kurds. \n\n"The Russian air campaign may be even more destructive if it targets moderate rebel forces fighting the Assad regime," Schiff said. \n\n"The increased longevity of the regime - made possible by this Russian intervention - will only prolong the civil war, which will continue as long as a regime that barrel bombs its own people remains in power," he said. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nThe U.S. conducted airstrikes in Syria as planned Wednesday including one near Aleppo, which is in the northwest but not near where the Russians were flying, a U.S. official said. \n\nThe official said the Russian officer who notified the U.S. of the strikes said the U.S. should stay out of Syrian airspace and remove any troops it has on the ground working with rebels in Syria. \n\nThe U.S. has repeatedly said it has no U.S. military forces on the ground in Syria. \n\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the missions publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\n—By Lolita Baldor and Robert Burns in Washington \n\n--- \n\n7:00 p.m. \n\nActivists and a rebel commander in Syria claim the Russian airstrikes in the country have mostly hit moderate rebel positions and civilians. \n\nIn a video released by the U.S.-backed rebel group Tajamu Alezzah, jets are seen hitting a building claimed to be a location of the group in the town of Latamna in the central Hama province. \n\nThe group commander Jameel al-Saleh told a local Syrian news website that the group's location was hit by Russian jets but didn't specify the damage. \n\nA group of local activists in the town of Talbiseh in Homs province recorded at least 16 civilians killed, including two children. A Syrian military official had earlier said the Russian jets hit this town. \n\nThe AP could not independently verify the claims. \n\n--- \n\n6:25 p.m. \n\nFormer CIA director, Gen. David Petraeus, has said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin's immediate objective in Syria is to solidify the corridor on the Mediterranean coast between Latakia where he has an air base and Tartus where he has a Russian naval base. \n\nAs he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, Petraeus said Putin also wants to help Syrian President Bashar Assad solidify his grip on the country, which has been increasingly challenged in recent months by the Islamic State and other opposition groups. \n\nPetraeus warned against partnering with Russia, Iran and Assad against IS and said the U.S. should deter any action by Russia involving any of the forces backed by the U.S. \n\n"If Russia wanted to fight ISIS, they could have joined the 60-plus member coalition that Gen. Allen has so capably put together and help drop bombs on ISIS. They have some capabilities that would be useful to that fight so this is clearly not what they're up to," he said. \n\n--- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein says she thinks it's possible that Russia's move in Syria could be a positive development. \n\nFeinstein, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said help from "Russia and Iran in a political solution for Syria is important." \n\nFeinstein said the key is to defeat the Islamic State group and then to hold an election in Syria, and that the U.S. should cooperate with Russia. \n\nShe said it was important to "change the dynamic" because IS continues to encroach on other states. \n\n--- \n\n6:05 p.m. \n\nA senior U.S. official says Russia's airstrikes in Syria did not appear to be targeting the Islamic State group, but other opposition groups fighting against Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n\nThe official said IS militants are not in the western part of the country, beyond Homs, where the Russian strikes were directed. \n\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the Russian airstrikes publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\nRussia notified the U.S. about the impending airstrikes through the embassy in Baghdad about an hour before they started, the official said. \n\nAccording to the official, there were no conflicts with the Russian strikes, and they had no impact on the coalition missions, which are primarily in the north and east. \n\nThe U.S. is still trying to assess the damages of the Russian strikes. \n\n—By Lolita C. Baldor and Robert Burn in Washington. \n\n--- \n\n5:50 p.m. \n\nA U.S.-backed Syrian rebel group has claimed that Russian warplanes have hit its positions in central Syria. \n\nThe group, known as Tajamu Alezzah, wrote scornfully on Twitter Wednesday that "eradicating terrorism appears to begin with attacks" on its locations in the central city of Latamna in the province of Hama. \n\nThe group, which boasts of having TOW missiles, didn't provide specific details on the targets or how it can ascertain the strikes were by Russian jets. \n\nWashington has equipped and trained a number of moderate Syrian rebel groups but most have been crushed by al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nRussia's foreign minister is telling the foreign ministers of world powers that his country is "ready to forge standing channels of communication to ensure a maximally effective fight against terrorist groups" with the United States and other countries. \n\nSergey Lavrov spoke Wednesday to the U.N. Security Council shortly after Russia's defense ministry announced its jets are carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State group positions in Syria. \n\nLavrov said Russia would shortly circulate a draft council resolution to promote joint efforts against groups like the Islamic State. \n\nLavrov addressed the council during a major U.N. gathering of world leaders. Russia is chairing the meeting as the council president this month. \n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also is expected to address the meeting. \n\n--- \n\n5:35 p.m. \n\nA Syrian military official says Russian warplanes have targeted positions of the Islamic State group in central Syria. \n\nSyrian state TV quotes an unnamed military official as saying that the air raids are part of the "Russian-Syrian agreement to fight international terrorism and wipe out the Daesh organization." \n\nThe official used an Arabic acronym to refer to the Islamic State group. \n\nThe official said on Wednesday that the air raids targeted the extremists' positions in central Syria including the areas of Rastan and Talbiseh, as well as areas near the town of Salamiyeh in Hama province. \n\nThe official said the Russian airstrikes were in cooperation with the Syrian air force. \n\n--- \n\n5:00 p.m. \n\nPentagon's press secretary says Defense Secretary Ash Carter has instructed his staff to talk to Russian officials about how to keep each other's air operations in Syria from colliding or getting in each other's way. \n\nPeter Cook said it was not yet clear when these talks would start or who would participate. \n\nRussia's defense ministry earlier Tuesday said its jets have started carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State group positions in Syria. \n\nA U.S. led coalition has been targeting IS militants in Syria and Iraq since last year. \n\nRussia and the U.S. are at odds over the Russian involvement because Washington has said Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is a key ally of Moscow, must be removed from power. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRussia's defense ministry says its jets are carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State positions in Syria. \n\nThe ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told Russian news agencies on Wednesday that Russian jets are carrying out targeted airstrikes on the positions, vehicles and warehouses that Russia believes belong to IS militants. \n\nEarlier Wednesday, Russia's upper chamber of parliament gave the green light to President Vladimir Putin's request to use Russian forces in Syria. A Kremlin official said the move was to protect Russia's national security, since at least 2,400 Russians have gone to fight in Syria or Iraq. \n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad is a key ally of Moscow.

He had an impenetrable Marseille accent and a liking for red bow ties and braces and oversized rings. Gerald Ford teased him about his size, asking in jest if he played American football. \n\nGeorges De Paris at work in 2002  Photo: AFP \n\nReflecting on his famous clients, De Paris recalled that Ronald Reagan was particularly charming, and knew his cloth: “[He] spoke a lot. He, like George W, knew how to appreciate the quality of fabrics. He gave me jelly beans and was always afraid that I would prick him with my needles during the fitting.” \n\nGeorge de Paris was born in Marseille in 1934 (his exact date of birth is unknown). In the late-1950s he left France for America, spurred on by a love affair with an American woman, arriving with his life savings of $4,000. He moved in with his girlfriend but when De Paris would not marry her he was sent on his way. He spent several months on the streets of Washington, sleeping in a park within sight of the White House. \n\nAfter getting a job as a cutter for a French-Canadian tailor he saved enough to buy a sewing machine and later to set up his own shop. He became an American citizen in 1969. \n\nDe Paris hit the big time in 1963 when he made a suit for Lyndon Johnson. “Congressman Otto Passman introduced him to me,” De Paris recalled. “This guy’s a good tailor, but he no speak English”. A tradition was born, although it was never an official role. \n\nGeorges de Paris with George W Bush \n\n“Each president has got a different charisma,” De Paris observed. “I tell them, wear something that fits your personality.” During fittings – watched over by Secret Service agents – Nixon was cordial and Carter quiet. De Paris found the “friendliest and also the most elegant” of his presidential customers to be George W Bush and Reagan – the latter was wearing one of his suits when he was shot by John Hinckley in 1981. Although George Bush Snr was “not the most agreeable” it was Bill Clinton who most irritated De Paris: he was “very demanding, cold and always occupied”. One feature united them: “Presidents all prefer dark colours.” \n\nHis other clients included Kofi Annan and Michael Bloomberg. In 2010 De Paris told Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF chief, who was then being touted as a future French president but who was later disgraced, that “if you wear my suit, you’ll win the election”. \n\nFond of cheese and wine, De Paris would often end the day at the Old Ebbitt Grill, Washington’s oldest restaurant. During his time in presidential circles he always focused on the task at hand. “I want to stay away from the politics,” De Paris said. “I want to be a tailor.” \n\nHe never married. \n\nGeorges de Paris, born 1934, died 13 September 13 2
0937_2841ea9b-9e7a-4d40-b55c-7745035dfdf8	A billionaire politician under investigation for corruption in Malaysia faces allegations his family companies have laundered millions of dollars through the Australian real estate market. A billionaire politician under investigation for corruption in Malaysia faces allegations his family companies have laundered millions of dollars through the Australian real estate market. The allegations against the family of Sarawak governor Taib Mahmud are contained in a report, obtained by Fairfax Media, by an anti-corruption organisation in Switzerland concerned with logging of rainforests in Borneo and displacement of its indigenous people.\n\nIn its report, "The Adelaide Hilton Case – how a Malaysian politician's family laundered $30 million in South Australia", the Bruno Manser Fund (a Swiss non-government organisation) exposes the corporate connections behind Taib's company Sitehost, which owns Adelaide's $50 million Hilton Hotel.\n\nMajor hotels chains like Hilton normally manage and lend their name to properties that are owned by other parties.\n\nTaib Mahmud was a Colombo Plan graduate of University of Adelaide and a substantial benefactor to his old alma mater. He was given an honorary doctorate and had a part of the campus named after him. The University has refused to say how much money it has received from Taib despite although a spokesman said not donations were received in the last eight years. Malaysian investigation\n\nThe Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) announcing in June 2011 that the billionaire politician was under investigation for corruption.\n\nUnder Taib's governorship, nearly 90 per cent of Sarawak's native rainforests have been logged. Despite his modest income as a politician, the family of Taib Mahmud has interests in more than 400 companies in 25 countries.\n\nThe report questions how the Taib family could afford to finance the purchase of this major hotel and also a key loan in the deal which together totalled some $30 million in the early 1990s.\n\nTaib's daughter and son-in-law became shareholders of an Australian company, Sitehost, after the family bought shares worth $9.5 million in 1993.\n\nThe report says that when Sitehost acquired the Hilton hotel the following year, it took an unsecured loan of $20.75 million "from a non-bank lender whose identity remained undisclosed for over ten years". Queensland move\n\nSitehost revealed in 2007 that the lender was Victorian company Golborne Pty Ltd. The report tracks how that loan was then transferred to another company, Fordland, located in Queensland.\n\nThe last available financial accounts for Sitehost are from 2011 and show its main liability was a loan of $18.5 million to Fordland.\n\nThe accounts describe a company with 361 employees, revenue of $1.3 million and assets of $52 million (primarily the Hilton).\n\nAccording to the report, there is strong circumstantial evidence, including a shadow structure on the Isle of Man, that Golborne Australia and Fordland Australia represented the same beneficial owners: the Taib family. Late accounts\n\nOfficial records are lacking. As a large proprietary company, Sitehost is required to file annual financial statements with The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\nIts latest annual accounts however were filed in 2013 for the 2011 financial year. There were no accounts filed from the 1998 to 2006. Ernst & Young are the auditors and National Australia the banker.\n\nASIC declined to say whether it had taken or intended to take any action in regards of the breaches.\n\n"We can't comment on the specifics of your query and any allegations about money laundering should be directed to AUSTRAC as it is Australia's anti-money laundering regulator," said a spokesman\n\n"ASIC is one of a number of agencies, including AUSTRAC, that forms the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. This taskforce was set up to address the threat that serious financial crime poses to the integrity of Australia's financial and regulatory systems."\n\nAccording to its most recent filings, Sitehost's directors are Jamilah Taib (Taib Mahmud's daughter), her Canadian husband Sean Murray – who lives in the second most expensive private residence in Ottowa - and two Australian lawyers, Gary Patrick Doherty and John Antoine Kiosoglous.\n\nContacted by Fairfax Media, Gary Doherty said he did not know the source of the funds behind Golborne or Fordland. 'Conceal', but no subterfuge\n\nDoherty is a partner at the Sydney law firm Low Doherty & Stratford and a director of property development companies, one of which bears the name "Conceal Pty Ltd".\n\nDoherty said there was "no subterfuge" in the name Conceal.\n\n"When you used to buy shelf companies they were always running out of names. The name was just a word that was there," he said.\n\nThe other local director of Sitehost, John Kiosoglous, was unavailable for comment. Questions were put to him via a third party.\n\nDoherty said he was aware of the money laundering allegations but had no involvement in money laundering. Nor did he know the source of the funds from Golborne or Fordland.\n\nThere is no allegation that either director has been involved in money laundering. Swapping Guernsey\n\nBesides the Taib family, with a 95 per cent holding, the other shareholder in Sitehost is a Guernsey company, not a British Virgin Islands company as disclosed to ASIC.\n\n"By indicating that Astar (this other shareholder with five per cent) is a Guernsey rather than a BVI company, Sitehost's official shareholder information is clearly misleading and likely in breach of ASIC regulations. This might be interpreted as an attempt to conceal the real ownership of Sitehost," says the report.\n\nBruno Manser is calling on Australian authorities to investigate the Taib family interests, as the fund has already done in Canada and the UK. A representative Lukas Straumann has scheduled a press conference for 9.30am Wednesday at the Adelaide Hilton.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, South Australian MP Mark Parnell read out a motion in parliament expressing concern at the destruction of Malaysian rainforests and the connections between the Taib family, University of Adelaide and the Adelaide Hilton.\n\nHe called on the South Australian to investigate the allegations. The motion is expected to be filed on Wednesday. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
0938_8b1af6c6-4674-45a0-b806-1ec9bb6a2336	Labor’s role in Abbott’s policy shift should not be overlooked. \n       Tiny Abbot's Bittersweet refugee symphony  \nAustralia's decision to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees and begin air strikes on Islamic State target is a bittersweet mix. Rocco Fazzari and Denis Carnahan with apologies to The Verve (n Mick n Keith). \n PT1M12S   620  349    \nRemember when the prestige of governing was considered good for a percentage point or two, all other things being equal? The presumed advantage of incumbency. But now? \n\nIn the era of uncommitted voters and instant communication, competitors for office live from issue to issue. It can be brutal. Yet within that volatility, there is one advantage of power that oppositions still do not enjoy: being there. Distinct from prestige, "being there" is the singular responsibility falling to governments to respond to events and the opportunity therein to get their responses right. \n  \nBy promising to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees  … [Abbott] … had perhaps for the first time in his troubled prime ministership, eschewed his normal reflex to view things as simple left-right binaries, opting for unity rather than division.   \n  \nBefore this week, Tony Abbott had almost never done this, and it shows in his figures. Monday marked his two-year anniversary as Prime Minister. Newspoll that morning (kindly brought forward from its customary Tuesday release) showed the Coalition still 8 points off Labor on 46-54. That's 30 Newspolls now without a single government lead. When Fairfax-Ipsos and other regular polls are added in, Abbott's dud run nudges 180. \n \n Illustration: Simon Letch \n  \nCrucially, Newspoll's latest survey also showed him trailing Bill Shorten as better prime minister and that the Coalition had gone backwards, not forwards, on every indicator measured on election in 2013. Party room chatter about replacing the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey immediately ticked up. Despair deepened. \n \nYet a week that began so miserably ended on something of a high. The reasons were surprising: an escalating international humanitarian crisis, an emboldened Labor Party, an upwelling of pro-refugee Liberals, and an unlikely press conference on Wednesday which cast Abbott in a new and unfamiliar role: that of Prime Minister of Australia. \n\nWhen Abbott confounded critics by promising to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey, everything changed. \n\nFlanked by his foreign affairs and defence ministers, Julie Bishop and Kevin Andrews respectively, and the Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin, the PM's demeanour was uncommonly forward and inclusive. He had not only stared down a noisy chorus of divisive lightweights in his party room – dubbed the knuckle-draggers – he had perhaps for the first time in his troubled prime ministership, eschewed his normal reflex to view things as simple left-right binaries, opting for unity rather than division. In short, he had taken a step towards the middle point of politics, towards Labor. \n\nIt was a big moment for the Abbott operation which has too often resembled a combat unit than a national government. Here, on the incendiary issue of asylum seekers of all things, Abbott had demonstrated to his trenchant critics in the party room, that he could change, could learn, and was capable of hearing the mainstream over the strident ravings of favoured shock jocks. \n\nLabor's role in Abbott's policy shift, should not be overlooked either. Considering the electoral damage it had sustained over its disastrous boats policy while in office, the fact that Shorten, his deputy Tanya Plibersek, and his immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, felt inclined to strike out boldly on Monday calling for $100 million of new aid, and a 10,000 place immediate intake of Syrians, is significant. \n\nAs one Labor insider noted, Abbott's announcement was a function of how far the centre point of refugee policy has moved in recent months. "It was the first time the Coalition has come towards us in the immigration/asylum seeker policy space, probably since the Tampa crisis in 2001 when the consensus collapsed," he said. \n\nTwo things emboldened Labor's call. The first was its national conference decision in July, driven by Marles, to drop its contemptuous opposition and instead embrace the full suite of government policies directed against people smuggling – including turn-backs if needed. \n\nThat shift, impossible for many in the party's left to swallow, was tactically wise but more importantly, it was morally correct. Its dividend is already apparent in a more compassionate policy overall. The proof is the extent to which Shorten was able to get back on the front foot on refugees and to advocate the expansion of the orderly resettlement of displaced persons – both through Labor's proposed permanent doubling to 27,000, and though the one-off 10,000-place Syrian increase. Its importance in the broader political contest, cannot be overstated either because in consigning the chaos, anxiety, and maritime deaths of unregulated boat arrivals to the past, it has neutralised one of Abbott's most valuable lines of attack. \n\nThe second game changer was the public intervention of progressive Liberals such as NSW Premier Mike Baird and federal MPs like Craig Laundy and Russell Broadbent, following worldwide revulsion at pictures of a drowned Syrian toddler on a Turkish beach. \n\nThe net result of these factors also weighed on Abbott who for a change, decided not to go to the mattresses when faced with party room opposition – as he had on climate change and same-sex marriage. That he did not is even more surprising given that as recently as Sunday he had clearly stipulated that any Syrian intake would be handled within the existing humanitarian program capped at 13,750 places a year. \n\nA final notable factor in Abbott's rapid "journey", was the observance of proper decision-making processes. That began with dispatching Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to Europe to discuss Australia's response, and followed with two cabinet meetings, a meeting of the national security committee, and three party room meetings. \n\nOf course, whether Abbott's brains trust has learned from its excursion into building national unity, remains to be seen. \n\nMark Kenny is Fairfax Media's chief political correspondent.
0939_cef20b88-aeb4-400e-a122-471b0282b12c	(BPT) - Jack Whelan never missed his daily power walk. But at 58, he began to lose pace and grew concerned. Were his headaches and occasional nosebleeds normal signs of age, or were they something else? \n  \nIn 2006, after discussing his symptoms with his doctor, Whelan was diagnosed with a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. After reviewing treatment options, Whelan made the decision to explore participating in a clinical trial. \n \nTaking part in clinical trials helps doctors and scientists better understand how cancer cells respond to different treatments, what characteristics to look for to diagnose cancer sooner and how certain cancers might be prevented. Clinical trials can also offer the chance for patients to receive investigational treatments that might offer some improvement over standard treatment. \n \nOver the past nine years, Whelan has participated in seven clinical trials to treat his disease, and encourages other people with cancer to take an active role in exploring treatment options, including clinical trials. \n \n“I warn other people with cancer against taking a ‘car-wash’ approach, or passively accepting whatever is advised,” Whelan says. “I understand that not every person will make the same decision to participate in multiple trials, but it’s important to get a second opinion, be proactive about your care and explore all your options.” \n \nAccording to research from the Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation, many people who are aware of cancer clinical trials are hesitant to participate due to common misconceptions. For example, some fear they won’t receive quality care in a trial setting. Others are hesitant to join a trial because they think they might be in a study group that receives no treatment at all. Further, many people lack information about clinical trials available for their specific type of cancer. In fact, in one survey of people with cancer published in the Journal of Community and Supportive Oncology, only 16 percent were aware of trials relevant to their disease, and 65 percent noted this lack of awareness as the chief barrier to their participation in a study. Low awareness and participation is a major reason why less than half of all clinical trials achieve minimal enrollment, delaying important new studies to test potential new medicines and treatment approaches. \n \nWhelan was aware of clinical trials and engaged his doctor in a discussion about multiple treatment approaches. Today, he is focusing on spending time with his wife and six grandchildren. \n \n“Some people think that clinical trials are a last resort, but this does not have to be the case,” Whelan says. “Cancer is a nasty, nasty thing to have, but I just have this confidence that science is going to help me get through this.” \n \nFor more information about cancer clinical trials, including information on some of the common misconceptions and ways to discuss cancer clinical trials with your doctors and loved ones, visit ACT (About Clinical Trials) at www.LearnAboutClinicalTrials.org . There you will find helpful videos and perspectives from experts from the medical community, more stories from people like Whelan, who have participated in clinical trials. ACT was created by Genentech and the American Cancer Society to help people learn more about clinical trials and access informative resources to help them make educated decisions about their treatment. ACT is available to everyone and requires no enrollment or registration. \n \nClinical trials: Common concerns vs. truths \n \n* Will I be an experiment? Cancer clinical trials are developed with the highest medical and ethical standards, and participants are consistently treated with care and respect. \n \n* Will I receive a placebo? Cancer clinical trials rarely use a placebo alone if an effective treatment is available. \n \n* Is this my last resort? Trials can study everything from prevention to early- and late-stage treatment, and may be an option at any point after your diagnosis. \n \n* Will I receive quality care? Many procedures are in place to help you receive quality care throughout your experience.
0940_f49af9ca-609a-4bdf-baf8-d8ddd6dd4628	, EDT. OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso - Burkina Faso is freezing the assets of the leaders of the coup launched earlier this month, the state prosecutor said Saturday. An investigation will determine who will stand trial for the short-lived rebellion, the prime minister announced earlier.\n\nAssets will be frozen for three months for 14 individuals, including coup leader Gen. Gilbert Diendere and his wife Fatou Diendere, a parliamentary member of the former ruling party, Laurent Poda said in a statement released Saturday. They will be restricted to withdrawals of 300,000 CFA ($512) each month, he said. The assets of three political parties have also been frozen, he said.\n\nThe elite presidential guard arrested Interim President Michel Kafando and Prime Minister Yacouba Isaac Zida on Sept. 16. Diendere then took power, but stepped down after pressure from the West African regional bloc, Burkina Faso's military and demonstrating citizens. Kafando and Zida were reinstalled as the transitional government on Wednesday.\n\nZida said Friday a 30-day investigation will be launched into the coup. Those found to have played significant roles will go to court, he said. The others will be reintegrated into the army.\n\nKafando on Friday signed a decree to disband the presidential guard. He also fired its commander and the country's security minister, according to the edict announced on national television.\n\nBurkina Faso's armed forces said that they started disarming the presidential guard Friday. The elite force of about 1,300 was formed by former President Blaise Compaore, who was ousted in October. Its members mounted the coup, unhappy that Compaore supporters were barred from running in elections.\n\nThe vote was scheduled for Oct. 11 — but Prime Minister Zida said elections are postponed for several weeks.\n\nAt least 11 people died and 271 were wounded in violence after the coup, the government said.

0942_c7dfcf6e-76ce-477c-ab9c-f2b64c7709c8	By Perry Stein \n   The activists leading a rally in favor of gun control Thursday in front of the Capitol were speaking on behalf of loved ones who no longer could. \n    Richard Martinez’s 20-year-old son, Christopher, was shot and killed in the 2014 Isla Vista, California, shooting. DeAndra Yates’s 13-year-old son was shot in the head by a stray bullet while attending a friend’s birthday party in Indiana, left unable to speak or walk. The Rev. Sharon Risher lost her mother and two cousins in June’s Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting. \n    Most recently, Andy Parker’s daughter, Alison, was one of two people fatally shot outside Roanoke, Virginia, during a live television newscast. \n \n    “I come here in a state of raw and consuming grief,” said Parker, who has become a prominent gun-control activist in the weeks since his 24-year-old daughter’s death. “I’m not here because I want to be here; I am here because I have to be here.” \n    The hundreds of activists at Thursday’s “Whatever it Takes” rally — named after Parker’s mantra proclaiming that he will do “whatever it takes” to stop gun violence — did not call on Congress to pass sweeping gun reform laws, but narrowly lobbied for legislation that would mandate stricter background checks. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., unsuccessfully pushed for such legislation in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting. After high-profile shootings this past summer, there is renewed interest among gun-control advocates to revive that legislation. \n \n    Virginia Democratic Sens. Timothy Kaine and Mark Warner and Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe spoke at the rally, which was organized by Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization working to end gun violence formerly known as Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Most in attendance wore red shirts with the words “whatever it takes,” some donning ribbons honoring the victims of shootings at Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook. \n \n    “There’s nothing contradictory between background checks and the Second Amendment,” Warner said. “We can take the next step on background checks — not next year, but this year.” \n    Kaine, who was governor of Virginia when a gunman fatally shot 32 people at Virginia Tech, introduced legislation Tuesday that would hold gun dealers accountable for selling weapons to people who are barred from owning them. \n    “That’s why we’re here,” Kaine said. “We have got to act. The way you don’t let grief turn into despair is to act.” \n    The gun-control movement might have Virginia’s top Democrats on its side, but pushing gun-related legislation through Congress won’t be easy. When the Manchin-Toomey legislation failed, Democrats controlled the Senate. Republicans now have control of both chambers, making the odds of legislative success that much slimmer. \n \n    On Thursday, activists called out Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., whose district includes the Roanoke area where Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot, for not giving more attention to gun-violence measures. Goodlatte chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which controls legislation pertaining to guns. \n \n    “I will meet with anyone, anytime, any place,” Parker said. “So Rep. Goodlatte, I am waiting for your call. But I am here to say, if you are not in favor of background checks, we’ll find someone who is.” \n    Goodlatte’s office said Thursday afternoon that the two are scheduled to meet Friday. Goodlatte wouldn’t say whether he is in favor of expanded background checks, adding that there are laws in place that aren’t being enforced. \n    “I look forward to speaking again tomorrow with Mr. Parker and looking for additional ways to reduce gun violence, while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens,” Goodlatte wrote in an email. “At the same time, as I have previously pointed out to the administration, many of our nation’s gun laws are not enforced, and the Obama administration should take immediate steps to fully enforce the gun laws already on the books.” \n \n    Colin Goddard, who survived four gunshot wounds at Virginia Tech and is now a senior policy advocate for Everytown for Gun Safety, said he wishes people like Richard Martinez and Andy Parker never had to bury their children to become spokesmen for the cause. He said he hopes a shift in popular opinion can lead to incremental changes in the law. \n    “I wish none of these people were here. I wish I didn’t know Andy Parker,” he said. “But now that I do, let’s do something about it.” \n

Orders to this effect were issued today \n\n’’. \n\nGiving four weeks time to the government to file its response in a PIL seeking enforcement of already existing law prohibiting the slaughter of a bovine animal and its subsequent sale by anyone in the state, a division bench comprising Justice Dhiraj Singh Thakur and Justice Janak Raj Kotwal had on September 9 directed the Director General of Police to order all the district police heads and SHOs to ensure strict compliance of the RPC provisions, which provide for imprisonment and fine to anyone slaughtering a bovine animal or selling such slaughtered animal. \n\nThe Public Interest Litigation was filed in 2014 by Parimoksh Seth who later this year was engaged as Deputy Advocate General by the state government. \n\nThe high court order, however, drew angry protests from Valley with local politicians, religious and social leaders threatening to defy ban on coming Eid. Reacting to it, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders at Jammu have threatened economic blockade of Valley in case bovine animals were slaughtered on Eid. \n\nWith traders in Valley announcing to snap trade ties with their counterpart in Jammu in case VHP went ahead with its threat, the controversy is threatening to divide Jammu and Kashmir state on regional and religious lines as was the case during 2008 Amarnath land row agitation. To cool down tempers in the Valley, the state government had earlier shifted Vishal Sharma from Home to a comparatively less sensitive Education Department and asked Parimoksh Seth to withdraw the PIL. \n\nHowever, while Sharma had conveyed his displ…

Photo CC-BY JaneA Kelley \n \nI let my 6-month-old cat leave the safe room when she felt comfortable. She has has a hell of a time exploring the kitty proofed apartment. However, she retreats underneath couch (which I left unblocked, so she has somewhere to hide) when she is seemingly tired or skittish. I need to leave the apartment and go to sleep, so I desperately need to get her back in the safe room. How do I do this without scaring her or forcing her? \n \n~ Kathryn \n \nThomas: Well, Kathryn, we’re not sure from your letter why you need to keep your new cat in her safe room whenever you’re asleep or not home. Do you have another cat you’re concerned about? \n \nBella: If your 6-month-old is the only cat in the house, she actually needs to have the chance to explore the whole place on her terms. The safe room is a great idea for when you first bring her home, but if she’s the only kitty, it’s good to let her out to check out her new home after a couple of days. \n \nThomas: If you’re concerned that she may not know where her litter box and food are, you can always put another litter box in one of the common areas so she doesn’t have to go too far in order to do her business. \n \nBella: Since you’ve said your apartment has been carefully cat-proofed, we don’t think you need to worry too much about her getting in trouble or getting hurt while you’re away. \n \nThomas: But if you do need to coax her out, the best way to do so is with a toy. \n \nBella: Few cats can resist the allure of a “thing on a string,” so that’s what we recommend. \n \nThomas: If you use a toy like Da Bird or Neko Flies (both of which we love) or even a little toy mouse on the end of a shoelace, and you make it move like an object of prey, your kitten will come out of hiding to check it out. \n \nBella: It’s just feline nature! \n \nThomas: Playing with her using one of these toys is also a great way to build her confidence and get her out from under the furniture when you’re home, too. \n \nBella: In this video, a little British Blue kitten is playing with a thing-on-a-string toy, and you can see how it gets him excited and wanting to explore! \n \n\n \nThomas: So, Kathryn, coax your cat out of hiding and build her confidence by playing with her, and you’ll soon see that she settles happily into her new home. \n \nBella: And make sure you play with her every day so she can get her crazies out in a healthy way that doesn’t involve knocking things over. Also, give her plenty of toys she can play with on her own. \n \nThomas: You should see Bella playing kitty soccer with her toys, running all over the house, hurling them up in the air and catching them … it’s so much fun she even gets me going sometimes! \n \nBella: Don’t forget to put the thing-on-a-string toy away in a closet when you’re done using it. You don’t want her to get into trouble and eat the string or anything. \n \nThomas: That’s right. Eating string and ribbon can be very bad for your cat because it can get stuck in her intestines and cause a blockage. \n \nBella: So, Kathryn, we hope that helps. \n \nThomas: What about you other readers? Do you have tips on coaxing a shy kitty out from under or behind the furniture? Please share your ideas in the comments.

Surrogacy is an option but it does not answer the deep desire that women have to carry their own baby. \n\n\t\t\t \n"For a woman to carry her own baby - that has to be a wonderful thing." \n\nThe 10 women who will be selected for the trial must all meet strict criteria, which includes being 38 or under, having a long-term partner and being a healthy weight. \n\nMore than 300 women have approached the Womb Transplant UK team, of whom 104 meet the criteria. \n\nBefore the trial starts, embryos will be created and frozen using each woman's eggs and sperm from her partner. \n\nThe women will then undergo a six-hour transplant operation to receive a womb from a donor who is classed as brain dead but whose heart has been kept beating. \n\n\t\t\t \nAfter 12 months on immunosuppressant drugs and close monitoring, each woman will be implanted with one of her embryos, with the hope of achieving a successful pregnancy. \n\nAny baby would be delivered by Caesarean section to prevent the donor womb going through the stresses and strains of labour. \n\nMr Smith said the trial would use deceased donors rather than living ones owing to the complexities of the operation. \n\n"Donor retrieval is a bigger operation than transplanting the uterus into the recipient," he said. "We don't want to subject a live donor to that operation." \n\nSix months after giving birth, each woman will be given the option of trying for one more baby, or the womb will be removed by surgeons. \n\nThis is to minimise the risk of keeping women on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives, which have side-effects, including an increased risk of cancer. \n\nMr Smith needs to raise £500,000 for the trial. \n\n"I've always been an enormous optimist," he said. "The project has run with no money from the start. Somehow or other, somebody has always turned up and given us enough money to keep it going." \n\nOrgan donor co-ordinators have suggested that around five wombs per year could be made available to the surgical team. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
0946_64f6cead-ac39-4ab1-894c-496407ea0081	Emergency services are working to free two teenagers trapped in a school bus which overturned amid torrential rainfall and heavy flooding in north Cork. \n\nA school bus carrying a reported 30 students overturned in north Cork this morning. \n\nFire Brigade units from Fermoy, assisted by gardai, are working to free two trapped youngsters after more than 30 were freed following the accident. \n\nTorrential rainfall and flooding is being blamed for the accident which occurred at Cregg South on the Ballyhooly-Fermoy road in north Cork. \n\nThe accident happened just after 8.15am as the 30 seat coach was bringing students to Fermoy. \n\nIt is understood all the students are teenagers attending secondary schools in the Fermoy area. \n\nThe road remains closed and a special emergency plan has been put in place. \n\nThe coach was left lying partially on its roof. \n\nThere are no reports at this stage of any injuries. \n\nMotorists have been urged to avoid the area while emergency services attend the scene. \n\nSchools are liaising with the Gardai to keep parents informed. \n\nThe accident happened less than 12 hours after a 65-year-old man was killed when his car got caught in floods on Achill Island in Co Mayo. \n\nThe incident happened near Doogort on Achill Island at around 10pm yesterday. \n\nIt is understood that the man was pronounced dead at the scene, and a post mortem is due to be carried out at Mayo General Hospital. \n\nGardaí are investigating the incident. \n\nThe status orange rainfall warning remains in place for Kerry until midday, while the status yellow warning for Galway, Mayo and Clare, Cork and Limerick will also remain in place until the same time. Forecasters have warned that up to 70mm of rain will fall over Kerry before noon. \n\nThe worst driving conditions last night were in Clifden, Co Galway and Achill, Co Mayo, according to AA Roadwatch spokesperson Arwen Foley. \n\nLate last night, gardaí in Clifden warned motorists to travel only in exceptional circumstances due to extremely heavy rainfall. \n\nOvernight rainfall hampered driving conditions, and Sky road in Clifden was closed due to a small landslide onto the road, while Beach road was closed due to flooding. Road closures were also enforced in the Cleggan area. \n\nLast night, a part of the Ring of Kerry – between Kells and Caherciven – was impassable, but this road has since reopened. \n\n“In Kerry it stopped raining at around 11pm last night. There was flooding in a few places and parts of west Kerry seem to have been worst affected.” \n\nRoad conditions are described as slippery due to surface water. \n\nMs Foley said a few roads around Tralee were flooded and rendered impassable last night, and though these roads have reopened care is still needed. \n\nThe road between Mulranny and Achill in Mayo is now passable again, AA Roadwatch says. \n\nThe latest warnings came after flooding incidents in the south-west over the weekend. \n\nTwenty homes were flooded in Miltown Malbay in Co Clare. Fire crews rescued a couple trapped in their car in the coastal village of Liscannor, also in Clare, with the county council forced to issue a travel warning to other motorists. \n\n"It is like someone picked up our house and dropped it into the path of a river, I've never seen the like of it," said Liscannor resident Grainne Flannery. \n\n"We're used to water coming in from the sea but not down from the hills. It was so strange to see. Sandbags would have been useless because the water was coming from everywhere." \n\nIn Ballyvourney, Co Cork, gardai closed roads as flood waters turned to rivers. \n\nIn Cork city last night, residents of areas hit by flood waters were taking no chances as they deployed sandbags to protect their homes. \n\nThe rainfall at the weekend was exceptional, said Irish Weather Online's Fergal Tierney. \n\n"At least two trillion litres of rain fell on Ireland on Friday and Saturday," he said. \n\n"I took the average rainfall over the 26 synoptic stations - 23.6 mm. However, mountainous regions will have received several times this value, except there are no stations up there to record it. \n\n"It's a lot of water, whichever way you look at it. It's enough to fill almost 800,000 Olympic swimming pools." \n\nBut the same counties which were pounded by heavy rain on Friday and Saturday were at the centre of the new alerts last night, as more heavy rain hit the west and south-west. \n\n"We can expect heavy rain and thundery downpours with the possibility of localised flooding, particularly in the west and south-west," said Met Eireann forecaster Evelyn Cusack. \n\n"While the south-west and west will receive the brunt of the bad weather, the north and north-west will be mainly dry and bright, with just a few scattered showers." \n\nThe weather is expected to settle later today and remain mainly bright and dry tomorrow. But a new low-pressure front could bring very heavy rain to the east and south-east of the country on Wednesday. \n\n"There is a risk of another spell of heavy rain in parts of the south and east as another frontal depression tracks near Ireland," said Cusack. \n\n"It will be cool and breezy, with highest temperatures of only 12C to 15C in fresh to strong north-easterly winds." \n\nThursday and Friday will be bright, blustery days with sunny spells and good drying, alongside passing heavy showers. \n\nOnline Editors \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Livefyre. \n\nGrieving Irish mum keeps promise to dying son (26) with Australian trip in his honour \n\nStephanie Bell A grieving Irish mum has flown thousands of miles on a poignant pilgrimage to keep a promise to her dying son to mark his 26th birthday in the spot where he had dreamt of starting a new life. \n\nMum of feared criminal Alan Wilson found dead at home \n\nKen Foy The 63-year-old mother of one of Ireland's most feared gangland criminals has been found dead in her home in Dublin's south inner city. \n\nDonations flood in to cover funeral expenses of Temple Bar one-punch attack victim Gareth... \n\nLaura Larkin Donations have flooded in for the family of a Dublin man killed in a one-punch attack, following a fundraising appeal to help pay for his funeral.

Her 4.0-second short round earned her third place and put her second in the average for a toal of 115 points. In barrel racing, Robinson finished with a time of 17.05 seconds but hit a barrel in the short round. \n \nCalby Hanson scored a 7.6 in goat tying to split fifth and sixth and earn a trip to the short round. She matched her long-go time with another 7.6-second run, earning her a fourth-place finish in the short round and fourth in the average. \n \nThe Lady Generals competed well and had a few other athletes just miss out on making the short round. \n Kaylee Reimler guides her horse around a barrel during last season’s Sheridan College Rodeo at the Sheridan County Fairgrounds. The Sheridan College rodeo team will host the Pat Hamilton Memorial Rodeo this weekend at the fairgrounds. \nFile Photo | The Sheridan Press \nBreanna Reimler missed the short round in breakaway roping by a tenth of a second, and Savanna Bolich and Kaylee Reimler just missed the short round in breakaway, as well. \n \nThe Sheridan men couldn’t string together as many successful rides over the weekend, but there were a couple bright spots for head coach Marc Gilkerson. \n \nFreshman Sam Thurston, who just started riding broncs this past summer, won the long round in saddle bronc riding with a 66-point score. He wasn’t able to score in the short round. \n \n“He is doing quite well considering he just started riding broncs this past summer,” Gilkerson said. “What he lacks in experience he makes up for with try.” \n \nKash Deal also made the short round in saddle bronc riding with a 52-point ride, but he wasn’t able to score in the short round, placing him fifth in the average. \n \nWeston Hartman brought the crowd to its feet in the bull riding. After being bucked from the bull three times, he managed to pull off a 72-point ride to place fourth and fifth in the long round. \n \nHe too, though, was unable to score in the short round. \n \nThe Sheridan College Rodeo team members will look to get on the right track this weekend when they host the Pat Hamilton Memorial Rodeo at the Sheridan County Fairgrounds. \n The following two tabs change content below.

0948_04c84f3f-4c1e-43d2-a7e4-7cfd1833f148	WASHINGTON -- With a presidential debate and a contentious appearance in Congress coming, Hillary Rodham Clinton faces an October full of opportunity and risk for her presidential campaign. \n \nThe former secretary of state has spent months watching her poll numbers sink in crucial early voting states and faced endless questions about her email practices at the State Department. \n \nThe first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas and her congressional testimony before a Republican-led panel investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will give Clinton a big platform to make the case for her candidacy and challenge her Republican critics. \n \nThese events, of course, are equally a platform for opponents to try to weaken her. \n \nAlso in October, Clinton's campaign will disclose details about its fundraising and expenditures. The full Democratic field will appear at the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, which was a turning point for Barack Obama in his upstart bid against Clinton in the fall of 2007. \n \nThe most pivotal development could come from Vice President Joe Biden. His potential entry into the Democratic field could shake up the race and offer the party another alternative to Clinton, along with her chief rival now, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \n \nA preview of Clinton's October: \n \n__ \n \nBIDEN \n \nWill he or won't he? \n \nBiden's decision could have major ramifications for Clinton's standing in the primaries. If the vice president runs, he would give wary Democrats an excuse to abandon Clinton, even though she has locked up lots of congressional endorsements and financial donors. If Biden stays out, Clinton would campaign from a stronger position and could further make the case that she is the most electable Democrat against Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and others. Biden has said he is unsure whether he and his family will have the "emotional energy" for a campaign so soon after the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden. But his appearances around the country have turned into a parlor game for political insiders, creating a distraction for Clinton as she tries to consolidate support. \n \n__ \n \nFUNDRAISING \n \nClinton raised $47.5 million after launching her campaign in April. Her next fundraising report will show how she fared during the typical summer lull and give insiders a look into how efficiently her campaign is running. Clinton's team has built a massive operation at its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters and has hired dozens of field organizers in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where it has been spending about $400,000 a week on television advertising. Sanders is running a much leaner operation, and most of his $15.2 million haul in his first report came from donors giving $200 or less. Any signs that Clinton's fundraising edge is dwindling or she is burning through cash would set off more alarm bells in the party. \n \n__ \n \nFIRST DEBATE \n \nThe Oct. 13 debate in Nevada will give voters their first opportunity to measure Clinton on stage against Sanders and the rest of the field. Clinton has avoided directly criticizing Sanders' policy positions or his role in the primaries but her campaign has indicated voters may soon see a contrast between the two candidates. Clinton needs to tread carefully because she will need Sanders' supporters to help her campaign if she wins the nomination. Millions of people have tuned into the first two Republican debates, raising the potential stakes for Democrats. \n \nThere could be an element of surprise: CNN will allow Biden to participate even if he decides to become a candidate in the hours before the debate. Clinton's team sees debates as a strong suit for her. But observers remember her struggles, in an October 2007 debate, to answer a question about whether immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be issued driver's licenses. \n \n__ \n \nBENGHAZI TESTIMONY \n \nFor months, Clinton has tried to provide public testimony before the panel investigating her response to the Benghazi attack while she was President Obama's top diplomat. She will get that opportunity Oct. 22.  Supporters hope for a reprise of her fiery January 2013 appearance before lawmakers. Clinton's advisers view the October testimony as a chance for her to take on her Republican critics and predict some GOP lawmakers will overreach to the point of bullying her - imagery that could make the inquiry look like a political vendetta and boost her campaign. Still, the appearance could bring more attention to her use of a private email address and server and to questions about whether she exchanged classified information at the time. \n \n__ \n \nTHE J-J \n \nIf Clinton hopes to project strength in Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner is the place to do it. The Oct. 24 dinner typically draws thousands of hardcore Democratic activists. It's where eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry took on Howard Dean in the fall of 2003, and where Obama electrified Democrats in 2007. Some of Clinton's stronger moments during this campaign have come at large party events such as her speech before the New Hampshire state party convention, her address to the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis and her "Wing Ding" speech in Iowa, when she railed against Republicans playing "partisan games." Clinton's 2007 appearance at the dinner fell flat next to Obama's. How she stacks up in the hall against Sanders and potentially Biden could set the tone for the remainder of the Iowa campaign. \n \n__ \n \nFollow Ken Thomas and Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/kthomasdc and http://twitter.com/llerer \n \n__ \n \nThis story has been corrected to show that Beau Biden was 46, not 47, when he died.

0950_3ed0333e-f2ae-48bf-82ac-78def824674c	I am increasingly finding myself far more disinterested in the current reforms of the beer distribution system in Ontario than I am annoyed by them - but last week there were a couple of hints as to what is going on behind the closed process of government and industry negotiations that are worth noting if only for their entertainment value: = First, last Thursday Ben Johnson posted a great interview with the provincial Finance Minister in which he learned "the LCBO will roll out “craft beer zones” to 25 other LCBO locations across Ontario. Similar to the LCBO vintages section, these craft beer zones will feature and highlight craft beer made in Ontario." It would be similar if there weren't more than 300 Vintages locations in Ontario. Oddly, 20 years ago, the vintages section carried good beer, mainly imports but some local micros, too.\n= Second, Toronto's Metro confirmed that there will be annual limits to the works out to the equivalent of 279 six-packs — or about 70 cases of beer — sold daily per store... and also "unspecified penalties for retailers who try to sell more than their allocation"!! I think I mentioned this before but it's nice to see that it was not just my bad math. So... what does this mean? On a hot Friday in late July does the grocer cut off sales at 2 pm because the daily, weekly or monthly quota was reached?\nThese weird revelations are in addition to the numbers we have so far that indicate my city of 122,000 people will be lucky to get two of the new grocery store permits. More weirdness that remind me of something I came across some years ago now. Amongst my cult classic publications, I contributed the chapter "Beer and Autonomy" to the book Beer & Philosophy published in 2007. I opened the chapter with a quote from Pete Brown: "more than climate or genetics or anything else, drinking behaviours is governed by culture. And that culture is created by the laws that govern it." Looking at that now I that quibble with one word. Created. I would think now that the culture is expressed by the laws that govern it. I concluded the chapter with the thought that the beer laws of Canada ought to lead one to question the vision the state has of its own citizenry.\nThe more I write about Ontario in particular I now might question the vision the citizenry has of itself. These "reforms" are, yes, a bit more than shuffling the deck chairs but are so restricted that they must be messaging something related to cultural identity. Jordan has expressed measured optimism but I can't shake the feeling that we are dealing with a set of business and political interests that, in the words of one economic development officer spoken years ago in another province, is based on the principle "we pick the winners." Because the marketplace can't be trusted to pick the right winners. Because Ontarians can't be trusted and may not even trust themselves.

Television footage showed her looking frail and thin, being taken to hospital with swollen black eyes. \n \n"She told us that the couple beat her very often. Her hand was charred with a hot cooking paddle. She had injury marks all over her body," Rahman has said. \n \nShe is being treated at a hospital in Dhaka. \n \nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has suspended Hossain from all forms of cricket until the case is resolved. \n \n"Unless the investigation ends or there is a decision on the matter, BCB doesn't want to keep any attachment with him," ESPNcricinfo quoted BCB president Nazmul Hassan as saying. \n \n"We are quiet, and we will remain quiet. He is more than likely to stay outside cricket. \n \n"There is no reason to give Shahadat Hossain any leeway, it is quite clear. I don't know whether you know this, but he came to see me. I didn't meet him. What would I have told him? I don't have anything to do. It is totally up to the law of the land." \n \nThis effectively rules him out of next month's two tests against Australia, though he had injured his ankle in a test match in May and may not have played anyway. \n \nHossain has played 38 tests and 51 one-day internationals for Bangladesh. \n    \n- Sydney Morning Herald

His talk immediately follows the Museum’s popular Apple and Cheese Tasting and is free and open to the public. All are welcome to attend. \n \nAbout the Talk: Alexander Twilight Revealed will focus on the ideas and values of Alexander Twilight as revealed in an important primary source now preserved in Old Stone House Museum’s archival vault—a collection of 20 sermons in manuscript, hand-written ink by Twilight and hand-sewn into small booklets. Composed toward the end of Twilight’s life, these manuscripts are notes for sermons preached throughout Northern Vermont: in Brownington, Barton Orleans (called then Barton Landing), and Derby. Until 2003, these texts were unknown, but emerged from the archives of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul, as part of their holdings on Dr. James Woodward Strong (1833-1913), former president of Carlton College, who was born in Brownington and studied under Twilight at the Grammar School in 1841. The Old Stone House Museum now holds these documents and makes them available for scholarly study. \n \nAbout Alexander Twilight: Alexander Lucius Twilight (1795-1857) was principal of the Orleans County Grammar School and preached in the Brownington Church, beginning in 1829. Historical records portray Twilight as a devoted, strong willed, talented educator and preacher, whose skills earned him both the respect and esteem of his students. One of his main accomplishments was construction of the 4-story, granite school dormitory between 1834-36, known as the “Old Stone House.” Twilight was the first African American attendee of any college in the United States, graduating from Middlebury College in 1823. He was also the first American of mixed race to serve as a representative to Vermont’s State Legislature in Montpelier in 1836. Twilight is buried along with his wife Mercy Ladd Twilight in the church yard next to the Brownington Church where the talk will be held. \n \nAbout Laurence Hundersmarck: Professor Lawrence F. Hundersmarck teaches religion and philosophy at Pace University in New York and is also a seasonal resident in Barton, Vermont. He is author of numerous articles on the Renaissance and the Middle Ages, Eastern literature, and great thinkers of the Eastern and Western worlds. \n \nAbout the Old Stone House Museum: Established and run by the Orleans County Historical Society, the Old Stone House Museum is an historic neighborhood and museum whose mission is to educate the public through exhibitions, programs and classes that bring history to life. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, it encompasses six restored buildings and three neighboring structures dating from the first half of the 19th century. These include the Federalist homes of Reverend Alexander Twilight, first African American graduate of Middlebury College, progressive educator, and state legislator; and the first teacher educator Samuel Read Hall, who invented the chalkboard. It is also the site of the “Old Stone House,” a four-story granite dormitory built by Twilight in 1836 to house students attending the Orleans County Grammar School. \n \nGeneral Information: For more information about Orleans County Historical Society’s Old Stone House Museum please visit www.oldstonehousemuseum.org  or call 802-754-2022.

0954_441c233d-7dcd-47cd-bcd1-bef777497fce	NEW YORK  — The West Indian Day Parade is underway in New York City, but it's already been marred by violence. \n\nOne man was stabbed to death early Monday in Brooklyn, and others were wounded by gunfire. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says a man critically injured by a random bullet to the head is a Harvard-educated lawyer who works for the Empire State Development Corporation. \n\nThe raucous parade celebrating Caribbean culture features outlandish costumes, indigenous foods, loud music and scores of dancers. \n\nIt's also a significant political moment. Elected officials from across the city attended a breakfast before marching. \n\nThe festivities are expected to be the first time since July that Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio attend the same public event. The two have been engaged in a monthslong feud.

David Jordan, a member of Chirst Fellowship in North Carolina, preaches in support of the prayer rally at the Carter County Detention Center for Rowan County clerk Kim Davis in Grayson \n\n(Reuters) - The lawyer for a Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses said on Sunday he filed a notice of appeal over a contempt ruling that landed her in jail. \n\nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis was jailed last week for refusing to follow the orders of U.S. District Judge David Bunning. Davis had refused to issue the licenses, saying doing so would run counter to her deeply held Christian beliefs. \n\n"The contempt order itself was unlawful," Roger Gannam, a lawyer for Davis, told Reuters. Gannam is an attorney with Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based Christian religious advocacy organization that said it would back her legally. \n\nThe notice of appeal was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and lays a path for an appeal. \n\nIn Davis's absence, on Friday, deputy clerks issued marriage licenses to at least four same-sex couples at the offices in Morehead, Kentucky, where rival groups of demonstrators supporting Davis and the applicants protested outside. \n\nBunning had ordered Davis in August to issue the licenses. Her request for a stay of his order was denied by a U.S. appeals court and by the U.S. Supreme Court.

0956_75c070fd-e315-4e78-a922-cdff0c330eff	(CNN) -  \nA presidential debate in 2015 is only half the battle. The reaction on social media can also tell the tale of who did great and who flopped the debate. \n\nCNN's Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night was no different. \n\nHere are six of the biggest social media moments: \n\nCarly Fiorina takes on Donald Trump's remarks \n\nCarly Fiorina once again showed herself willing and able to go toe to toe with the leading candidates, taking Donald Trump to task for earlier comments he made about her. \n\nA Rolling Stone article quoted Trump as saying, "Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?" \n\nFiorina confronted him about those remarks on the debate stage in Simi Valley, California. \n\nIt was the most tweeted moment from the debate. \n\nBush admits to smoking marijuana \n\nIt wasn't exactly an "I didn't inhale" moment, but still quite the admission from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. And he had an apology that his team tweeted right after. \n\nThe many faces of "The Donald" \n\nDonald Trump, per usual, said a lot during the debate, but the faces he made throughout told the tale. \n\nBush demands Trump apologize \n\nBush and Trump had several moments going head-to-head, most notably when the former governor wanted Trump to apologize for remarks he made about his wife, Columba Bush, in a deleted tweet: "#JebBush has to like the Mexican Illegals because of his wife." Trump wasn't about to apologize, and Columba responded. \n\nCarly Fiorina's Planned Parenthood moment \n\nThe audience erupted in applause after Carly Fiorina made mention of the recent hidden camera videos targeting Planned Parenthood. \n\nThis moment ranked 2nd on Facebook for the night. \n\nBush vs. Trump on the most recent Bush president \n\nTrump laid into former president George W. Bush, and the younger Bush defended his brother's record. \n\nSomething that didn't take place on the debate stage \n\nA few people on social media were distracted from the actual debate, wondering who the young man was sitting behind Jake Tapper. \n\nEven Buzzfeed got into the act, posting a story about him. \n\nWell, CNN got in touch with him and his name is Greg Caruso of Los Angeles, an aspiring filmmaker who is not on Facebook or Twitter (and sorry, he declined to disclose his relationship status). \n\nHe first found out about the attention he was getting via texts from his friends and finds the whole thing to be funny. \n\n"It's pretty hilarious," he said. "Social media can focus on some guy at the debate instead of the debate."

I'm not one of these guys who wants to go colonise mars in the first wave of people. \n \n\n                            \n"I think we have to get off the planet so we can protect the species from one extinction level event." \n \n\n                            \nIn 'The Martian', the 44-year-old actor - who raises daughters Alexia, 16, Isabella, nine, Gia, seven, and Stella, four, with wife Luciana - plays an astronaut who gets left behind on Mars alone, and he had to spend five weeks shooting with no other actors on set. \n \n\n                            \nAnd Matt admitted he would love to get a little bit more alone time in his personal life. \n \n\n                            \nHe laughed to 'Entertainment Tonight Canada': "I love being with my kids but you can attest to the fact that you would take a day alone now or then if you could get it. \n \n\n                            \n"I wouldn't want to be alone for more than a day or two..I think a day would be good. You kind of re-set , re-charge."
0958_7c4b0e4b-e481-4902-a6d8-979193ccede0	Single mother and businesswoman Sussanne Khan criticized the gossip mongers and denied the reports of her wedding with actor Arjun Rampal. The former wife of Hrithik Roshan added that such a gossip can hurt as it involves families and human emotions. \nSussanne released a statement which said, “Persistent speculation in the media has made me realise that idle Bollywood gossip mongers, who are influential, are insistent on spreading rumours and lies about me.” The statement added that stories were fabricated about her upcoming wedding with Rampal and meetings at the coffee shop. \nThe interior designer slammed the press for posting such irresponsible and stories and added, “I am a single working mother and take tremendous pride in the way I live.” Recent rumours had claimed that close friend Arjun Rampal had come close to Sussanne and that they were soon going to tie the knot. \nKhan has earlier clarified that Arjun was not the reason behind her split with Hrithik and that nobody was to be blamed for it. Hrithik and Sussanne got married in 2000 and have two sons Hrehaan and Hridaan. The couple put an end to their relationship in December 2013 just a few days before their wedding anniversary. \n \nPhoto Credits: Viral Bhayani \n \nThe post Sussanne Khan irked by media spreading false rumours appeared first on Bollywood Garam .

Charles Joseph Gliniewicz stretched toward a second day, a sheriff's office spokesman said. \n\nAuthorities from across the state and region poured into the village about 60 miles north of Chicago after the shooting Tuesday morning, some wearing tactical gear and toting high-powered rifles. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the search for the suspects, Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said.  \n\n   \n   \nThe search for three men who allegedly shot dead a police officer in Fox Lake, Illinois on Tuesday continued over night.

Gliniewicz died of his injuries, Covelli said. \n\nAn emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. \n \n'We lost a family member,' Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as 'GI Joe.' ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.' \n\nThe area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. \n\nAuthorities urged residents throughout the area to stay home while they conducted the search for three men, two of them white and the other black, aided by the canines and helicopters. \n\nThe service of a local commuter train was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay in their homes — with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. \n   \nA manhunt is underway in a Chicago suburb after a police officer was reportedly shot dead while on a routine patrol.

And on Wednesday, seven area schools canceled classes, Covelli said. \n\nGliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. \n\nAround Fox Lake, residents expressed their own sorrow over the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. \n\n'This particular officer is a pillar in my community and definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,' said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher who lives in the community. \n\nDozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. \n\nThirty-year-old Dan Raminick held a sign that said 'Police Lives Matter.'

0960_0fd8887d-9134-427b-8594-0b0be0e17c97	7:27 p.m. EDT \n \nCANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian prime minister elect Malcolm Turnbull promised to focus on improving the country's faltering economy as the public woke up on Tuesday to its fourth leader in two years. \n \nThe ruling Liberal Party voted to oust Tony Abbott as prime minister in favor of Turnbull, a multi-millionaire former tech entrepreneur who is hugely popular with the electorate, in a secret ballot late on Monday. \n \n"I'm filled with optimism and we will be setting out in the weeks ahead ... more of those foundations that will ensure our prosperity in the years ahead," Turnbull told reporters as he headed to parliament on Tuesday. \n \nAbbott was deposed following months of opinion polls that showed his popularity with the public near rock bottom as Australia's $1.5 trillion economy struggles to cope with the end of a once-in-a-century mining boom. \n \nTurnbull, toppled as leader of the conservative Liberal Party by Abbott in 2009, has consistently been seen as a preferred prime minister. However, his support for a carbon trading scheme, gay marriage and an Australian republic have made him unpopular with his party's right wing. \n \nTurnbull is widely expected to overhaul the cabinet, with current Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has been battling a backlash against a deeply unpopular budget, likely to be replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison. \n \nDefense Minister Kevin Andrews, who is overseeing a A$50 billion ($35.70 billion) submarine tender, is also expected to be replaced when Turnbull unveils his ministry later this week. \n \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop, who won the party room vote to retain her additional position as deputy prime minister, said she had spoken with international leaders overnight about the leadership change. \n \nThe opposition Labor Party was quick to label Turnbull a "multi-millionaire who lives in a pink mansion on Sydney Harbour" who was out of touch with everyday Australians. \n \nThe change of leaders is the latest sign of political instability in Australia, which has in recent years been convulsed by backroom machinations and party coups that have shaken public and business confidence in government. \n \nLabor's Kevin Rudd, elected prime minister with a strong mandate in 2007, was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010 amid the same sort of poll numbers that Abbott faced. Gillard was in turn deposed by Rudd ahead of elections won by Abbott in 2013. \n \n($1 = 1.4006 Australian dollars) \n \n(Reporting by Jane Wardell; Editing by Dean Yates)
0961_d8ed88e3-d9a7-46be-9dc0-28cbf84667b4	An arthritis diagnosis increases the risk of falling into poverty, according to an Australian study. \n \nArthritis is a very debilitating disease and likely impacts labor force participation, either forcing people to retire early due to the pain or physical restriction of arthritis, reducing the hours they can work or changing to a lower-paid job, said lead author Emily Callander, a research fellow at the University of Sydney. \n \n"For those who are already in retirement it may be that the costs of treatment or costs of accessing aids or career services have required them to draw down some of their assets, which would lower the income they derive from their assets," Callander told Reuters Health by email. \n \nThe researchers studied more than 4,000 Australian adults between 2007 and 2012. \n \nAt the start of the study, the participants were not in poverty and did not have arthritis. By 2009, 300 of the participants had developed arthritis, half of whom were men. Over the study, 18 percent of women and 16 percent of men fell into poverty based on income, and the proportion in poverty increased with age. \n \nWomen who developed arthritis were 51 percent more likely to fall into income poverty than nonarthritic women. For men, arthritis increased the risk by 22 percent. \n \nWomen were also more likely to fall into poverty by a definition encompassing income, health and education attainment, or "multidimensional poverty," according to the results in Arthritis and Rheumatology. \n \n"It is known that people with lower incomes are more likely to develop arthritis, but this is the first study to show the inverse relationship - that arthritis could also lead to income poverty," Callander said. \n \nWomen are more likely than men to have severe arthritis, which may make it harder for them to work, but that dimension was not included in this study, she noted. \n \n"In our analysis we did take into consideration other factors, such as age, being married or in a de facto relationship as opposed to being single, being a home owner as opposed to renting or having a mortgage, and whether the person lived in a major city, an inner regional area or a rural area," she said. "However, even after considering all these other factors, being diagnosed with arthritis still leads to an increased risk of poverty." \n \nBut the study did not account for other health issues, including obesity, which increases the risk for arthritis and is more common among people with lower socioeconomic status, said Dr. Gillian Hawker, chair of Medicine at the University of Toronto, who was not involved in the research. \n \n"Poverty is associated with poor diet and less opportunity for physical activity which increases the risk for obesity and in turn for osteoarthritis," Hawker told Reuters Health by email. \n \nWe should first address the common risk factors, particularly obesity, and ensure that all people with arthritis have access to surgical and non-surgical treatment, she said. \n \nPreventing arthritis would reduce the health burden as well as the economic burden, but as the population ages in many countries, arthritis will continue to become more common, so it will also be important to help those with the condition remain in the workforce, Callander said. \n \n"We know, for example, that workplace modifications may help people remain in employment, so encouraging employees and employers to look at these options would be a great start," she said. \n \n"One of the most important considerations should be that any arthritis interventions - be it treatment or prevention - should be equally effective in both low and high income patients, this will ensure that our health interventions do not widen inequality gaps," she said. "Furthermore, when treating arthritis patients, health professionals should be aware of this greater risk of income poverty, and consider a patient's ability to pay for any out of pocket costs when determining considering treatment options and devising treatment plans." \n \nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1USRI6C Arthritis and Rheumatology, online September 8, 2
0962_c60c7a34-173f-4ab1-9d66-0abdc667ff9b	IMDb\nA football player and his friends travel to the planet Mongo and find themselves fighting the tyranny of Ming the Merciless to save Earth.\nRogerEbert\nNot since "Infra-Man" has a movie opened with a development more ominous than the crisis facing Earth at the beginning of "Flash Gordon." But Earth scientists are playing it cool: A NASA spokesman denies that there's anything unusual about an unexpected total eclipse of the sun. Unusual? That the moon is out of its orbit? Ha! It takes a mad scientist like Dr. Hans Zarkov to realize that the Earth is under attack, and speed to the rescue in his private space ship-with Flash Gordon and Dale Arden aboard as unwilling passengers.\nIf memory serves, this is more or less the same beginning as in the original movie serialization of "Flash Gordon," back in 1936. Even if it's not, this new Dino De Laurentiis production is true to the tacky pop origins of the Flash Gordon comic strip and the serials starring Buster Crabbe. At a time when "Star Wars" and its spin-offs have inspired special effects men to bust a gut making their interplanetary adventures look real, "Flash Gordon" is cheerfully willing to look as phony as it is. I DON'T mean that as a criticism. You can make a city float in the clouds and look marginally realistic (as in "The Empire Strikes Back"), but there's something sort of fun about the "Flash Gordon" city that floats in the clouds and looks like a large miniature model floating in fake clouds. And as the spaceships lumber past on the screen, I really wouldn't have minded if they'd left a tube of model airplane glue lying in the lower left-hand corner. "Flash Gordon" is played for laughs, and wisely so. It is no more sophisticated than the comic strip it's based on, and that takes the curse off of material that was old before it was born. This is space opera, a genre invented by Edgar Rice Burroughs and Hugo Gernsback and other men of unlimited imagination harnessed to definitely limited skills. It's fun to see it done with energy and love and without the pseudo-meaningful apparatus of the Force and Trekkie Power. The plot is simple: The Emperor Ming (Max von Sydow), bored with life in the universe, decides to pick on Earth. After warming up with a few hurricanes and earthquakes, he sends the moon spinning down toward the planet. Meanwhile, Zarkov, Flash (Sam J. Jones, last seen as Bo Derek's husband in "10") and Dale (Melody Anderson) crash-land in Ming's imperial space city. There are intrigues afoot, but meanwhile Dale catches Ming's eye, he determines to marry her, and Flash finds himself fighting for his life with a gladiator. Mike Hodges, the British director hired by De Laurentiis to orchestrate this comic space opera, is true to the visual tradition Of the, original serials: Everyone is dressed in capes and ridiculous boots and headdresses, and stand, around on the command decks of ornate space ships. There's an imperial court to applaud and boo at the appropriate times. And there's a cliff-hanging showdown when the Hawk Men, looking amazingly like the winged angels in De Laurentiis' production as "Barbarella" (1968), engage the crew of a space ship in hand-to-hand battle (you know there's something lacking with the Ming technology when the commander of the rocket ship shouts "Stand by to the repel invaders!"). Is all of this ridiculous? Of course. Is it fun? Yeah, sort of, it is. Rotten Tomatoes MOVIE INFO In this campy adventure movie, Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) of comic strip fame, struggles to save the world from the dastardly scheme of Emperor Ming the Merciless (Max vonSydow).

0963_d662b796-9e7d-4cdc-b02b-51f2b6b030e9	The series finale of "Key & Peele" took a trip to the magical land of "Negrotown." \n\nA musical spoof with a tune so catchy you'll want to sing it all day long at work -- but really, really shouldn't -- the "Negrotown" sketch was an apt way to send off a series that, in sketches like " Auction Block " and " Gun-Crazy Cop, " has provided scathingly funny and sadly relevant commentary on race relations in America. \n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Arts & Culture newsletter >> \n\nIn the sketch (which was actually released online well ahead of its network airing Wednesday night), a character played by Keegan-Michael Key is about to be arrested by a white police officer for no apparent reason, when suddenly he is whisked away to Negrotown. \n\n"Negrotown? What? Like Atlanta?" Key asks his guide, played by Peele. \n \nNot exactly. Negrotown is a candy-colored Utopia for black people, where "you can walk the street without getting stopped harassed or beat" and "wear your hoodie and not get shot."  \n\nAlas, the place "where the strong black men are raining down" and "there's no disease, no sickle cell" is but a fantasy. Key's character wakes up from the beautifully choreographed dream to find himself being shoved into a police car.  \n\n"I thought I was going to Negrotown?" he says, bewildered. \n\n"Oh, you are," replies the police officer ominously. \n\n(You can watch the whole sketch here , but be warned: It includes lots of potentially offensive language.)  \n\nElsewhere in the series finale, we found out just why Key and Peele have been on the road for the last two seasons: They've been trying to get far enough away from their wives to safely use the word "bitch." It's a nice way to touch on another of this show's recurring themes, macho posturing, and is also, of course, a callback to a classic sketch from the pilot , which starred Key and Peele as married men trading tales of dominating their spouses -- but only when said wives were out of earshot. \n  \nRelations between the sexes figured prominently in the hour-long episode, which also featured the almost-breakup of Meegan and Andre, the world's most poisonous relationship. Meegan, she of the creaky voice and pancake makeup, once again proved herself to be a master of passive-aggressive manipulation, luring dim-witted Andre back into the relationship against his will. \n \nThere was also room in the finale for some of the pop culture-inspired silliness that "Key & Peele" does every bit as well as the hot-button subjects.  Peele starred in a spoof ad for a compilation of would-be "major motion picture themes" by Ray Parker Jr., of "Ghostbusters" fame. The album includes songs for movies as "12 Years a Slave" (sample lyrics: "Who's a slave? I'm not a slave!") but not, it should be noted, "Ghostbusters." You've been warned. \n\nThere was even a bit reflecting on the legacy of "Key & Peele," which Peele claimed, somewhat facetiously, was “the greatest comedy or otherwise show ever made," and ranked alongside "Dallas" and "The Twilight Zone" as one of the all-time greats (what, no "Breaking Bad"?). \n\n"I think that it’s very possible, like, we’ll go down like the Wright Brothers," he said, catching himself. "Am I going too far? Am I overblowing it?” \n\nMaybe a skosh, but it's certainly been nooice  having them around. \n\nFollow @MeredithBlake on Twitter. \n\nMORE: \n\nStephen Colbert gets raw with 'supervillain' Tesla founder Elon Musk \n\nMarvel gives 'Jessica Jones' a release date and her first teaser trailer \n\nHere's why the outrageously important 'Key & Peele' is comedy's jam \n  \n Copyright © 2015, Orlando Sentinel
0964_ce864f86-6410-47eb-9453-460f7397e382	  Statement by the President Commemorating the Twentieth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women I am proud to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.  Today we recommit ourselves to the basic principle affirmed there, namely that “[w]omen's empowerment and their full participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society, including participation in the decision-making process and access to power, are fundamental for the achievement of equality, development and peace.”  The United States understands that women's rights are human rights, and that empowered women and educated girls are critical to achieving lasting peace, security, and prosperity.  Over the last 20 years we have made tremendous strides toward gender equality:  We have worked with Congress to reauthorize the groundbreaking Violence Against Women Act--enacting new protections and strengthening existing protections, including for LGBT individuals and Native American survivors of domestic violence.   Through the Affordable Care Act, we have dramatically increased access to quality, affordable health care for women and girls across the United States and put an end to women being charged more for healthcare than men. With our National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security and by chairing the Equal Futures Partnership, we are encouraging and supporting women’s economic and political empowerment both at home and abroad.   Within the United States, we are taking steps to support working families, encourage women and girls to pursue careers in the STEM fields, and provide additional opportunities for women entrepreneurs. But we know that much work remains.  Women and girls continue to face violence and discrimination at home, at work, in school, and in their communities.  Women continue to be paid less than men for equal work.  In too many places around the world, girls do not have the same educational opportunities as boys.  Too often, women’s contributions are undervalued, under-utilized, and suppressed.  And in too many places -- from China to Egypt, from Russia to Venezuela -- women have been swept up in repressive crackdowns on civil society, and deprived of their universal rights and fundamental freedoms.  That’s why my administration continues to work to advance the empowerment and education of women and girls here and abroad.  It's why we are dedicating additional resources to address violence against women and girls.  It's why we are investing in job training and apprenticeships to help women earn better-paying jobs.  It is why we launched Let Girls Learn, to address the challenges adolescent girls around the world face in enrolling, completing and succeeding in school.  And it is why my Administration's Stand With Civil Society initiative is supporting the right of women and all people around the world to work peacefully for the betterment of their societies without fear that their rights and freedoms will be unjustly abridged. Today, we renew our resolve to work tirelessly toward a world where every woman and girl can enjoy the rights and freedoms that are her birthright. We pledge to continue this work in partnership with the independent civil society advocates and experts who have led the fight for women's empowerment, as envisioned when the international community convened 20 years ago.  And we remind ourselves of all of the noble promises of that conference, and rededicate ourselves to making them a reality.   Source: The White House, Office of the Press Secretary  
0965_4936741d-3ad2-45e1-9384-80475ee03e1c	Set in the 1970s for no good reason except to showcase a few sideburns and groovy shirts, Cut Snake is a not-quite thriller, not-quite drama about a man with a past Merv (Alex Russell) whose idyllic new life engaged to Paula (Jessica DeGouw) is threatened by the sudden appearance of Jim “Pommie” Stuart (Sullivan Stapleton), a tough ex-con who wants to tempt Merv back into his old ways. The new film from Tony Ayres (Walking on Water, The Home Song Stories) has an impressively cracked and volatile star in Stapleton, who looks like he’d head butt you as soon as look at you, but low stakes, an anaemic storyline, and poorly drawn supporting characters. The film threatens to become interesting during a scene set in a drag club but backs shyly away from queer issues every time it raises them. Its title suggests a hint of madness: instead, it’s utterly conventional and lacking in fangs.

With her are members of the commission. [PHOTO: WILLIS AWANDU/STANDARD] \n\nTeachers have until September 18 to return to work or risk being struck off the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) payroll. \n\nTSC Chairperson Lydia Nzomo said only teachers who have been performing their duties will be paid in full. Ms Nzomo said those who will regard the call before the deadline will also be paid but only for the days worked. \n\n"Teachers who will not have heeded the call will be removed from the payroll. Consequently, their salaries will be stopped and their names struck out of the TSC payroll," threatened Nzomo, who had earlier sounded a warning to teachers who have absconded duty that they will not earn their salaries. \n\nShe added that TSC county directors have submitted details of teachers who have been on duty since August 31. \n\nNzomo said at least 22 per cent of primary and 54 per cent of secondary schools are currently operational. "Most of these are school administrators who include principals, deputy principals and heads of departments in the case of secondary schools and head teachers, their deputies and senior teachers for primary schools," she said. \n\nThe commission still maintains that it does not have the resources to pay a monthly figure of Sh1.6 billion, saying they were only allocated Sh174 billion for the financial year 2015-2016 for teachers' salaries and allowances. \n\nSee also: Use CDF to pay teachers, Duale tells MPs \n\nThe Court of Appeal last month ordered the commission to pay the teachers a salary increase of between 50 and 60 per cent spread over four years. \n\nAs the teachers strike entered its third week yesterday, teachers unions maintained their stand saying they will only call it off once the Government implements the increment. \n\nFollowing President Uhuru Kenyatta's remarks that there is no money to pay the award, Kenya National Union of Teachers called on Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi and Nzomo to stop "giving the wrong advice to the President". \n\nDeputy President William Ruto also recently called on teachers to respect the position taken by the commission and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission's that there was no money to pay them. \n\nClick to Download full copy \n\nJudge dissolves sexless marriage after wife proves her virginity in court proceedings Impotence is perhaps one of the least spoken about challenges in marriage.

0968_dd99c9cf-75f5-45de-b114-b45eb90305a2	As I announced a couple of days ago, today I’ll present a workflow that further increases the High-ISO range of Merrill and Quattro Foveon sensors when taking color pictures. In contrast to the blue channel workflow, which is able to improve noise performance in black-and-white images almost without any side-effects, this particular workflow is a compromise between resolution and noise. My aim is to reduce luminance and colored cloud noise that is typical of Foveon sensors as much as possible, without making the images look softer than those taken with comparable Bayer sensor cameras. However, I haven’t yet found a magical way to make noise in color images disappear completely. ;)

Photo: V.V.K. Krishnan \n\nTOPICS \n\n‘Swades’ versus ‘Srimanthudu’. And the idea of the socially relevant ‘mass’ movie. \n\nA few weeks ago, Mahesh Babu’s Srimanthudu had a subtitled release in Chennai. I must say it was a brave move. Not because it was a Telugu film — these Telugu ‘mass’ films (or wide-appeal masala movies) are practically identical to the ones in Tamil — but because it referred to Mahesh Babu as ‘Super Star.’ As we all know, there’s just one of those in these parts. But back to that ‘mass’ film business. Srimanthudu has all the expected formula elements. The hero introduction scene (during Ram Navami celebrations, where there’s pleasant confusion about who exactly is being deified)... The heroine entry scene (she’s in a salwar kameez, drawing a kolam/rangoli on the porch; in other words, she’s non-threatening desi arm candy)... The villain establishing shot (he brings down a log of wood on some poor man’s skull, and he’s so evil, he doesn’t stop there; he orders his men to throw this man on the road, so he can get crushed by a passing truck)... \n\nBut Srimanthudu is a little different from the usual mass movie, in that it has what the industry would call a ‘soft’ subject. It’s about a billionaire who doesn’t care for money, who’s not interested in taking over his father’s business. He keeps associating with the lower classes — at one point, he hands over lakhs of rupees for the wedding of an employee’s daughter. (We’re not meant to ask things like: Wouldn’t it be better if he said something against dowry and found the girl a groom who accepted her for what she is? This is about the hero’s heart, his big, golden heart.) And later, goaded by his girlfriend’s taunts, he adopts a village — he uses his wealth to build roads, schools, hospitals, and so on. So the film is a bit of Rudraveena (Unnal Mudiyum Thambi in Tamil), a bit of the Buddha’s life, a bit of Swades... \n\nIt’s the latter, mostly, that keeps coming to mind. This isn’t an exact comparison. You might say that there isn’t a single moment in Srimanthudu as powerful, as intimate as the one in Swades where the NRI protagonist buys non-bottled water from a little boy at a nondescript railway station. But then, that was a different kind of movie, the equivalent of a close-up — Srimanthudu, on the other hand, is a wide-angle shot. Swades devoted a lot of its running time to detail how this man changes this village, while in Srimanthudu, it all happens over the course of one song. But this isn’t about which is the better film. This is about how the same premise is treated in two modes of popular Indian filmmaking — a relatively ‘realistic’ mode (Swades) and an unapologetically larger-than-life mode (Srimanthudu). So Swades has a protagonist, while Srimanthudu has a hero — one who has to perform periodic goon-bashing duties in order to remind the mass audience that despite his do-gooding impulses he can be a badass. \n\nIs there another country where there’s such tonal variety in mainstream cinema? Elsewhere, you have popular cinema (released in large numbers of theatres all at once, and aiming to make tons of money from all audiences) and art cinema (released in a few theatres, for a select audience) — but here, even the popular cinema can go the way of a Srimanthudu or a Swades. What’s more interesting, the line between art cinema and popular cinema has begun to blur in at least one respect. Once upon a time, the mass films were mainly about power struggles — so you had the village-based films where the hero was a lowly farmer and the villain a zamindar, or the city-based films where the hero was a lowly clerk and the villain a politician or gangster. But in the past few years, mass films (at least the ones in Tamil and Telugu) have begun to look at the kind of ‘socially relevant’ issues usually relegated to documentaries and art-house cinema. \n\nSrimanthudu hints at how private enterprise can play a part in the rehabilitation of underdeveloped villages. The Vijay blockbuster Kaththi brought into focus farmer suicides and the role played by multinationals in depleting water resources. Ajith’s Yennai Arindhaal had a subplot about organ trafficking and Sivakarthikeyan’s Kakki Sattai talked about migrant workers. Seen one way, this is just lip service. These films are not really about any of these issues — complex realities are often dismissed with simplistic solutions, like taking an aspirin for cancer. \n\nOftentimes, it’s just that the directors are trying to avoid cliché, thinking up out-of-the-box villains for the hero to go up against. But look at it another way. Should we be happy that a medium that reaches millions is at least throwing these topical subjects into the conversation around a movie? \n\nOn a tangential note, I was happy Srimanthudu was released here. The point isn’t about the quality of the film, the “is it worth watching?” question. The point is that the regional films that end up in cities outside the ‘region’ of the film’s making are almost always pedigreed films — like the impressive Court (Marathi). But watching Court does not translate into watching ‘Marathi cinema’ — just like you’re not going to get an idea about French cinema in general by watching Godard. That’s not what the average French moviegoer sees, the commercial, mainstream stuff. These regular films are important too. What are we like as audience? What do we find socially or culturally acceptable enough to drag our families to? What kind of film do we open up our wallets for? These are important questions, and the best answers come from our mainstream movies. \n\nBaradwaj Rangan is The Hindu’s cinema critic. \n\nKeywords: Baradwaj Rangan, Screening Room column, 'mass' cinema, Swades, Srimanthudu

What have I done?'" \n \nWatch Emily Blunt on 'Today' \n \nRight-wing TV commentators seized the opportunity to attack Blunt, with Fox & Friends host Anna Kooiman firing back, "You know what, then why don't you leave Hollywood...? Let some American women take on the roles that you're getting, because Americans are watching your movies and lining your pockets!" \n \nBlunt has since responded to the controversy, insisting she meant no harm when she made the innocent remark. \n \nAddressing Kooiman's demands for her to leave Hollywood on Thursday, Blunt told Today, "It was so not the intention to hurt anybody or cause any offence so I really apologize to those that I caused offence (to). It was just an offhand joke."

0973_62b18dbb-6fae-46e8-b720-046d1bf9371c	) - Bluewolf , a global consulting agency, has released its fourth annual The State of Salesforce Report that evaluates how companies use and capitalize on the promise of the world's #1 CRM platform. Based on insights from more than 1,500 Salesforce customers worldwide, the 2015-2016 report explores companies' focus on employee engagement and innovation as they position themselves for growth. \n\nDownload the full report here . \n   \nA third of companies cite employee-facing initiatives as one of their top objectives for 2016. In past years, companies have primarily focused on improving the customer experience to increase their bottom line. However, a focus only on the customer experience is an incomplete engagement approach. As customer expectations rise, so do employee expectations. Today's modern-day employee was raised in a digital environment, where constant connectivity and mobile access are an inherent part of their lives. Every day, they are exposed to apps and products that make their lives easier, and are less tolerant of business processes and technology that don't follow suit. \n\nAccording to the report, companies are three times more likely to attribute measureable business outcomes to the use of Salesforce when employees believe that Salesforce makes their jobs easier. The more engaged employees become, the more value they can provide to customers. \n\n"In today's customer-driven market, it's easy to overlook the employee experience. However, it is the very force that enables customer success," said Eric Berridge, CEO, Bluewolf. " The State of Salesforce Report shows that while innovation is essential to improving employee experiences, companies must combine it with data, design, and an employee culture willing to adopt it to see improvements across the entire organization." \n\nBluewolf's 2015-2016 The State of Salesforce Report uncovers several key trends tied to prioritizing employee engagement, including: \nKnow the customer, one cloud at a time - 64 percent of Salesforce customers plan to increase their Salesforce budgets in the coming year; 11 percent plan to increase spending by more than 50 percent. Additionally, 49 percent of customers are currently invested in two or more Salesforce clouds, and 22 percent of customers are invested in three or more Salesforce clouds. Turn Salesforce from chore to choice - 90 percent of companies say improving the user experience of sales apps is key to their sales strategy in the coming year. Furthermore, employees state that they are two times more likely to say Salesforce makes it easier to do their jobs when they can access it from a mobile device. Mobile-optimized tools and applications are critical to selling smarter and faster with Sales Cloud, and supporting intelligent, relevant, and streamlined workflows to maximize productivity. The customer executive is now the empowered agent - 59 percent of service professionals believe it's easier to use their company's Salesforce instance today than it was a year ago. Additionally, one in three companies have already invested in agent productivity apps; one in five are planning to invest. The best companies are leveraging Service Cloud to consolidate service channels and support a more informed and productive agent experience. For marketers, data is their customer - 60 percent of marketers cite poor or inconsistent data quality and lack of data access as their biggest challenge. As a result, only one in five companies believe their marketing messages are extremely personalized. Data-driven decisions separate a leading marketer from the competition. This year, leading marketers need to focus on partnering with IT to support a mature data governance strategy. Analytics is top of mind - 68 percent of companies will increase their investments in analytics in the coming year. In the past year, six percent of companies surveyed have adopted the new Analytics Cloud -- and 14 percent plan to invest in the coming year. The best companies are moving up the analytics maturity scale by investing in predictive and prescriptive intelligence tools to lead data-driven insights and take the best next action. Invest in ongoing innovation - Companies have realized the importance of investing in ongoing innovation and are embracing governance and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) to produce high quality releases with increasing speed. Companies that have both a governance board and an ALM solution are three times more likely to attribute revenue growth to their Salesforce usage. This year, there was a 20 percent jump in companies releasing at least monthly and three times as many companies releasing at least weekly. \nBluewolf's annual report surveyed more than 1,500 Salesforce customers. The respondents were employees of very large enterprises (more than 1,000 employees), large enterprises (up to 1,000 employees), and medium to small enterprises (fewer than 500 employees). The study was conducted via online survey in the second and third quarters of 2015. \n\nSalesforce and others are among the trademarks of salesforce.com , inc. \n\nAbout Bluewolf \nBluewolf is a global consulting agency that builds digital solutions designed to create results.

0974_072d4574-0685-4d05-a784-7ed02b1da5f9	Verint ® Systems Inc. ( NASDAQ: VRNT ) today announced enhancements to its Verint \n      Situational Awareness Platform ™ , including the \n      incorporation of advanced solutions to help organizations gain \n      comprehensive situational awareness while driving rapid incident \n      response and enhanced field communications. This evolutionary \n      situational awareness platform is designed to provide security \n      executives and operators actionable intelligence and better insight by \n      incorporating unified situation monitoring, dispatch and incident \n      response, live field communications and real-time citizen input. \n\nThe Verint Situational Awareness Platform enables command-and-control \n      operators to play a valued and active role in incident management and \n      response by notifying users of emergency situations based on their \n      location. Additionally, data from mobile devices can be sent to the \n      command center, enabling the general public to report security concerns \n      and issues in real-time in support of the overall well-being of the \n      communities they live and work in. Using the Verint solution, first \n      responders and security personnel can leverage the Actionable \n      Intelligence ® it provides to gain a better understanding and \n      clearer picture of incidents through immediate information sharing in \n      the field. \n   \nThe extension of the Verint Situational Awareness Platform is \n      transforming the way users engage with responders, field resources, \n      other public safety stakeholders and the general public. It combines \n      situational awareness with built-in dispatch and bi-directional \n      information flow for continuous communication between citizens, intake \n      operators, field resources and command center personnel, and allows \n      responders to provide mobile reporting through video streaming and live \n      images. This correlates information from multiple sources into a single \n      platform for a unified view, enabling faster, more intelligent \n      decision-making in routine and emergency events. Additionally, the \n      solution can alert command-and-control operators from sensors and \n      provide Geographical Information Science (GIS) mapping, live \n      surveillance and other location information to help identify the closest \n      resources to dispatch for more rapid, efficient response. Comprehensive \n      incident reporting with multimedia options offers a further set of \n      enhancements to support post-incident investigations. \n\nAmong the latest enhancements to the Verint Situational Awareness \n      Platform are Dispatch Manager, Mobile Reporter, and Mobile Responder. \n      These capabilities, along with Verint Situation Manager, work in \n      conjunction to provide information through integration with intelligent \n      sensors and data sources, including big data analysis, video \n      surveillance and crowdsourcing. \nDispatch Manager functionality incorporates emergency dispatch \n        into the Situational Awareness Platform, helping reduce emergency \n        response time, while enhancing end-to-end communications throughout an \n        incident, creating safer environments and optimizing incident \n        management. Mobile Reporter capabilities allow businesses, agencies and \n        local citizens to share information directly from their smart devices, \n        allowing multi-dimensional response and communication. Mobile Reporter \n        also can send emergency notifications based on the location of the \n        user. Mobile Responder functionality relays critical information and \n        multimedia data from an incident, providing field personnel with more \n        real-time, accurate intelligence about an incident before arriving \n        on-site. \n“Verint continues as a pioneering force in the area of situational \n      awareness, advancing capabilities to help organizations prepare for and \n      address their most critical monitoring, dispatch and incident response, \n      and field communications requirements,” says Steve Weller, senior vice \n      president and general manager, Verint Video and Situation Intelligence \n      Solutions ™ . \n\nAdds Weller, “With the Verint Situational Awareness Platform, \n      organizations can gain a unified view and stronger, more accurate \n      insights to drive real-time communication, multi-agency collaboration \n      and multi-directional response—and employ a more proactive approach to \n      security, safety and citizen engagement.” \n\nAbout Verint Systems Inc. \n\nVerint ® is a global leader in Actionable Intelligence ® , \n      which has become a necessity in a dynamic world of massive information \n      growth.

0975_40b907a8-d0cf-40e1-838d-61e10fcd1bbf	 \nJennifer Berson is the President & Founder of Jeneration PR, a Public Relations & Social Media Marketing firm specializing in promoting beauty, baby & lifestyle brands. Prior to founding Jeneration PR in 2005, Jennifer was a civil litigation attorney in Los Angeles. \n\nJennifer has been featured in the New York Times, Business Insider, Yahoo!, Entrepreneur Magazine, PR Week, Huffington Post, Fox 11 News, TV Guide Network's "Hollywood 411," PR Web and was profiled on Apple.com. Jennifer was also selected by Babble.com as one of the 10 "Mompreneur's Who Made it Big!" She lives in Sherman Oaks, California with her husband Kevin, a business broker and consultant, and their two boys, ages 3 and 5. \n\nHow has your life experience made you the leader you are today? \n\nI have always been very independent with the ability to entertain myself or work alone very efficiently--I think I get that from my mother who always manages to find something to do with her time. In high school, I won a leadership award in my senior year, not because I was student body president or in an obvious role as a leader, but because I was the class historian, and I worked independently, making sure to photograph every event. I ultimately created a scrapbook on my own without anyone telling me what had to be done. While that's not a leader in the "traditional" sense, having the drive to achieve a goal without being managed or guided by someone else does require leadership skills and encompasses the way I work today. My former career as a lawyer also taught me how to manage my time well, work efficiently, and handle all kinds of client personalities--these skills have all come in handy while leading my PR team and running my own business. \n\nHow has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Jeneration PR? \n\nPrior to starting my PR & social media marketing firm, I was a civil litigation attorney. While that career transition could be viewed as a complete 180, my background in law provided me with valuable skills that continue to serve me well in my PR career and as a business owner. In litigation, it's all about taking facts and crafting a story to best tell your side of the argument. In PR, we are essentially telling a brand's story, highlighting various facts & elements to best match our audience. Thanks to my law background, I developed sharp attention to detail and became an excellent writer. I can now see the bigger picture of how our PR services fit in to the overall growth strategy of a business. And if we're being completely honest, I know how to pursue clients who haven't paid their fees, so I have an excellent track record of collecting! Fortunately, this is a skill that I don't need to use too often. \n\nWhat have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Jeneration PR? \n\nThere have certainly been a few challenges--having to fire an account executive that was underperforming, managing & resetting clients' expectations when they are unrealistic, and accepting responsibility to our client when a member of my team makes a mistake. A specific challenge we overcame is that during the slow economy, I lost a few clients who couldn't afford our services. In order to prevent a catastrophic loss to our business, we were willing to work with clients, modifying rates to retain them and their business, cutting non-essential services to save them money. We focused on providing excellent service and value in order to help their businesses survive the slow economic climate, and when things bounced back, we were able to ramp up again to our regular level of engagement. \n\nIt's certainly more fun to reflect on the highlights than the challenges! I've had so many amazing experiences and career highlights during the last decade of running my business: I was profiled by Apple and featured on their website as an entrepreneur on-the-go using my Apple devices to stay connected and productive; I was selected by Babble.com as one of their "Top 10 Mompreneurs Who Made it Big!" and my home office received a gorgeous dream makeover, courtesy of HGTV. One day in particular that stands out as an absolutely incredible day was having TWO clients appear on the Ellen Degeneres Show and one of the TODAY Show, all on the same day! I was so incredibly proud and happy for my clients. \n\nHow are you marking the achievements of being in business for a decade? \n\nIt's been a ball celebrating our 10th year in business. I really can't believe how quickly a decade has flown by. I still enjoy what I do as much as I did when I first started, so I feel very fortunate about that. We've been sharing more tips and insider info through our newsletter and on Instagram, and we've stepped-up our marketing efforts around the #JENERAT10N hashtag, taking a look back at all of the best milestones and fun moments over the last decade. \n\nI am also working on developing comprehensive PR courses to help small brands learn all of the tricks of the trade so they can promote their businesses themselves. I am so excited to help many more business owners who are unable to afford a PR firm but who really deserve to have access to the media to share their great brands & products. \n\nWhat advice can you offer to women who are looking to follow a similar career path? \n\nMy path was certainly untraditional, but I learned some great lessons along the way. Before pursuing your own business, save up enough money in order to give yourself a long runway to make it happen. Also, consider trying to work in your new field for free--or for a very reduced rate--in order to gain experience, to see if you enjoy the work and to build up a body of work that you can use to showcase your talents. Finally, if you establish a company vs. putting yourself out there as a freelancer, you can ultimately charge more for your services. From the very beginning, I established Jeneration PR as an agency, even when it was just me. I always referred to the business as "we": "We can help you get great results," "We are excited about the opportunity to work together," "We have expertise in your industry...." This helps to build your reputation faster, and give you more credibility--and yes, charge higher rates--than if you are just an independent freelancer. \n\nHow do you maintain a work/life balance? \n\nThis is the $1Million question, isn't it? When I made the switch from my career in law to my own PR agency a decade ago, I was hoping to ultimately have more balance in my life and more time with my kids when I became a mom. While it's never easy to get everything done, and I still find myself working hard all of the time, I do feel that I have found more of the balance I was seeking and am very lucky to have a career where I'm still able to be part of my young children's lives--not because I've found the secret to attaining "work/life balance," but because I'm gentle with myself, accept my limitations, and give my sole attention to whatever (work) or whomever (my husband & my kids) needs it at any given moment. \n\nAs working moms (and dads), it's all too easy to get caught up in the idea that you don't have enough--or, more often, that you aren't giving enough--to every area of your life. I try to cut myself some slack. \n\nInstead of beating yourself up over everything you're not doing, try to remember that you're doing the best you can with what you have. Just changing your mental script can be so powerful. Replace the negative messages you are sending yourself with positive affirmations, and you'll likely accomplish more in work and life than you thought was possible. \n\nMaybe some people truly feel balanced in their work and their personal lives all the time--but I don't know any of those people. Even those who seem like they have it all together will tell you they have their own struggles. Nothing or nobody is perfect, myself included--and I try my best daily to be ok with that. \n\nInstead of constantly seeking a perfect 50/50 balance between the work that I do and the life that I lead, instead I make a commitment to stay present and focused on wherever I am and whatever needs my attention in a…
0976_780ec73a-9edc-49c0-8d8b-0815e38e30ef	Whenever we do a Real Housewives “Where Are They Now?” story it’s usually not a happy ending, and it often involves a mug shot photo, foreclosure, and/or bankruptcy. But, for The Real Housewives of New York City OGs Alex McCord and Simon van Kempen, their post-Bravo fairy tale is one that is both a happy ending and wtf-worthily interesting! Just to get you caught up, Simon and Alex left RHONY in 2011 after four seasons. They were part of Bravo’s complete overhaul of the cast that also saw the departure of Jill Zarin, Kelly Bensimon, and Cindy Barshop. “Alex and I are sad that it’s come to this,” Simon said in a statement after the firings were confirmed by Bravo. “We had a great four years. We don’t intend for this to be the final time you’ll see us on television.” And it wasn’t the final time fans got to see Alex and Simon on television. In July of 2012 it was announced that they would appear on the second season of VH1’s Couples Therapy with Dr. Jenn. Since their appearance on Couples Therapy, Alex and Simon stayed away from the small screen for the most part, and the absence helped them gain a little perspective on their experience. “Although they’re reality shows, they swallow up your life and they become your reality,” Alex said in an interview with ABC North Coast NSW in June, “and then all of a sudden you don’t want to walk away from it because it’s such a big part of your life.” Simon added, “One thing a lot of people don’t realize is how much the show can take over one’s life and it defines you and there’s a struggle to break free from that.” So, late last year, the couple made a very bold decision to return to Simon’s home of New South Wales, Australia! The couple sold their 2.6 million dollar, six-bedroom, five bathroom townhouse in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill and, in January, the family of four moved into their beautiful new home in the Ballina Shire village of Newrybar. Here’s a photo of their new digs (at least for one year) courtesy of Alex: Presenting….our new home! She's a beautiful old Queenslander and ours for the next year. A photo posted by Alex McCord (@mccordalex) on Jan 15, 2015 at 4:20pm PST And how about that view?! First order of business in the new house? Testing out the pool. Of course! Last day of summer; school starts tomorrow! A photo posted by Alex McCord (@mccordalex) on Jan 26, 2015 at 4:58pm PST Alex explained their decision to relocate to Australia in a letter to The Dish in September of last year: After 18 years in New York for Alex, and 28 years outside Australia for Simon, we’ve made the decision to move to Australia to be with family. Over the last few years, all of Simon’s family have reconvened from as far as Europe to all live within 20 minutes of each other on a collection of beautiful beaches on the north coast of New South Wales. We are the last of the family to move back, and it’s time. Our children have never had the opportunity to live within walking distance of grandparents and cousins, and with our two boys aged 8 and 10 it’s the perfect time for the extended family to enjoy each other. We both love New York City, and Brooklyn specifically, almost as much as each other; however, we’ve been there, done that and written the book—literally—on raising Little Kids in the Big City. It’s now time for a new adventure. We both firmly believe that change is necessary in order to grow, and to do that, we need to get out of our comfort zone. When we realized that we’d quit traveling because New York was so comfortable and had everything we need, when we realized our 8 year old had only ever lived in one house—we realized it was time. So what are Simon, 51, and Alex, 42, planning on doing to make ends meet? That is perhaps my favorite part of the story! Simon has traded in his reality show stardom and has opened a law firm with his brother! WHUH?!? The firm, called van Kempen & Associates, opened in July and focuses on property law and conveyancing. (Conveyancing is the transfer of legal title of property from one person to another, or the granting of an encumbrance such as a mortgage or a lien.) Here is a photo of the firm’s storefront followed by a description of the firm from their website: Van Kempen & Associates Conveyancing and Property Law combines the experience of brothers Adam van Kempen, principal of long established Byron Bay law firm BvK Pty Ltd, and Simon van Kempen harnessing their legal expertise and business acumen to Tweed Shire. Operating out of the Tweed Heads CBD, van Kempen & Associates provides expert Conveyancing Servicing and Property Law advice to the Tweed Coast, Gold Coast and surrounding hinterland. Here’s an ad for van Kempen & Associates from the Tweed Daily news in August, 2015: Alex and Simon’s two sons, Francois, 11, and Johan, 9, appear to be handling the international transition well. Here they are in their school uniforms: “We’re really enjoying our time here and have made lovely friends, and the boys are close to their cousins and grandparents which is what we wanted for them,” Alex told the Gold Coast Bulletin this week. And speaking of Alex, she’s not resting on her laurels. She is reportedly studying psychology with plans to write a thesis on reality television. Congratulations to both Simon and Alex! I’m guessing it goes against everything they are trying to do, but I would sure tune in if Bravo had a Simon & Alex Down Under reality series. Or maybe The Real Housewives of Byron Bay?

We have most likely the best coffee culture in the world, but there was nothing in terms of milk designed to go with it. So we decided to invent it."\n\nThe key factors that cause soy and almond milk to curdle are the high acidity of black coffee and temperature. The coffee acts as a coagulant, causing the milk to split and curdle in a cup.\n\nFreedom will not reveal the secrets of some its blends. "I can tell you, getting almond milk not to split, or getting soy milk not to split and curdle when you add very hot coffee, is no easy task," De Blasio said. "It has taken us over a year. We have adjusted calcium levels, added some natural vegetable gums. The end result is we have range of milks that are perfectly matched to the acidity of high-quality espresso coffee."\n\nTo get the blends right, the MILKLAB project engaged the help of baristas in Australia and around the world, including Melbourne's Gem Fusca from Percy's Aeroplane Cafe in Kew, China's Andy Lu and Instagram's @latteartporn barista Matthew Lakejev from Sydney, whose displays of latte art have garnered him a social media following of more than 14,000.\n\n"They will not split no matter what kind of coffee or roast you throw at them," said Fusca. "I have never encountered non-dairy milks like it."\n\nThe new range of products includes milks made from soy, almond and coconut milk, as well as a lactose-free dairy milk.\n\nMILKLAB was launched at a party for 1000 latte lovers in Sydney on Friday. The story first appeared on Good Food.
0981_7b29861d-746b-450e-b9e5-52db4d17b15e	When Ilma Lopez decided to organize a fundraiser for the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital , she didn’t set out to ask only female chefs to participate. \n \n“These women, I think they’re amazing,” she said. “They’re people who it’s a no-brainer for me to work with. I’m serious. It just so happens that they’re all female.” \n \nLopez and at least one of the other chefs have had family members hospitalized during the past year, an experience that opened their eyes to the importance of having quality healthcare in the community, and resources for families trying to cope with serious illness or injury. In Lopez’s case, it was her husband and business partner Damian Sansonetti. \n \n“You’re just like what the heck happened? And everything stopped,” she said. “You keep doing your day to day, but you don’t realize how hard it is until you’re the person at 3 a.m. in the hallway, waiting for someone to tell you what’s going on.” \n \nIn Krista Desjarlais’ case, it was her daughter Cortland, who had an unexpected seizure and was diagnosed with benign partial epilepsy, a condition that is expected to last into her teenage years. Desjarlais and her husband, Erik, spent three months visiting doctors and hospitals. \n \n“We saw so many children who were far worse off than Cortland,” Desjarlais said. “You realize how important funding is.” \n \nLopez’s daughter Isabella was also part of the inspiration for choosing the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital to be the recipient of the Fabulous Femmes fundraiser . Lopez, a native of Venezuela, can’t show her daughter her home country because of political unrest, \n \n“I want to create a better community where Isabella can always come back home,” Lopez said. “I want Isabella to always have that. The only way I can create that is if it’s me doing something.” \n \nAlex Wight, creator of the Flanagan’s Table dinners in Buxton, donated the venue. Tabitha Perry of Crush Distributors will provide the wine, and Briana Volk of Portland Hunt & Alpine Club will be mixing cocktails. Lopez is hoping this $150-per-plate dinner will be the first of many; she hopes to start a nonprofit organization that will run future culinary fundraisers for the children’s hospital. She’d like to include in those events former patients and their families who can speak to diners about their experiences at the hospital. \n \n“We’re so lucky to have a place like that in Maine for our kids,” Lopez said. “I don’t want to use it, but how lucky are we?”

0983_d5d7cd17-a82b-4b9e-b94a-68d2598435e9	MAPPING THE ISRAELI NETWORK BEHIND THE JFK ASSASSINATION By Michael Collins Piper The State of Israel had integral llinks with all of  the major power groups that wanted John F. Kennedy removed from the American presidency. Israel’s global network had the power to orchestrate not only the assassination of Kennedy, but also the subsequent cover-up. Israel was indeed a key player in the JFK assassination conspiracy and, the evidence suggests, a primary instigator of the crime.\nAll of Israel’s co-conspirators—and those who had an interest in seeing Kennedy dead—had good reason to assist in the cover-up. They were protecting their own interests. By 1963, John F. Kennedy had made many enemies. His brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s prosecutions of Mafia and Meyer Lansky-bossed Organized Crime figures had many in the crime syndicate very angry, to say the least. The early stages for the prosecution of Meyer Lansky himself were already underway. A case had already been made against Lansky’s New Orleans front man Carlos Marcello.Lansky’s West Coast henchman Mickey Cohen had been targeted as well\nTHE ISRAELI-CONNECTED LANSKY SYNDICATE Lansky was the ultimate target: the enmity between the Kennedy family and Meyer Lansky went back decades. Not only was the President’s father, Joseph P. Kennedy considered an enemy of the Jewish people, but he was also believed by Lansky to hold a grudge against him (Lansky) because of a Lansky-orchestrated hijacking of one of Kennedy Sr.’s illicit whiskey running deals. Considering John F. Kennedy’s secret alliance with the mob during the 1960 campaign, his war against Lansky’s underworld syndicate was a double-cross that could not be tolerated.\nLyndon johnson The president was also planning to drop his Vice President, Lyndon Johnson, from the 1964 ticket. It was possible that Johnson—long financed politically by Lansky and his New Orleans Mafia henchman, Carlos Marcello—could end up spending the remainder of his years in prison. The Kennedy brothers were interested in Johnson’s deals conducted through his front man, Bobby Baker, who later did end up in prison. Baker, of course, conducted several of his major deals with Lansky associates, including Ed Levinson, a director of the Mossad-linked Banque de Credit International, founded by former Mossad official Tibor Rosenbaum.\nTHE ANTI-CASTRO CUBANS What’s more, Kennedy was preparing for a rapprochement with Castro’s Cuba and therefore the Lansky syndicate would not be able to re-invigorate its massive gambling interests there as a consequence. The change in Cuban policy was also distressing to the anti-Castro Cuban community in Miami, New Orleans and elsewhere. \nThe anti-Castro Cubans had, of course, been cooperating closely with the Lansky syndicate in anti-Castro activities. Likewise, the new Cuban policy enraged the CIA which was the primary sponsor of the anti-Castro forces. As we have also seen, the Mossad played a major (although little-known) part in the intrigue involving the anti-Castro Cubans through its base in Miami.\nTHE CIA JFK had other problems with the CIA. He was making moves to dismantle the CIA and was engaged in a secret war with that agency stemming from his clear intent to withdraw U.S. forces from Vietnam. This would have been a major blow to the so-called “military-industrial complex” (of which the Israeli lobby was a major component) that stood to make immense profits from a continuing U.S. presence in Southeast Asia.\nHOOVER above – John Kennedy and his brother Rob. Both were kicking ass and taking names – they paid the price for trying to take on the Illuminati Jewish Central Banking Cartel and their myriad of lackeys infested in government. Ultimately, Kennedy planned to merge all of the American intelligence agencies—the FBI included—into a single entity under his brother Robert’s direction. This plan, of course, was not greeted enthusiastically by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover whom Kennedy also planned to dethrone following the 1964 election. Hoover, as we have seen, had his own secret arrangements with Lansky, individually, and with organized crime in general. Hoover also had a foundation established in his name with funding from Lansky-linked liquor industries and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) of B’nai B’rith, which functions as a de facto U.S. propaganda and intelligence arm of Israel’s Mossad. If Hoover himself did not actively conspire against the life of John F. Kennedy, he certainly looked the other way if he knew a conspiracy to assassinate JFK had been hatched.\nVIETNAM & DRUGS Kennedy’s intended change in Vietnam policy—his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the imbroglio—infuriated not only the CIA but elements in the Pentagon and their allies in the military-industrial complex. By thistime, of course, the Lansky syndicate had already set up international heroinrunning from Southeast Asia through the CIA-linked Corsican Mafia in the  Mediterranean. The joint Lansky-CIA operations in the international drug racket were a lucrative venture that thrived as a consequence of deep U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia as cover for the drug smuggling activities. We know today that the Mossad has emerged as a major player as a “middleman” in much of this drug-smuggling activity.\nISRAEL, THE CIA & THE LANSKY SYNDICATE John F. Kennedy’s bitter behind-the-scenes conflict with Israel brought him into combat with an ally of not only the CIA but also the Lansky syndicate, both of which entities also maintained intimate connections to the anti-Castro Cubans. Vice President Lyndon Johnson’s Lansky-Mafia and defense industry ties, coupled with his close relationship to the Israeli lobby, and his long-standing friendly dealings with both the CIA and Hoover’s FBI made Johnson an acceptable alternative (among these diverse special interests) to a Kennedy dynasty. Kennedy himself had long been suspect in the eyes of Israel and its allies as we saw in Chapter 4.\nWe also now know that even the famed “Chicago Mafia” under Sam Giancana was heavily immersed in wide-ranging international dealings with Israel’s Mossad—largely through the good offices of the real boss of the Chicago syndicate, Meyer Lansky’s partner-in-crime, Hyman Lamer. So the theory that even “the Chicago Mafia killed JFK”—we find—has a very distinct “Mossad connection” beyond any doubt.\nMICKEY COHEN As early as 1960 (as we documented in Chapter 13), Meyer Lansky’s West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, was using Kennedy’s filmland bedpartner, actress Marilyn Monroe, as a conduit for attempting to learn Kennedy’s intentions toward Israel. Kennedy’s introduction to Miss Monroe by one of Cohen’s associates, we have learned, was for this very purpose, and also, perhaps, for ultimately blackmailing JFK. Although “official” history acknowledges the president’s stormy affair with Miss Monroe, its real origins—and the intent for which it was orchestrated—have been covered up and forgotten.\nabove – poor marilyn was used and abused by the jews in the hollywood and the mossad connected Meyer Lansky crime syndicate – she was killed so she would never be able to spill the beans on how the jews used her to pump info out of JFK regarding his stance towards ISrael (“Official” history would have us remember—instead—Kennedy’s other widely-publicized illicit relationship with Judith Campbell, mistress of Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana.) Cohen, a long-standing disciple of Israel and one of its earliest adherents, had more than a passing interest in the Middle East state. According to one account, we have discovered, Cohen was less than happy with Kennedy’s stance toward Israel.\nBEN-GURION AND THE ISRAELI NUCLEAR BOMB By April 1963, Kennedy’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and the state of Israel was at a dangerous impasse, particularly over Israel’s determination to develop a nuclear bomb. At Kennedy’s last official press conference, he bemoaned the Israeli lobby’s deliberate sabotage of his own efforts to build bridges to the Arab world. Little did JFK know that the seeds of his own destruction had been sown as a consequence of his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East Israeli leader David Ben-Gurion had developed an intense personal distrust—even hatred and contempt—for Kennedy.\nHe believed that Kennedy’s presidency was a danger to the very survival of the state of Israel—the nation that Ben-Gurion had helped create. Ben-Gurion, by this time, was consumed with paranoia. He believed that Israel might be destroyed. It was because of his contempt for Kennedy and the American president’s stance toward Israel that Ben-Gurion left his post as prime minister. It is likely that his last act as prime minister was to order Mossad orchestration of a hit on John F. Kennedy. We have learned that it was then-Mossad assassination team chief Yitzhak Shamir who took care of the arrangements necessary to set the conspiracy in motion. Shamir knew, of course, that a diverse array of interests—domestic and international—would like to see Kennedy removed from the White House.\nThere were a variety of components that could be put together to ensure a successful assassination conspiracy: specifically the Mossad-linked Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate as well as the CIA, and the elements in their spheres of influence. Was there a code name for the conspiracy against President Kennedy? More than likely. But we, of course, will surely never know its name. Did the Mossad, perhaps, call it “Operation Haman”—naming the conspiracy to kill the American president after Haman, the ancient Amalekite conspirator who desired the destruction of the Jewish people? That code name would be as reasonable as any, considering Ben-Gurion’s hatred for Kennedy—a modern-day Haman in his eyes.\nTHE CONSPIRACY IS SET IN MOTION A network of assassin recruitment and planning was set in motion through the aegis of the Mossad-CIA-Lansky combine, with the shadowy Permindex entity at the very center of the operation. All stood to benefit from John F. Kennedy’s removal from office. Many people on the periphery of the conspiracy—indeed, perhaps even many of those at the center—did not know how or why they were being directed to undertake many of the actions that they did that advanced the ultimate aim of removing JFK from the White House.\n(G.P.J.''\n(G.P.J.''''.J.P.G)\nMichael Collins Piper: FINAL JUDGEMENT lecture [Mossad connection to JFK Conspir

0986_67e8bfc6-da54-4b83-ad87-120c45c1115d	(Photo: Contributed) \n\nJudaism’s holiest time of the year begins Sunday night, but something special will be held Saturday afternoon in Montgomery with a program focusing on two men named Abraham who figured prominently in Alabama history. \n\nAbraham Mordecai is believed to have been one of the first white residents in the territory from which Alabama was carved while Abraham Joshua Heschel took part in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge after “Bloody Sunday” in 1965. \n\nThe event, which is called “Redigging the Wells of Two Modern Jewish Patriarchs,” begins at 1 p.m. and continues through the afternoon at River City Church at 301 Dexter Ave. where attendees will have an opportunity to learn more about the two historic figures and their contributions to the state. \n\nTemple Beth Or Rabbi Elliot Stevens has described Heschel as “one of the great philosophers and theologians of the 20th century, someone who “transcended denominational boundaries.” \n\n“His books are universally admired and he was considered a great spiritual leader during his lifetime,” Stevens said. \n\nSusannah Heschel, the late rabbi’s daughter, is a noted Dartmouth College scholar where she is professor of Jewish Studies. She will speak at the church at 2 p.m. \n\nPaul Hughes of Birmingham, who helped organize “Redigging The Wells Selma,” a 22-day prayer initiative culminating with an event last April linked to Passover, said Saturday’s program is a free educational event. \n\n“It is for the general public honoring two modern Jewish “Abrahams” who made profound historical and spiritual contributions to Alabama,” said Hughes. \n\nBorn in 1755 in Philadelphia, Pa., Abraham Mordecai was a Jewish pioneer and Indian trader believed to have been the first of his religion to become involved in events that shaped the Southeast including Alabama before statehood. \n\nHe maintained a good relationship with Indian tribes in the region and married a Creek woman. He and his family moved to an area known as Holy Ground along the banks of the Alabama River around 1819—the year Alabama was admitted to the Union. He died in 1850. \n\nWhen Alabama State Troopers and Dallas County sheriff’s deputies routed hundreds of peaceful black protesters on the Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. issued a call for ministers to come to Selma to take part in a march to Montgomery two weeks later to seek equal voting rights for blacks. \n\nHeschel, born in Poland in 1907, was descended from a prominent European family of rabbis and quickly established himself as one of Europe’s leading Jewish theologians. He had help in leaving Poland and coming to America as the Nazis overran the country but most members of his family died in the Holocaust. \n\nHe authored several widely read books on Jewish Philosophy and became involved in the civil rights movement, establishing a close friendship with King who placed him in the front row of prominent of marchers crossing the bridge on March 21, 1965. \n\nWant to go? \n\nWHAT: Redigging The Wells \n\nWHERE: River City Church, 301 Dexter Ave. in Montgomery \n\nWHEN: Saturday \n\n• 1 p.m. Remembering Rabbi Abraham Heschel (1907-1972) \n\nTheologian, philosopher, author and friend of Rev.

It usually occurs in the early autumn and is a two-day celebration for traditional Jews. Reform Jews usually observe it for one day. \n\nThe first major Jewish holiday of the year is 5776. It is said to be the anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman and their first actions toward the realization of humanity’s role in God’s world. Customs include sounding the shofar, a hollowed-out ram’s horn and eating symbolic foods such as apples dipped in honey to evoke a “sweet new year.” \n\nYOM KIPPUR: Regarded as the “Sabbath of Sabbaths,” Yom Kippur is the most solemn day in Judaism, a day in which Jews seek forgiveness of their sins from God. According to Jewish tradition, God inscribes each person’s fate during Rosh Hashanah for the coming year into the “Book of Life.” \n\nJews try to amend their behavior and seek forgiveness for wrongs done against God and those they may have harmed. The day is filled with private petitions and confessions of guilt. At the end of the day, they hope that they have been forgiven by God. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1EZxTsf
0987_b1ccb02d-a55d-4eb0-aa75-53aa63955167	As we continue to celebrate Dine Out for No Kid Hungry Month , Share Our Strength supporter chef Jason Alley, co-owner of Comfort , which just marked its 13 th year in business, and Pasture restaurants in Richmond, Virginia, discusses his experiences with childhood hunger, why school breakfast and lunch should be available to all students, and the worst thing you can donate to a food bank. \n \nYou faced food insecurity regularly as a child. How did that affect your everyday life? \n \nIt creates massive stress. I grew up in southwest Virginia around the Appalachian Mountains, and we were certainly not alone in being poor in that area. There’s a lot of poverty. Food was always scarce. Growing up rural was nice because we had plenty of friends that hunted, and my grandmother had a garden, but that didn’t always make the cut. So food was always first and foremost on our minds all the time, like, how are we gonna make this happen? How are we going to get everybody fed? \n \nCan you remember some of the toughest periods? \n \nThere were many times when I moved to Florida with my mom when there were weeks and weeks in which it was literally school lunch and white rice at home. That would just be it for extended periods of time. \n \nAs a child, how did you sit through school and succeed when you’re so undernourished? \n \nI didn’t really succeed. I was unmotivated to be at school. Think about if you’re sitting at your desk and you had to skip breakfast, and now it’s lunchtime. You bottom out. You find yourself dozing off at your desk. You get hangry and cranky. Now, imagine that being a habitual thing. To think anyone is going to be successful under those circumstances is just unreasonable. \n \nThe free breakfast and lunch programs that a lot of schools have gone to are crucial in setting the stage for success for these kids. Our kids are starting public middle school for the first time this year, and their school has free breakfast and free lunch for every kid in the school. \n \nWhen it’s available to everyone, I would imagine there is less of a stigma. \n \nWhen I was a kid I had my little free lunch card. You’re going through puberty, kids are already starting to get bullied, you don’t have the cool clothes, and now, oh yeah, here’s your poor kid card. Have a great day! That’s just an added stressor. I think it is really progressive for a school to alleviate that stress. You know what? It’s free for everybody. Nobody pays, nobody gets singled out. \n \n\n \nWere there other resources to help you and your family? \n \nWe benefited from local food banks and a lot of church food closets. There were plenty of days where we would have been even hungrier had that not been available. \n \nI feel like it’s hard for some people to take that step and go to food pantries, as if there were shame in it. \n \nWe’re a shaming culture. We’re really good at it. If you’re hungry and you need help, there’s nothing wrong with that. It sucks to feel as though you have to ask for charity, but it’s more important to look at the positives it brings. It makes everybody feel good. I don’t think there’s anybody who’s working at or going to a food pantry or food bank that is going to be looking down their nose at you. It’s a shared experience. If you can accept the help for what it is, which is help and generosity, and you can use that to get yourself moving forward, then everything is working how it’s supposed to work. \n \nBeing surrounded by the bounty of food you are able to serve, are you ever conflicted? \n \nSometimes there’s a little bit of an esoteric dilemma because I know about hunger, and I know that there are tons and tons of people in that situation. I provide for my family by providing what is really a luxury service. On our best days, though, we also provide a place for people to get together and enjoy one another and have these special occasions. And it’s fantastic, but there are those days where you’re like, man, here I am selling $25 entrees and there’s a kid who’s not eating today aside from a free lunch at school. It’s a constant concern, and we are firm believers in utilizing everything we possibly can, out of respect for the animal that gave its life to the farmer that grew produce, and then obviously to be respectful to people who don’t have the opportunity to come in and drop fifty bucks on dinner. But, what we do has given us the opportunity give back a bit, which I think is super important. \n \nChefs and restaurateurs are always being approached for charitable endeavors, and it seems they usually find a way to say yes. \n \nThe restaurant industry as a whole is a very charity conscious industry. People definitely give until it hurts. It’s interesting because it’s not an industry that’s known for super-high profit margins, but we still always find a way to do these little things to help out when we can. \n \nI know that for me, a lot of that is a sense of responsibility. And, it just feels good that through all your hard work you are able to contribute something. \n \nHow did you come to be involved with Share Our Strength and No Kid Hungry? \n \nWhen I was in Atlanta, we did work with Share Our Strength – that was about fifteen years ago – and I was really blown away. It is such a great charity. And then when we moved to Virginia, they didn’t yet have a huge presence. So when we started to focus our charity efforts on anti-hunger campaigns, we started doing it locally and very grassroots. In Richmond, we have an anti-hunger umbrella company called Feedmore that does backpack programs, community kitchens, food banks, and meals on wheels and they are very efficient. \n \nAnd, when our current governor, Terry McAuliffe, was elected, his wife, Dorothy, really took up the mantle of childhood hunger and food insecurity as her push. So, that’s created a lot of opportunities to get more of these Share Our Strength events here. We’re in constant talks with them to try to get more events set up. They’re an amazing organization. \n \nIn addition to participating in Dine Out for No Kid Hungry Month, what can people do to join the fight against childhood hunger? \n \nTake time and go to your local food bank and drop some money there. Not just a can of crappy creamed corn that you don’t want that’s been in your cabinet for the last three years. Give them some loot or take three hours and go and volunteer and do some work. It’s great to donate food to pantries, but the impact that time and money provides is important. If you volunteer, it gives you a more tangible sense of what that is. And I think that most people who get involved in a program like that stay involved. \n \nIf you do donate food, we encourage people to go buy things that are easy and self-contained. Don’t give boxes of dried macaroni and cheese because I remember as a kid getting that, but then we didn’t have any milk and we didn’t have any butter. So now you’ve got crappy noodles and water and cheese powder. Buy the one with the squeeze pack, and you can feed two to three people out of that box and it’s there and it’s done. The local food banks here are also really pushing produce and fresh produce. And, that’s hard for an individual to donate, so that’s where those cash donations really come into play. \n \nSpeaking of mac and cheese, there can be a tendency for people of privilege to look down on food choices being made by those for whom hunger is an issue. \n \nYou might see poor people buying crappy food. And some of that is time, and some of it is education. What people don’t think about are the far-reaching implications. If you’re so impoverished that you can’t afford food for your family, you’re not on the internet looking up recipes on how to use kale. You don’t have a computer. You don’t have the Internet. People who are sitting in judgment aren’t thinking about how devastating that overall level of poverty is. And that’s why these education programs are key. Creating recipes for fresh food so that when people do get it they know what to do with it; it doesn’t sit on the counter and rot. \n \nWhat people don’t realize is that you can still get a $5 fast-food combo meal and it’s just done and you’re full. Can you buy some pork and pinto beans and cucumbers for that same amount and still have a great meal? Sure. But do you have those three hours to cook a pot of pinto beans? \n \nWe sit in our towers and judge them. Like, oh, we feel great about ourselves because look at what we’re using from our CSA boxes and these poor people are still eating McDonalds. Don’t they know? And they don’t. Or they know and they don’t see another option that works for them. They’re doing the best they can. We have to change the way we look at that. \n \nThere’s a lot of talk about the death of the family dinner in our society, and it feels like hunger likely plays a role in that. \n \nWhen you’re sitting down as a parent and you realize that you don’t have enough food to go around for everybody, it’ s just a crushing sense of defeat and failure. And it’s hard to be loving around the table when all you’re seeing is your inability to provide. \n \nThat’s part of the thing that creates this cycle of failure. When you feel like a failure, it’s not motivating. I don’t know how we fix that without some serious income redistribution. I do think that the real base fix is making sure that people aren’t hungry. If you’re hungry, you’re not thinking straight. You’re pissed off. You’re tired. Your health fails. You’re sick. That’s not exactly how you go out and get it together and make it all happen. It’s hard to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when you don’t have the strength to do it. \n \nMake a reservation to support Dine Out for No Kid Hungry Month , and join Team No Kid Hungry to help connect children in need with healthful meals.  \n \nThe post Chef Jason Alley on Growing up with Food Insecurity + Why #NoKidHungry Matters More Than Ever appeared first on OpenTable Blog .
0988_54ce3f1c-7c7f-439d-a30c-58d4bc51e603	Their relationship dates back 20 years, when both Frank Zurek and Larry Scott were work colleagues at Amoco Corporation and began going to lunch together, sometimes as often as four times per week. That friendship developed into something deeper and they then began having drinks and dinners after work. \n\nNeither was out at work, so they didn't come out to each other for months. \n\n\nThen one day, while having drinks together after work at The North End in Lakeview, each admitted he was gay. \n\n\n"I don't recall where the first real dinner date was, but it was downtown after work and Frank ordered calamari," Scott said. "That fact alone guaranteed I wanted a second date because I'm an adventurous eater. This was in January 1996; by Valentine's Day, we considered ourselves a couple." \n\n\nFast-forward to Sept. 12, 2015, to a short walk to the lakefront from North End, or Cell Block, where they also frequented in the mid-1990s. More importantly, there was also the famous totem pole near Addison Street. \n\n\n"The primary significance is that [the totem pole] is where we meet with the Frontrunners/Frontwalkers each week. Second as native Chicagoans, the lakefront is symbolic of the city and certainly a beautiful place to have a wedding ceremony. And, the totem pole is in Boystown, and we gay men, [so] it symbolizes the social aspect of our living in Chicago," Scott said. \n\n\nCheers followed the short morning ceremony, officiated by Judge James E. Snyder, who also is a runner in training for a marathon. \n\n\n"Although we thought about having the ceremony in Florida, [where we now are living, except for the summers in Chicago, but] we have family and friends in Chicago where we had lived our entire lives before we moved to Florida in 2009," Scott said. "We decided that we would get married in Chicago and only wanted to have a small civil ceremony, but we wanted to include our family and friends from the Chicago area." \n\n\nZurek added, "Although we did not want to do anything very elaborate, we were certainly not averse to something different and unique. The one idea that seemed to grab us was the thought of holding the ceremony at the totem pole, where we walk [from] twice a week with the Chicago Frontrunners/Frontwalkers while we are in Chicago during the summer. We thought about the best time for the ceremony, [be it] before or after the run, and decided that before would be best since everyone would be there and fresh before the run." \n\n\nThey ran the idea past David Reithoffer, president of Chicago Frontrunners, so he could check with the Board and make sure the idea would be acceptable. "When he gave us the approval, we had a week to throw the event together," Scott said. \n\n\nZurek, 66, originally retired in 2008 and then formally retired in 2014 from Acro Staffing as a consultant, IT procurement. Scott, 61, retired as an IT manager from INEOS Corporation in 2009. \n\n\nThey live in Wilton Manors, Florida, when not in Chicago. \n\n\nThe couple went on a traditional walk after their vows, photos and more celebratory cheers. \n\n\nScott and Zurek had matching shirts and shorts, with their Frontrunners/Frontwalkers running shirts underneath that went on display after they were pronounced husband and husband. \n\n\nBoth noted that the predominantly gay Frontrunners/Frontwalkers provides an opportunity to meet other LGBT on a social level, as well as providing regular exercise. "The group is quite diverse and we enjoy conversing with the members during social events and dinners and breakfast," Scott said. "We have developed great friendships with some of the members who have come down to visit us in Florida during the winter. And some of our Florida Frontrunners have visited us in Chicago during the summer as well." \n\n\nZurek added, "Certainly when I was coming-out as a young man in Chicago, I never envisioned that one day we would actually be able to get married. I feel that I was fortunate living in Chicago where an active GLBT community was evolving. Although Larry and I have now been together almost 20 years, it seems only right to formalize our relationship and call each other 'husband.'"

0990_838defd8-c053-4f9b-9e33-b11b2ba899e0	(CNN) -  \nA Chinese military jet performed an "unsafe" maneuver in front of a U.S. reconnaissance plane last week, the Pentagon said Tuesday. \n \nThe announcement came the same day that China's President, promoting peace and downplaying differences, arrived in Seattle to start a potentially pivotal U.S. visit. \n\nA U.S. RC-135 aircraft operating above the Yellow Sea, approximately 80 miles east of the Shandong Peninsula, reported the September 15 incident after the Chinese jet passed in front of the RC-135, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters. \n\n"One of the maneuvers conducted by the Chinese aircraft during this intercept was perceived as unsafe by the RC-135 air crew and at this point, right now, there's no indication this was a near collision, but the report that came back was that the plane operated in an unsafe fashion," Cook said. \n\nThe intercept follows a more dangerous maneuver last year when an armed Chinese fighter jet came within approximately 20 feet of a U.S. Navy P-8 aircraft, at one point rolling to its side to show the U.S. plane its weapons load, Pentagon officials said at the time. \n\nWhile last week's incident was not seen of as provocative, Cook said the incident was still under review. \n\nIt's already rankled some in Washington. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the "dangerous Chinese intercept of a U.S. aircraft last week shows that China feels emboldened to continue its pattern of aggressive behavior in the Asia-Pacific region." \n\nThe tables have turned before: In May China's navy issued warnings eight times as a U.S. surveillance plane swooped over islands that Beijing has claimed over its neighbors' opposition. And two years ago, two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers flew through air space claimed by China. \n\nFrom Beijing's perspective, the timing of Tuesday's announcement from the Pentagon certainly could have been better. President Xi Jinping is in the United States and will have an official state visit Friday with his American counterpart, Barack Obama. \n\nIn a written interview with the Wall Street Journal, Xi downplayed differences between the two countries, saying "even family members don't always see eye to eye with each other." \n\nAs to China possibly flexing its military muscles, the President insisted his country's approach is "defensive in nature." \n\n"In strengthening our defense and military,... we are not going after some kind of military adventure," Xi said. "It never crosses my mind."

0992_3187a4e9-0163-4411-9650-43ef00129884	By Wednesday, September 2nd, 2015 \n    \nBy Mohammed Fahad Al-Harthi \n \nThe first official visit of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman to Washington beginning on Thursday comes at a crucial time in the history of Saudi-US relations. \n \nMuch anticipation surrounds the visit which will see a number of sensitive issues being brought to the table. It is no secret that Saudi-US differences have affected the region. The American mistake in Iraq and Washington’s pointless and naive withdrawal pushing the country into the Iranian swamp is one example. \n \nOther issues such as the Saudi-US disagreement regarding the June 30, 2013, events in Egypt, the shameful retraction of President Obama’s red line on the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the settlement afterward have also led to the two countries drifting apart. The situation has been worsened by the Iranian nuclear agreement that poses more questions than answers. \n \nProbably the most important question is whether our problem with Iran is limited to the nuclear deal. Many feel that the problem has its roots in Iran’s political policies in the region. Tehran seems to insist on intervening in internal Arab affairs and inciting sectarianism in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Yemen. \n \nWhile Riyadh and other Gulf capitals voice reservations, Washington is busy working for the agreement. Internally, the deal must be approved by Congress and externally, the Americans must keep other countries convinced of the deal’s importance. The Gulf states have made their position and desires clear: A region free of nuclear weapon and free of political conflicts, wars and militias — all of which are linked to Iran. \n \nSaudis recognize the strategic value and importance of the bilateral relations between Riyadh and Washington. As relations have stretched over a long history of ups and downs, the foundation and shared interests of the two countries have met all challenges. This has been particularly true when, on numerous occasions, Saudi-US relations have served as the region’s safety valve. \n \nSaudis stress the importance of the strategic relationship for both countries, acknowledging that disagreements arise from time to time. Washington has sought Saudi wisdom and experience many times since it knows that the Kingdom is a country with balanced and credible political thought which rejects extremism. This translates into both countries needing each other. \n \nThe claims that the declining US interest in Saudi oil negatively affects the alliance are short-sighted. Saudi Arabia is not a barrel of oil but an influential country, a great economic power and member of the G-20. Shared interests thus override the points of dispute. \n \nKing Salman, a veteran decision-maker and the experienced consultant of previous Saudi rulers, understands the importance of bilateral relations. Just as we saw in Operation Decisive Storm, he can be firm and take the initiative, knowing that Arabs can protect their interests in the region and will not acquiesce in the face of expansionist powers. \n \nIn diplomatic relations between countries, respect is for the powerful. And power means not only military force but also the ability to influence and build political alliances. In this context, the Gulf system remains one of the most influential forces in the region, led by the highest-level coordination between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \n \nThe two countries filled the vacuum in the Arab political system and, with their alliance with Egypt, can save the region and prevent chaos. Once they share a political position, they have an influence on major powers. \n \nWashington knows that Saudi Arabia has launched a war on terror and the Saudi security forces’ success confirm Riyadh’s role. Only a few days ago, it arrested Ahmad Al-Mughassil, the mastermind behind the 1996 Alkhobar attacks. \n \nThe Kingdom also provided important information to the US that foiled a possible suicide attack in a plane flying over Detroit in 2009. It also uncovered the presence of a bomb hidden in an ink container on a plane bound for Chicago in October 2010. Apart from intelligence and security cooperation, the US knows that Saudi Arabia has paid the price for its own safety and security in its fight against terror. \n \nThe interlinked interests of the two countries make it difficult to put Saudi-US relations at risk. Economically, American companies have enormous investments in the Kingdom while Riyadh has huge deposits and investments in the US. Many senior Saudi officials graduated from American universities and there are currently 120,000 Saudi students studying in the US. \n \nIn the context of what I have outlined, certain disagreements between the two countries are expected but their shared interests are stronger and dwarf the differences. It is important to concentrate on, and develop, this relationship for the benefit of both Saudi Arabia and the entire region with all its issues.
0993_7e859c86-8e2a-4e8f-9e57-f90c725487ce	Shaker Aamer, the last British resident held at Guantanamo Bay, is to be released, a British Government spokesman said. \n \nThe US government has notified the UK authorities that it now intends to return Mr Aamer to Britain. \n \n"The Government has regularly raised Mr Aamer's case with the US authorities and we support President (Barack) Obama's commitment to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay," the spokesman said. \n \n"In terms of next steps, we understand that the US Government has notified Congress of this decision and once that notice period has been concluded, Mr Aamer will be returned to the UK." \n \nMr Aamer, 46, a Saudi national, was originally detained in Afghanistan in 2001. \n \nHe was subsequently transferred to Guantanamo Bay where he has been held without charge. \n \nHis release is expected to take place once the 30 day notice period set by the US authorities has expired \n \nMr Aamer has been the subject of a long campaign to secure his release. Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said the news of his return was a "huge relief". \n \n"In the past Mr Aamer has reportedly been at death's door during a hunger strike and his return to his family in Britain won't come a moment too soon," she said. \n \n"The immediate focus should now be on providing medical and other support for Mr Aamer on his return to the UK, but let's not forget that his 13-year ordeal at Guantanamo has been an absolute travesty of justice." \n \nConservative MP David Davis, who has repeatedly called for Mr Aamer's release, said it was "great news". \n \nHe told the Press Association: "It is long overdue. It should have happened years ago - 13 years without having been charged with or indeed accused of any crime. \n \n"It is brilliant news for his family, who are British citizens, very good news for him and good news for justice. \n   Promoted stories   \n"I would like to give my commendation to the large number of people who have campaigned year in and year out for Shaker Aamer's release. For them this is a very great vindication." \n \nMr Davis said the process of releasing those held in the facility has been "pretty painful for the American government". \n \nHe said: "Let's hope (Mr Aamer's release) is implemented as quickly as humanly possible." \n \nSuccessive British governments have pursued a policy of pressing for the release of UK nationals and residents held by the US at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility on Cuba. \n \nDavid Cameron raised Mr Aamer's case with Mr Obama when they met in January and the decision to return him to the UK him was discussed by the two leaders again in a phone call on Thursday. \n \nOfficials would not discuss under what conditions he was being released. \n \nHowever, it is thought Mr Aamer - who described as a "close associate of Osama Bin Laden" who fought in the battle of Tora Bora in US files obtained by the WikiLeaks website - will be subject to monitoring by the security services on his return. \n \nThe Government spokesman said: "As the US has said, we have one of the most robust and effective systems in the world to deal with suspected terrorists and those suspected of engaging in terrorist related activity and we will continue to do all we can to protect people in Britain and around the world from the threat of terrorism." \n   \n Share article  \n   \nA senior US defence official said the final decision to return Mr Aamer to the UK had been approved by US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter. \n \nThe move was said to have followed a "thorough review of his case and taking into consideration the robust security assurances that will be provided by the British government, one of our strongest allies who has supported our efforts to close the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay".
0994_d4e350f6-680e-47e9-b929-3c7ed766267b	OAKLAND, Calif -- Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala revealed Monday that he received knee injections in Germany over the offseason. \n\nIguodala, 31, engaged in a treatment meant to ease joint soreness, but he did not elaborate on whether the treatment was the same as the orthokine shots that Kobe Bryant received annually in Germany. \n\n"My knees feel really good," Iguodala said Monday at Warriors Media Day of the procedure's effects. "I've been dunking a lot lately, which I normally don't do in the offseason." \n\nIguodala also joked that Warriors coach Steve Kerr "looked dead" after undergoing back surgery and said of his teammate Harrison Barnes' upcoming contract, "Harrison's number is so large, it doesn't matter. Rich is rich."
0995_22b8e3aa-9046-437c-9cb4-ad3a10c5b144	Principal Jerry Mayes with a group of students. Photo courtesy of Erin Woggon. \n \nThe principal’s office at duPont Manual High School is a place of distinction. It’s no secret the school is among the nation’s best. \n \nIn that office, Jerry Mayes effuses a palpable ambition. But in an apparent paradox, his most salient quality is humility. \n \n“I take what we do seriously,” he says, “but I don’t take myself very seriously.” \n \nWhen Mayes recounts his journey to the prestigious post, he makes scant mention of the attainments that landed him there. The principal himself seems mystified, being loath to own that his merits indeed commended him for the job. \n \n“What’re the chances of me, out of a nationwide search, becoming the principal of Manual High School? I just feel like for some reason I’m supposed to be here. I don’t know.” \n \nGrowing up in Louisville, Mayes wasn’t into sports – which is ironic, considering that he’d go on to become a football coach. His mother, who’d been among the second co-ed class to graduate from Manual, gave him a compulsory introduction to the sport. \n \n“When we went to the Manual-Male football games, I really didn’t know what was going on,” he recalls. “But I knew every Thanksgiving, I had to go to this game or we weren’t eating Thanksgiving dinner.” \n \nWhen Mayes was in the seventh grade, his parents divorced. “This guy by the name of Milon Perpich became my surrogate father, basically, and all I wanted to do was spend time with him,” he remembers. “And in order to spend time with him, I had to learn how to play sports.” \n \nMayes graduated from Butler Traditional High School then earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Morehead and UofL, respectively. \n \nHe took his first teaching job at Paul Blazer High School in Ashland, Ky., where he worked for two years. Then, he moved to St. Xavier High School, where he taught and coached football for about four years. \n \nAfter that, he accepted a coaching position at Morehead. A few years later, he was back in Louisville at Doss High School, and after that, he returned to St. Xavier as athletic director. \n \n“Then, I had the itch to get back into coaching,” he says. So he took a job as head football coach and advanced biology teacher at Manual. He subsequently became an assistant principal at Pleasure Ridge Park High School, where he spent 10 years. And in fall 2013, he became principal at duPont Manual High School. \n \nWithout question, it’s a station of honor. U.S. News and World Report ranked Manual No. 205 in its most current list of America’s best high schools and the second best high school in Kentucky. Niche.com placed it at No. 112 nationally and best in the state. And on TheBestSchools.org, the school came in at No. 45 in the U.S. \n \n“We have great schools all over Jefferson County,” Mayes says, “and each one of them serves a certain purpose. Ours just happens to be this unique set of kids who want to be in a very rigorous setting. I have the hardest working kids in town – no question.” \n \nLast year, Manual’s students earned $63 million in scholarships. The school offers 30 advanced placement courses, meaning students can graduate with as much as two years of college credit. \n \n“We take ownership of every kid in this building,” Mayes says. \n \nManual boasts exceptionally gifted teachers who regularly meet to discuss their students’ development. “I’m the smallest cog in this wheel,” Mayes says. “I really am. And that’s not some false humility. My biggest thing is to stay out of the way and let these guys do their job.” \n \nManual has a rich tradition of success, and Mayes preaches it to the freshmen: “When you come in here, understand this is a different cat.” As Mayes speaks, he taps the table repeatedly for emphasis. “… You have to accept carrying the torch for the hundreds of alumni that have gone before you.” \n \nManual is also rich in socioeconomic diversity. Minorities make up more than a third of its student body. The environment feels a lot like home to Mayes, whose daughters – 23, 20, 17 and 10 – are all adopted. \n \nHis wife, Marla Mayes, is a real estate agent with Breland Group Realtors. “My wife is phenomenal,” he says. “… She actually pushed me to go for this position and to do this.” \n \nThe statement is illustrative of Mayes’ career, even his personal life – he’s an unassuming man with a record of responding with mastery to a good push. \n \nMayes turns around the yellow notepad where he’s prepared his comments. Across the top he’s written: “May this be to your glory.” \n \nMayes doesn’t typically grant interviews, but he’s welcomed this one in the spirit that perhaps his story will inspire someone. “I really lean on my faith,” he says. “… That’s my base. That’s where everything comes from.” \n \nIt’s a faith that God makes everything happen for a reason, which is the only way Mayes feels comfortable accounting for his success. \n \n“Out of the blue, after a nationwide search, how do you explain that I end up being at one of the greatest places on earth?” VT \n      About the Author  Wesley Kerrick  Read more articles by this author >
0996_7651091d-e1a3-43c7-a103-e086ee664a33	(CNN) – Following the tradition of previous presidential spouses, first lady Michelle Obama is prepared to share her advice with the next first lady or first gentleman. \n\nObama dropped in on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Monday night, taking a break from the action at the United Nations to promote her “Let Girls Learn” campaign and joke with the host about state dinners and the next first family who could occupy the White House. \n\nColbert highlighted a letter to Obama by former first lady Laura Bush upon leaving the White House, asking, “Without naming names, if we have a female president next, would you leave a letter for her husband? What would you say? What’s the thing he needs to know more than anything else about the job?” \n\nObama replied, “I would say, follow your passion, just be you.” \n\nWithout missing a beat, Colbert made an apparent jab at Bill Clinton, saying “I think he does,” prompting a big laugh from the audience. \n\nWhile Obama protested, “That wasn’t me! I didn’t say it,” Colbert added, “I have never met Carly Fiorina’s husband, but I imagine he’s a lovely man.” \n\nWith the White House recently wrapping up a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Colbert took the opportunity to prod Obama about not getting an invitation to the high-profile state dinner held last Friday. Colbert, who attended a previous state dinner for French President Francois Hollande, quipped, “Haven’t heard from you much since then. You just had one with the Chinese president, didn’t get the call.” \n\nColbert also turned the conversation to Obama’s international campaign for education equality, which the White House touts as “a government-wide effort that will leverage the investments we have made and success we have achieved in global primary school and expand them to help adolescent girls complete their education.” \n\nColbert highlighted his own advocacy on the issue at the Global Citizens Festival in New York, cracking, “My issue for that weekend was girls’ education around the world, and I’m not saying you’re kind of jumping on my thing, but you are here to talk about ‘Let Girls learn.’ OK.”
0997_9e37c76e-f90a-4670-a914-99517c376783	Posted:  Monday, September 28, 2015, 1:24 PM    \n \nBy Emily Flitter \n \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday unveiled sweeping proposals to simplify the tax code, slash the corporate tax rate and impose a one-time levy on the overseas earnings of U.S. companies. \n \nIn a news conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan, he also vowed to eliminate deductions and loopholes for special interest groups if he becomes president at the November 2016 election. \n \n"It's a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again," Trump said, promising "major tax relief for middle income and most other Americans." \n   \nAlthough himself a billionaire entrepreneur, Trump is more willing than other Republicans to use anti-corporate rhetoric. \n \nThe real estate mogul said he would solve a longstanding problem with offshore profits that U.S. companies park abroad, estimated by experts to be worth at least $2.3 trillion. \n \nTrump suggested a one-off 10 percent tax on U.S. companies' profits held abroad whether they are repatriated or not. \n \n"Everybody agrees it should come back, Republicans, Democrats," he said. "The reason companies aren't bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn't make sense to bring it back," he said. The current tax rate for repatriated profits is 35 percent. \n \nTrump's plan on taxing overseas profits resembles proposals put forward by President Barack Obama and two senior senators, Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York and Republican Rob Portman of Ohio. \n \nTrump also said he would cap the tax rate for all businesses at 15 percent, compared to the present 35-percent top corporate rate. He vowed to eliminate the so-called death tax, formally known as the estate tax, and get rid of the "carried interest" loophole that lets private equity and hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than other people. \n \nHe also promised to simplify voters' tax returns by reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals to four from seven. \n \n(Writing by Alistair Bell; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Bill Rigby)
0998_225b7339-cfa8-4801-be39-bc1631ecf7de	When your child is sick and needs a prescription medication , you need to know the correct dosage, how often to give it, if it should be taken with a meal and of course, the side effects .   \n \nYet, you probably never give much thought to what is actually in the medication and how it’s prepared. What may surprise you is that prescriptions can actually be customized for your child with a technology known as compounding. \n \nFind out what compound pharmaceuticals are, how they can help your child get well and what you need to do to make sure they’re safe. \n \nWhat are compound pharmaceuticals? \nUnlike medications from pharmaceutical manufacturers which are formulated only one way, compound pharmaceuticals use the same pure, active chemicals that are in FDA-approved medications and customize them so they are specifically suited for the patient. \n \nFifty years ago, most prescription medications in the U.S. were compounded but as drug manufacturers started to make more medications that could help the general population, compounding became less common. \n \nYet since the 1980s, studies have shown that about 5 percent of patients of all ages were not having their needs met by commercial medications. Since most pharmacies fill 400 prescriptions per day, on average, there has been a growing need. \n  More on this...   \n“That’s 20 patients a day per pharmacy where their needs are not being met or they’re not being met the way they could be because the medication isn’t customized for them,” said Scott Karolchyk, vice president of formulations for QmedRx in Maitland, Flo. \n \nToday, the majority of medications for kids are compounded, especially those given to children in cardiology and neonatal departments in hospitals, Karolchyk said.   \n \nA compound pharmacy can change the concentration or dosage, make a suspension liquid or add a flavor to make it more palatable. It can also help a child who needs a specific medication that is currently unavailable or off the market. \n \nFor example, a compound pharmacy can work with the doctor to ensure that infants who are sensitive to a medication that contain several drugs  are treated with a medication that has minimal side effects, Karolchyk said. \n \nLikewise, a compound pharmacy can create a unique concoction by mixing two types of creams together for a skin condition, for example. A medication can also be reformulated to exclude an ingredient like gluten or a dye that a child is allergic or that a child can’t tolerate because of side effects. \n \nIs compounding safe? \nThere have been concerns in recent years about the safety of compounding pharmacies after a 2012 incident where 750 people developed fungal meningitis or other infections and 64 died from contaminated steroids dispensed by the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. \n \n“They were essentially acting as a manufacturer under the disguise of a compounder so it was total neglect and certainly not a fair representation of the average compounder who genuinely cares about the patients,” said Blake Powers, chief operating officer for QmedRx. \n\nUnlike drug manufacturers who are regulated by the FDA, the compound pharmaceutical industry is regulated by individual states. Nevertheless, there are strict guidelines including two key standards that compounding pharmacies must follow. One is the United States Pharmacopeia for both sterile and non-sterile preparations and the other is “good compounding practices,” or rules and regulations that all states follow. \n \nIn 2013, President Obama signed the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) into law. Under the law, compounding pharmacies are encouraged to register with the FDA. Once they do, they are classified as outsourcing facilities so they can sell bulk drugs to hospitals and healthcare centers for what’s known as “office use.” These pharmacies will also be subject to the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations and inspections by the FDA. \n \nYet since the registration is voluntary, not all pharmacies will be regulated by the FDA. \n \n“The medical community’s hope is that it will become more and more safe as compounding pharmacies are treated like manufacturers,” Dr. Carlo Reyes, an emergency medicine physician and pediatrician at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, Calif. \n \nWhat you need to know \nIf your child is prescribed a medication, ask your pediatrician if the medicine is necessary in that particular formulation. Also, if the only thing that is being changed is the flavor, find out if there is a way to make the medication more palatable without using a compound pharmacy. \n \nIt’s also a good idea to check with your insurance company because some may not cover the medication or have stipulations about the specific formulation. \n \nYour doctor may have a relationship with a compounding pharmacy or may hand you the prescription and let you find one yourself. Either way, ask your pharmacist if they have had problems with the compounding pharmacy. You can also check the FDA’s website for inspections and recalls. \n \nTo find a reputable compounding pharmacy in your area, search the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists and look for a pharmacy that holds accreditation from the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB), which only 2 percent do. \n \n“It proves that they are meeting or exceeding all the compounding standards and regulations to ensure that their products are quality and that they’re safe,” Karolchyk said. \n\nJulie Revelant is a health journalist and a consultant who provides content marketing and copywriting services for the healthcare industry.

0999_3754f5d1-4e7c-4f58-a426-14a1ddee3775	Outgoing House Speaker John A. Boehner, in his first one-on-one interview since announcing his resignation last week, compared conservative hard-liners in his party to biblical "false prophets" who promise more than they can deliver. \n \nBoehner announced Friday that he would step down Oct. 30 after nearly five years as speaker amid constant pressure from his party's right flank. Asked Sunday by host John Dickerson on a live broadcast of CBS's "Face the Nation" whether those hard-liners are "unrealistic about what can be done in government," Boehner exploded. \n \n"Absolutely, they're unrealistic!" he said. "But, you know, the Bible says beware of false prophets, and there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done." \n \nBoehner referred, as he has in the past, to the ill-fated 2013 shutdown over funding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare: "This plan never had a chance," he said, but he blamed outside forces for leading Republicans down an ill-advised path: "We got groups here in town, members of the House and Senate here in town, who whip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know — they know! — are never going to happen." \n \nDickerson followed up by asking whether Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the leading proponent of the 2013 shutdown, was a "false prophet." \n \n"Listen, you can pick a lot of names out; I'll let you choose 'em," Boehner said as he sipped from a coffee mug. He added: "I refer you to my remark at a fundraiser I made in August in Steamboat Springs, Colo." — a reference to a report, published in the Daily Caller , that he had called Cruz a "jackass" behind closed doors. \n \nEarlier Sunday, the leader of one of those outside groups who have pushed for greater confrontation cheered Boehner's departure. Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action for America, said on Fox News Sunday that Boehner and his allies treated conservatives as "crazies" to be marginalized, not as central players in developing the party agenda. \n \n"[Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi does not talk about her base that way; Barack Obama doesn't think about his base that way," Needham said. "We need a Republican leadership that is showing conservative values. ... That's not what we've had. We've had to fight our own speaker." \n \nBoehner addressed the remaining five weeks of his speakership, in which he pledged to "get as much finished as possible." Pressing matters include striking a deal with President Obama to keep the government open through the coming fiscal year, raising the federal borrowing limit, passing a long-term transportation bill and extending popular tax breaks. \n \n[ Congressional agenda thrown into disorder with Boehner's departure ] \n \n"I don't want to leave my successor a dirty barn," Boehner said. "So I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets here." \n \nOn Friday, he offered words of support for Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as a successor. He did not mention McCarthy on Sunday but offered advice to whoever follows him in the speaker's chair: "Have the courage to do what you can do. ... Just go do it." \n \n"In our system of government, it's not about Hail Mary passes; it's the Woody Hayes school of football," he said, referring to the legendary Ohio State University coach. "Three years and a cloud of dust. It's a slow, methodical process." \n \nMike DeBonis covers Congress and national politics for The Washington Post. He previously covered D.C. politics and government from 2007 to 2

Make safety in your workplace a priority. You should have a fire extinguisher and smoke detector in there. \n \nYou should think about what you use in your own life when you decide on a product that your work from home business will market and sell. Figuring out what consumers need is the most important step in choosing a product to sell. If you have noticed a specific need for a certain product, you can be sure that others have experienced that need as well. \n \nTIP! Set up a place in your home that you can designate as your work space. Make sure that your work space has room to organize the supplies you need. \n \nThe first thing you need to do when starting up your home business enterprise is to sign-up for a new PO Box. Don’t put your home address on the Internet if you don’t have to. You’ll be protected from people who might not have proper intentions. \n \nTIP! Promoting your business is the only way to get it out in the open. If you’re speaking with someone and they say something related to your business, start talking about it. \n \nTry to find the average market price before you sell something. This clues you in on what customers are willing to pay for your product or service. Look at your competitors’ prices so you can offer your product at a slightly cheaper cost.

If you are including a web site, research how your target audience likes to interact with online options, and design the site accordingly. \n \nTIP! In business, spend 20% of your time learning, and the other 80% of your time doing. Doing means making money, so whatever your business might be, you need to be actually creating, calling, emailing, whatever actions you must take to bring in income. \n \nTalk to a lawyer before starting your work at work from home business. Many states have laws pertaining to home businesses. By contacting a business lawyer, you will be able to find out what your state laws are and make sure that you are following them so that you do not get into trouble with the state. \n \nTIP! Advertising by word of mouth is cheap and can be one of the best ways to advertise a business. People are more likely to try businesses their friends recommend rather than those advertised by strangers. \n \nMake sure your website it memorable and eye catching. Choosing a domain name that is very long or too hard to recall can make potential customers forget it. Keep it simple — and keep it catchy — when making a domain name. \n \nTIP!

Make sure you stay on top of record keeping so you can get the most out of your tax deductions and also to help if you are audited. \n \nTIP! Manage time effectively. Businesses from home need much of your time, because you lack a staff to handle small tasks. \n \nHome businesses need to have a website in today’s world.

You can write this off, which is good considering how many miles can add up. This can be a pretty large write off. \n \nTIP!
