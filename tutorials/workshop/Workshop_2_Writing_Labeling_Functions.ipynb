    "## Part 2: Writing  Labeling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snorkel, our primary interface through which we provide training signal to the end extraction model we are training is by writing **labeling functions (LFs)** (as opposed to hand-labeling massive training sets).  We'll go through some examples for our spouse classification task below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeling function is a Python function that accepts a candidate, or a row of the DataFrame, as the input argument and outputs a label for the candidate. For ease of exposition in this notebook, we return `1` if it says the pair of persons in the candidate were married at some point,  `-1` if the pair of persons in the candidate were never married, and `0` if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are often unipolar: it labels only `1`s and `0`s, or it labels only `-1`s and `0`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note we will change our mapping to use `2` to represent the absence of a relationship to match the multiclass convention in the next notebook for the `LabelModel`. This does not affect this notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to ultimately train a high-performance classification model that predicts which of our candidates are true spouse relations. It turns out that we can do this by writing potentially low-quality labeling functions!"

    "## C. Writing Custom Labeling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of LFs is that you can write any arbitrary function and use it to supervise a classification task. This approach can combine many of the same strategies discussed above or encode other information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we observe that when mentions of person names occur far apart in a sentence, this is a good indicator that the candidate's label is False. You can write a labeling function that uses preprocessor `get_text_between` or the existing field `get_between_tokens` to write such an LF!\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "**IMPORTANT** Good labeling functions manage a trade-off between high coverage and high precision. When constructing your dictionaries, think about building larger, noiser sets of terms instead of relying on 1 or 2 keywords. Sometimes a single word can be very predictive (e.g., `ex-wife`) but it's almost always better to define something more general, such as a regular expression pattern capturing _any_ string with the `ex-` prefix. \n",
